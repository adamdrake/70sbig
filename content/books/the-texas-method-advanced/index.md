## The Texas Method: Advanced

You&#8217;ve been on the Texas Method for a while, and you&#8217;ve even implemented some of the changes from <a href="/books/the-texas-method-part-1/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Part 1</a>, but progress is starting to slow. After all, no program will work forever. Do not fret, for over the last several years we have been learning and tweaking this program into an amazingly efficient machine that has yielded a 661 competition squat, a <a href="http://youtu.be/jXlgEPzEU8g" target="_blank">705 competition deadlift</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/os9u1Ca25js?t=1m49s" target="_blank">402 competition bench press</a>, and a 275&#215;3 standing press.

The Texas Method: Advanced teaches you how to control dosages of volume, how to structure the program for use in raw powerlifting, and a variety of important programmatic tweaks that will push you past your sticking points. There&#8217;s 90 pages of information, and most of it can be pulled and used in almost any program. This is the most proven and effective programming tool 70&#8217;s Big has created to date. And did I mention that the forward is written by Brent Kim? Now you know it&#8217;s good.
