## The Texas Method: Part 1

All readers on 70&#8217;s Big want to get strong, and almost all of them want to get big _and_ strong. They will use a linear progression like Starting Strength or the Greyskull LP, yet seem sort of lost as to what to do next. The Texas Method is typically recommended, yet there isn&#8217;t a clear guide on how to transition into it, how to properly progress it, how to tweak it as you advance, or how to use it for sub-goals like weightlifting and swollertrophy. Until now.

> Dear Justin,
> 
> I recently purchased your ebook on the Texas Method. First of all, thank you so much. I really appreciate you clarifying many questions I had about the intricacies of the program. I ran SS and completed it going from 155 to 205lbs. Im 6&#8217;0 and hope the TM can help me along to attaining my goal of becoming 220lb because thats the weight class I want to compete at when I powerlift. I&#8217;m now currently 16 weeks into TM and the information you provided will definitely benefit me greatly.

> Sincerely,
