## Welcome, finally, to 70sBig.com!

This website will be a haven for anyone involved in strength training. There are many exciting features that this site will offer, and those features will be revealed in the next few weeks.

There will be frequent postings throughout the week, and eventually it will thrive on content from you, the viewer. We will welcome numerous forms of media that will be shared with your 70’s Big brethren. More on this soon.
