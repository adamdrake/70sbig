## &#8220;All you got to do is listen&#8221;

Every Monday and Thursday we’ll post parts of the Mark Rippetoe interview. For those of you who don’t know, Rip is a barbell coach who originally learned under Bill Starr and has been coaching the lifts for about 30 years. Currently he writes as well as travels to coach at barbell seminars. You can learn about his work at [The Aasgaard Company’s website][1].
  

  
Here is part two if the interview:
  


[70’s Big Presents: Interview with Mark Rippetoe Pt. 2][2] from [70s Big][3] on [Vimeo][4].
  

  
We have quite a few people getting 70’s Big at the WFAC. Shelley and Melissa get stronger every week despite obscure injuries, Colton and Kyle are our young apprentices in strength, both of the Zachs are still trying to gain enough weight to be classified as adult males, Sammerr aims to be a decent Olympic lifter, Sam is always begged to eat more despite his strength to bodyweight ratio, and Kyle battles horrific anthropometry.
  

  
I work with a lot of people here, and they all aim to get stronger (and sometimes conditioned). What gym are you at? Who else do you know that is trying to get 70’s Big? We’d like to hear about it. Eventually we’ll make an archive of gyms that are conducive to being 70’s Big.
