## &#8220;What do I eat?&#8221;

I get a lot of questions about what kind of stuff someone should eat if they are trying to get 70’s Big. Well, recently I wrote out a food log for my pal Cliff. Remember, getting enough protein and calories is vital, especially when dealing with a guy that has been skinny his whole life. Cliff needed an extra boost to continue his novice linear progression, and here is what we did:

  <p style="text-align: left">
    Here are a few things to note:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      I immensely underestimated the calories for some of the snacks, especially the ice cream and magic shell combo
    </li>
    <li>
      The &#8220;10 oz&#8221; refers to sirloin steak
    </li>
    <li>
      The &#8220;8 oz&#8221; refers to chicken breasts
    </li>
    <li>
      Notice he eats two of each per day
    </li>
    <li>
      Cliff drinks a gallon of whole milk a day
    </li>
    <li>
      Cliff was only eating almonds for a snack at work, now it is calorie dense trail mix
    </li>
    <li>
      Cliff found ice cream and nutella to be a nice little combo at night
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p style="text-align: left">
    <br /> The most important points are that Cliff has increased his bodyweight from 185 to 215, improved his squat from 145x5x3 to doing 305x5x3 last night, and launched his deadlift from 225&#215;5 to 405&#215;5. All this in 2.5 months.<br /> <br /> No, he is not fat. When you are skinny your whole life, not only is it hard to gain fat, but you don’t get to have an opinion on what fat is.<br /> <br /> And he’s not done yet.<br /> Let us know about any cool meals or snacks that have helped you recover. Remember, you can e-mail videos or pictures to <a href="mailto:media@70sbig.com">media@70sbig.com</a>.<br />

    As promised, here is the fourth part of the 70’s Big Interview with Rip:<br />

A story will be told about how he was an imposing individual who was respected by the entire powerlifting community. This is why he is the co-captain of 70sBig.com, and why he is our first entry into the &#8220;70&rsquo;s Big Hall of Fame&#8221;.
