    <strong>Pisarenko Week</strong> continues with a look at Pisarenko’s championships. The Pizz won multiple USSR Championships (1982 and 1984), European Championships (1981, 1982, 1983, and 1984), and World Championships (1981, 1982, and 1983). Pisarenko set 13 world records in his short career in the super heavyweight class.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he was unable to participate in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics. He missed out on the 1980 Olympics because two of his veteran teammates were selected to lift for the USSR (even though he lifted more than both of them). In 1984, the USSR pulled out of the Olympics for a number of political reasons. By the 1988 Olympics, Pisarenko’s lifting career was over.<br /> <br /> Check out <a href="http://www.chidlovski.net/liftup/l_athleteResult.asp?a_id=524" target="_blank">this website</a> for a detailed look at his championships and totals.<br /> <br /> The following video is from the 1982 World Championships and outlines Pisarenko’s battle with Antonio Krastev (Bulgaria). It shows the top snatches in the super heavyweight weight class. This is a rare look at Pisarenko lifting in a meet and speaking with his coaches backstage. Tomorrow we will watch Krastev and Pisarenko battle in the clean and jerk finale. Enjoy watching this beast of a man.<br /> <br /> <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BKQGTEv0W0?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span><br /> <br /> <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Pisarenko was a former Greco-Roman wrestler. I can&rsquo;t think of any males that would like to have his hands on them. Females, however, are a different story.<br />
