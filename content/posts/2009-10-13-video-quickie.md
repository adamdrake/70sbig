## &#8220;I never used ammonia, it always pissed me off&#8221;

I&rsquo;m a bit late posting because we got in late last night from doing a barbell seminar in Denver &#8212; a guy needs sleep, ok?
  

  
It&rsquo;s a lot of fun having friends who are strong, and my good friend AC is one of those people who is pain-in-the-ass strong. He&rsquo;s on the brink of plateauing in his linear progression. Yesterday he squatted 450 for three sets of five, pressed 212 for three sets of five, and a few weeks ago deadlifted 500 for five&#8230;all at a bodyweight of 205. Oh, and he&rsquo;s 20 years old.
  

  
Since he has pretty much linearly progressed his deadlift, I gave him the green light to work up to a 1RM yesterday. Keep in mind that he squatted and pressed the previously mentioned numbers before pulling this.

He missed 575 at the knees after that last attempt. AC will start competing in powerlifting and eventually weightlifting. He&rsquo;s also a pretty good coach, so if you&rsquo;re in the Atlanta area and want some coaching, [e-mail him][4]. You can also find him in south Georgia when he&rsquo;s at school.
  

  
AC is also the one who edits the Rippetoe interview videos, and here is part 7 of the 70&rsquo;s Big Interview with Rip:
