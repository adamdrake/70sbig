## &#8220;Don&rsquo;t forget: there is a good lookin’ female drinking more milk than you are&#8221;

We’ve had a few posts that explain what type and amounts of food you’ll need to consume if you’re wanting to get 70’s Big. Some people, however, don’t realize the purpose of this level of food intake. As always, it depends on your individual situation.
  

  
No one is suggesting you eat a giant bowl of ice cream, brownies, and magic shell if you already weigh 250. However, if you weigh 150, you better be stuffing your face. The &#8220;professional eating&#8221; approach is always suggested for guys who weigh under 200 pounds.
  

  
Remember: **Adult Males > 200 pounds**
  

  
A gallon of whole milk a day usually does the trick, regardless of who you are. My buddy John Sheaffer and I both drink at least a gallon, and I weigh 225 and he weighs 235 (he’ll be making a strong push to get to 250 by December, and eventually will make it to 275). Whole milk has a beautiful balance of calories, fat, carboydrates, and protein. Remember, it exists to make baby mammals grow, so start suckling the teat of growth.
  

  
There is a good looking girl at [the gym we held a seminar at][1] in Denver this past weekend. The gym owners, Jodi and Skip, told me that she drinks 6 gallons of milk a week while strength training, weightlifting, and doing conditioning workouts. She weighs 150 with very little bodyfat. In other words, she eats according to the needs of her activity and sport. If you’re trying to gain considerable size and strength, go with the shovel technique. If you are at the optimum bodyweight at your given height, then eat to maintain the muscle mass you already have. In any case, don’t ever forget that there is a good looking female who is drinking more milk than you are.

The following photo was submitted by Randy, a deployed US Marine. Apparently they can’t get a gallon of milk when deployed, so they have to get creative with their calories.

Here is part 8 of the 70’s Big Interview with Rippetoe.

[70&rsquo;s Big Presents: Mark Rippetoe Interview Pt. 8][2] from [70s Big][3] on [Vimeo][4].
  

  
Rip references the directory of 70’s Big conducive gyms in this video. **It will be very difficult to be added to this select list**. The qualifying factors include your openness to helping new members, equipment, gym philosophy, the training of the owner(s), and a stable of people that are working to get strong. This list will be comparable to Bill Starr’s list of &#8220;Gyms Friendly To Weightlifters&#8221; that was published in <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&rn=294&action=show_detail" target="_blank">Defying Gravity</a> (a good, quick read for anybody competing in the barbell sports).
