## &#8220;Why would anyone want to eat like that?&#8221;

I&rsquo;ve always liked food. I&rsquo;ll admit that I really didn&rsquo;t know how to eat it, though.
  

  
Rippetoe reminds me of a medieval gentile; meat and mead are all he needs. I&rsquo;ve seen him eat at least 10 different styles of meat, and every single one of them makes him say, &#8220;That&rsquo;s the best shit you could ever put in your mouth!&#8221;
  

  
My buddy Chris is a grilling aficionado. It&rsquo;s customary for him to grill pounds and pounds of meat, only to have them ground into satisfying bathroom visits within a day or so.
  

  
Gant is pretty serious about his eating, especially during a weight gaining phase. In fact, after the JM Blakely post, he brought in a two pound hunk of brisket to snack on while he trained. That&rsquo;s dedication.
  

  
Gant invited me over for dinner last night. Some how he knew my chicken fried steak quota for the week had not been met. I walked in the kitchen to see him frying steaks, frying biscuits, and preparing mashed potatoes. It was just what I needed.
  

  
We each had about a pound of meat, quite a few fried biscuits, and generous helpings of mashed potatoes. It was easily a 2,000 calorie meal. This meal is particularly interesting for Gant, because he&rsquo;s in the middle of moving back down to the 90 kilogram weight class for judo after competing in the 100 kg class. Hearty meals don&rsquo;t scare this man.

    Gant, Chris, and I were once eating at a local burger joint after training and we were all eating large double bacon cheeseburgers. This equals one pound of beef not counting the bacon, cheese, bun, or condiments. As we ate, Gant matter of factly said, &#8220;This is about the amount of protein your average CrossFitter would eat in a day while on the zone.&#8221; He was referencing The Zone Diet in which food is roughly weighed and measured for every meal. 16 blocks is a typical prescription, and this would equate to 16 ounces of meat. Chris, who weighed around 250 at the time, didn&rsquo;t understand. He stared, horrified at Gant, and said, &#8220;Why would anyone want to live like that?&#8221;<br /> <em>Edit: Brent was eating with us too. Sorry, Brent.</em><br /> <br /> Got any good food pictures? Gant and Chris love to document the food that they build, and you should too.<br />
