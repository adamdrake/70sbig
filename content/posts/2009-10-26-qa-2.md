## 70’s Big &#8212; making better lovers

My buddy Shawn and I were chatting via the interweb the other day. He has a valid concern regarding training.

> Shawn: Hey, so I have a serious topic for this 70’s Big business &#8212; blowing a load before 70’s Big training&#8230;
  
> Me: Elaborate.
  
> Shawn: For instance, I had sex last night.
  
> Shawn: And once today.
  
> Shawn: What are the ramifications on my training?
  
> Me: A valid question.
  
> Shawn: Wow, really?
  
> Me: Yeah. Bill Starr has talked about it before.
  
> Shawn: I know Rocky was against having women during training&#8230;
  
> Shawn: But Rocky was a joke, man.
  
> Me: Yeah he was.
  
> Me: Well, we’re gonna have to talk about this on the site, then.
  
> Me: If your stupid-ass is asking, then other people are too.
  
> Shawn: Yeah, I mean, I don’t want a BJ affecting my gains.
  
> Shawn: Or do I&#8230;?

The real question is: will sex, or its derivatives (like hand shandies), disrupt recovery and adaptation for strength? Hardly.
  

  
In fact, a case could probably be made that the exclusion of sexual activities would actually _interfere_ with getting stronger &#8212; it&rsquo;s science. Besides, who am I to tell a strapping lad (or female) to lay off their sexual escapades? I couldn’t think of a better way to lose readers. If a bout of vigorous sex interferes with tomorrow’s training session&#8230;well, high fives all around, I say.
  

  
Competition is another matter entirely. I&rsquo;ve heard of professional athletes, particularly football players, vehemently take a &#8220;no sex&#8221; stance the night before a game.
  

  
I guess the first question is, how important is the meet or game? If you have trained hard for it, then it should be pretty damn important. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to ruin your moxie on the account of some rowdy hanky panky. I’ll refer to an expert on the matter. Here is an excerpt from Bill Starr’s <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&rn=294&action=show_detail" target="_blank"><em>Defying Gravity</em></a>.

> The bottom line on sexual activity before a contest comes down to being sensible, basic advice. During the last weeks and especially during the final days, you should continue to follow the sexual patterns to which you are accustomed. If you are in the habit of getting laid every night, keep doing it. Your body chemistry is definitely geared for this activity and abstaining will throw it off. If, on the other hand, you haven’t tapped the prostrate in a month or so, then you certainly don’t want to be looking up old girl friends or hanging out looking for loose leg the night before the contest. A rather famous quote from former New York Yankee manager Casey Stengle, exemplifies the point. &#8220;It isn’t sex that wrecks these guys, it’s staying up all night looking for it.&#8221; Good point. Quite often, the villain is not the sex but the loss of rest.

This book was written by Starr to prepare an athlete for their next weightlifting or power meet. It&rsquo;s chock full of useful information, hilarious stories from his era, and pictures of impressive lifters (you know, guys that are 70&rsquo;s Big). Starr’s main concensus was keep doing what you are doing, at least physiologically speaking. The aim is to keep the body functioning normally in those final days before the competition &#8212; don&rsquo;t start a new habit or stop on old one so that there is optimal physical and mental performance.
  

  
There&rsquo;s plenty of time for &#8220;performing&#8221; _after_ the meet. High five.
