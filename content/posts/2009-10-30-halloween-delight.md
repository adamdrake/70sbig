## Your Halloween present: 70&rsquo;s Big t-shirts

I was in tenth grade the first time it happened. I un-racked the bar on my front deltoids with my elbows high. I stepped back a few feet, got my stance set, and squatted down. I heard a very peculiar ripping sound, and then a quasi-delightful breeze tickled my butt crack. It took a minute or two to realize that I had blown out the back of my boxers front squatting. That was the first time my ass became too big for the clothes I was wearing.
  

  
Fast forward until a few months ago. We were in Salt Lake City to work a barbell seminar and I squatted down to pet a sweet ol&rsquo; chocolate lab at the gym and&#8230;

Right when it happened I was shocked. The jeans made a cartoon-like ripping noise and I just looked up and said, &#8220;70&rsquo;s Big&#8221;.
  

  
I tell ya, folks, nobody said 70’s Big was gonna be easy. I&rsquo;ve ruined several pairs of boxer briefs &#8212; blowing out the butt crack just like tenth grade. I&rsquo;ve ripped the seams on numerous spandex compression shorts. I&rsquo;m outgrowing the athletic shorts that I bought for when I was outgrowing my old athletic shorts. I had to move up a t-shirt size. None of my pairs of non-ripped jeans really fit, specifically in the butt and crotch region (zing!). And I was already 195 when I fit into these clothes!
  

  
It&rsquo;s a badge of honor to accidentally (key word here) rip through old clothing. How many seams have you busted today?

Happy Halloween to all of you. I fully expect you to present me with awesome pictures of you in 70&rsquo;s Big attire throughout the weekend. Keep in mind you can still wear it while you train on Friday or watch football on Saturday. My present to you? The first 70&rsquo;s Big t-shirt. Without further ado&#8230;
