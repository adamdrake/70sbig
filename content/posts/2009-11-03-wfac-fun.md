    If you missed Rippetoe’s interview with <a href="http://ironradio.org/">Iron Radio</a>, you can find it <a href="http://instantteleseminar.com/?eventid=9738822">here</a>.<br /> <br /> Rip didn’t have some of his facts straight about some of the lifters here at the <a href="http://www.wfac-gym.com/">WFAC</a>. Zach is one of the guys mentioned in the interview who has had a lot of success since he’s been at the gym. Zach has been training here for 9 weeks, and here are his actual numbers (all lifting numbers are for three sets of five, power cleans are five sets of three):<br /> <br /> Body weight: 162 &#8211;> 210<br /> Squat: 155 &#8211;> 295<br /> Press: 85 &#8211;> 125<br /> Deadlift: 225 &#8211;> 285<br /> Bench: 165 &#8211;> 197<br /> Power Clean: 50 kg &#8211;> 70 kg<br /> <br /> The program he used was the standard linear progression that is outlined in <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199">Starting Strength</a>. Zach eats a lot of food, drinks a lot of milk, and has gone from a guy who is 90’s Small to a guy on a quest to 70’s Big. Oh, and for all of you confused critics, he <em>may</em> have gained 8 pounds of fat, but I doubt it’s that much. Well worth it for the increase in strength, size, and muscle mass.<br /> <br /> If you have anybody that has had a lot of success with gaining strength and bodyweight, <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">send it on in</a>.<br /> <br /> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br /> <br /> Someone wrote in and requested a video of me doing some power cleans. I had meant to film my training today when I power cleaned and jerked 140 kg for five singles, but I forgot. Instead, I filmed the second set of squats I did immediately following the C&J. Notice the Pacifico-style glasses and socks. If you want to send in some videos of you or anybody that you coach lifting, <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">send it on in</a>.
