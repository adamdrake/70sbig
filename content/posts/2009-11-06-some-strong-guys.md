## Guess the quote:
  
&#8220;Hey, Big Mike, how are you doing?&#8221;

Enough about me, let&rsquo;s talk about some strong guys.
  

  
Werner Günthör was a Swiss shot putter in the late eighties and early nineties. He won a European Championship (1986), a World Indoor Championship (1991), some World Championships (1987, 1991, 1993), competed in the 1984, 1988, and 1992 Olympics, and won a Bronze Medal in the 1988 summer games.
  

  
Aside from success as a thrower, Günthör is 6&rsquo;7&#8243;, 280 pounds with a solid &rsquo; stache and a feverish mullet. Observe&#8230;

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

Here’s a picture of 70’s Big HoF shoe-in John Kuc from the 1979 World Powerlifting Championships. Kuc is pulling 859 lbs in the 242 class to total 2127 lbs &#8212; both world records at the time. This meet also had other powerlifting greats such as Lamar Gant, Larry Pacifico, and Bill Kazmaier winning their respective weight classes. On a side note, Rip has the original Powerlifting USA magazine that originally published [this photo][1]. He has tons of magazines, and I&rsquo;ll be scanning pictures out of them soon &#8212; especially of the good lookin&rsquo; ladies.

I received a video from 70&rsquo;s Big enthusiast Mike from Mississippi. He lost his arm when he was fifteen in a machine related accident, but he is figuring out ways to train his 6&rsquo;6&#8243;, 288 pound frame. The bar he&rsquo;s using in this video is bent all to hell, but he still manages to front squat 135 with his one good arm. You can read more about him and his training [here][2]. Oh, and he&rsquo;s also sporting the 70&rsquo;s Big t-shirt. Lookin&rsquo; good, Mike, lookin&rsquo; good.

If you guys have any videos of you or your trainees training, [send them on in][3].
  

  
Off to Seattle this weekend to work a barbell seminar. Eat well and recover this weekend.
