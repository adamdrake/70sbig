Well, I have not had a computer since we have been in Seattle, so I have not been able to post. I do not have much time now, so there will be a full report Wednesday.
  

  
Last night I clean and jerked 140 kilos for five singles &#8212; the most I have ever done. Afterwords I squatted 204 kilos for three sets of five. My trunk is and was absolutely destroyed after doing this. If anybody tells you that the basic barbell exercises &#8212; squat, press, deadlift, bench, clean and jerk, and snatch &#8212; do not work the &#8220;core&#8221;, please tell them to kindly fuck off.
  

  
_Note: I had literally 2 minutes to type this post last night, and I had intended on typing &#8220;core&#8221; as a very tongue-in-cheek comment. Hopefully I got that across, but we definitely do not use the term &#8220;core&#8221;._
