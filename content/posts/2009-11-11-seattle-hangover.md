I just got home to Wichita Falls, and it is 12:30 AM local time. Airline delays are delightful. This means that I won&rsquo;t be giving you a full recap of the trip today. I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not sorry. There will be plenty of shenanigans coming tomorrow.
  

  
In the mean time, enjoy this video AC made of his &#8220;Starting Strength Crew&#8221; in Statesboro, GA. Good group.

Raise your hand if you have hit any PR&rsquo;s lately. I think we need to have weekly updates of them &#8212; bodyweight gain or otherwise. [Send them in][4], fool.
