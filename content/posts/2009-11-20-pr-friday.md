All right ladies and gents, post your weekly PR&rsquo;s. I had a shitty-ass training week, and the only thing I really accomplished was squatting 455x5x3 on Tuesday. I&rsquo;ll have to do my Friday workout on the road because we are going to Huntington Beach, CA for a seminar.
  

  
In other news, AC is competing in a USAPL meet tomorrow. I don&rsquo;t believe in luck, but if you want to wish it to him, you can do so in the comments. He will compete in the 220 class and will probably post his openers and body weight here in a bit. AC claims to be making a video documentary of the meet, so we&rsquo;ll see what happens. And AC; make me proud you little bastard.
  

  
Chris will compete in a meet soon as well. Here is a video of Chris from early September pulling 600 and 625 (with a bit o&rsquo; hitching).
