We got back late Monday night from doing a barbell seminar in Huntington Beach, CA. I would not advise anyone visiting or continuing to live in that state. To California residents: I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not sorry. More on the trip tomorrow&#8230;
  

  
You may remember that on Friday, I mentioned that AC was going to compete in a USAPL meet. He did 70&rsquo;s Big justice going 7 for 9, and I&rsquo;m proud of him.
  

  
Competing in the 220 lb class&#8230;
  
Body weight: 204 (on their scale, he was around 208-209 on his scale)
  
Squat: 529 (raw state record)
  
Bench: 368 (raw state record
  
Deadlift: 568

_Edit: AC went 7 of 9. I typed it wrong last night for some reason. I was in a hurry._
