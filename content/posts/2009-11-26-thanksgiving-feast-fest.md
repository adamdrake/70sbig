## Hi, mom

This is the day that we all have been waiting for. This is the day when **everybody that you know** will be building (yes, building) and eating lots of food. Thanksgiving is a 70&rsquo;s Big holiday.
  

  
Everyone we know is going to be eating lots of food?!? And they are going to be giving away leftovers?!!? My friends, it is raining calories.

I know some of you bigger guys may be trying to reduce your carbohydrate intake for the sake of body composition, but I think we can all agree that you should exempt yourself from such annoyances today. Realistically speaking, everyone should do the same. The malnourished Zone Dieters need this day just as much as we do. It will let them feel human again.
  

  
Go forth on this day and eat comically massive amounts of food. Enjoy the company of your friends, but don&rsquo;t let them get between you and the next plate of food.
  

  
Unfortunately I won&rsquo;t be eating with my mom today since I am in Texas. Her Thanksgiving smörgåsbord (to use the term again) sets the standard for all 70&rsquo;s Big meals. Nothing compares. Miss ya, Mom.

Here is another video from the WFAC. On November 13th I squatted 485 for a set of 5. It was the intensity day on the Texas Method, and I think I could have driven the 5RM up to 500 had I not altered my program for an Olympic weightlifting emphasis. I intentionally did not edit this video so you can get an idea of what goes on before and after the set. 

After I come out from under the bar, Rip tells me my stance was about an inch wide. The tendency to widen the stance is exacerbated by an increase in weight, and some times a lifter may have to think about keeping it more narrow than they would want it. My reps are kind of slow in the beginning, but they increase with speed as I use my bounce a little better. The knees click in on the fourth rep (which I felt), but the 5th rep looks pretty good, given the stance.
  

  
As always, [you can send in your own training videos][1].
