## &#8220;You can&rsquo;t just go around killing people!&#8221;
  
&#8220;Why not? I&rsquo;m a Terminator.&#8221;

At 70â€™s Big I have always encouraged people to compete in something so that training can be pinpointed to a goal. Competing is a lot of fun, it makes training more interested, and it gives you more of a sense of purpose than just exercising (which is what you do if you say, &#8220;I just want to get better at everything, tee hee!&#8221;).
  

  
Well, if you ever were interested in competing in the barbell sports (powerlifting or weightlifting), then you better get acquainted with the rules.
  

  
USA Powerlifting (<a href="http://www.usapowerlifting.com/index.shtml" target="_blank">USAPL</a>) is a member of the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF). Their rule book is found <a href="http://usapowerlifting.com/lifterscorner/USAPLHandbook2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
  

  
USA Weightlifting (<a href="http://weightlifting.teamusa.org/" target="_blank">USAW</a>) is a member of the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF). Their rule book is found <a href="http://weightlifting.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/4688/USAW_TECHNICAL__DOPING_RULES_as_of_November_2008.doc" target="_blank">here</a>.
  

  
It&rsquo;s a good idea to become acquainted with the rules so that you don&rsquo;t have a booboo in a meet. Kinda like Jacob did on his third attempt squat&#8230;

Nevertheless, nice job, Jacob. I will let him recap the meet in the comments.
