## &#8220;And how did I know what to say? _(whispering)_ The words were written down for me in a script.&#8221;

Some of you may remember an article I posted around August of this year that was a combination of barbell training and general physical preparedness. I&rsquo;ve decided not to post the original article because some of the terminology is not entirely accurate and it needs updating. However, the basic outline of the program included strength workouts on Monday and Thursday and conditioning workouts on Tuesday and Friday. It is designed for a novice who for some reason opts not to gain strength as quickly and wants to improve their conditioning (useful for folks in the military).
  

  
Monday &#8212; Squat, Press, Power Clean
  
Tuesday &#8212; Chin-ups, Conditioning
  
Wednesday &#8212; OFF
  
Thursday &#8212; Squat, Bench, Deadlift
  
Friday &#8212; Conditioning
  

  
This program can be considered the gateway from a conditioning-only exercise regime to a what more closely resembles a training program. Taking people who do not strength train and having them squat, press, and pull twice a week is incredibly important. For sports that require a conditioning base, this program would be useful, but it isn&rsquo;t optimal for the general strength trainee. If we want to grow adult males and make people stronger, then they may need to be eased into a program like this. Conversions to useful training may not be automatic. More conversions means more strong people which means more defense against the inevitable zombie outbreak. Inevitable.
  

  
I mention this program because it is the basis for the novice Olympic weightlifting program we have been tinkering around with at the WFAC. There have been some questions about it, so we will talk about it tomorrow. Enjoy your Christmas Eve.

We also have a collection of really dorky videos ready for the site.
