## &#8220;Who is but the form of what, and what I am is a man in a mask.&#8221;

In case any of you have been trying to order [70&rsquo;s Big shirts][1], I did a poor job of re-supplying them when inventory was short. The delay in getting them delivered is my fault and has nothing to do with The Aasgaard Company. I&rsquo;m pretty new to this kind of thing, so I&rsquo;m learning from my mistakes.

Some of you have been asking how to break in a new, stiff belt. Rip and Mike teach you how to do so in the following video. AC does the editing on these. That means the Kenny Loggins thing was his idea.
