## &#8220;Hello. How &rsquo;bout that ride in? I guess that&rsquo;s why they call it Sin City.&#8221;

There is a lot of useless research done on how music affects performance. More importantly, most of us probably train to some kind of music. More than likely we will think that what someone else listens to is pretty terrible (and you can read this as &#8220;I probably don&rsquo;t like whatever you are listening to&#8221;). In any case, it might be interesting to see what everyone likes to listen to as they train. Thus the social observation begins, go ahead and post your favorite stuff to listen to as you train to the comments.
  

  
I myself like to listen to Chicago, especially the first and second album. I like Led Zeppelin and Queen too. I&rsquo;ve listened to the Black Keys recently. When I was still doing an intensity day for squat on the Texas Method (as well as the later stages of my linear progression) my favorite songs to squat to were
  

  
Chicago &#8211; I&rsquo;m A Man
  
Led Zeppelin &#8211; When the Levee Breaks
  
Led Zeppelin &#8211; Achilles Last Stand
  

  
Here is a video I posted a while back that has some of those songs (this was from the beginning of September):

But now I just let the album play out. I don&rsquo;t need music to get my adrenaline up since I can get it extremely high mentally, but good music can help get you going when feeling lethargic.
