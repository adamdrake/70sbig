I hope everyone had a good holiday and is ready to climb back under a bar. As promised, here is some more footage on how to prepare a simple version of an outstanding 70&rsquo;s Big offering from Texas.

Chicken fried steak is a piece of tenderized steak that is coated in seasoned flour, pan fried, and served with cream gravy (Yankees screw this part up and serve it with brown gravy or, ketchup, which is even worse). It is similar to Wiener Schnitzel (VEE ner!) and was brought to the promised land by German immigrants. Historians guess it originated in Bandera, but I&rsquo;d like to think that some Texan from New Braunfels sopped his biscuit with gravy outside of the saloon at Gruene and claimed the dish as his own.

CFS has amazing utility. Like pizza or fried chicken, it can be eaten any time of day. It can also be combined with most of the things it is served with. Drag a bit of CFS through your gravy mashed potatoes. Make a breakfast sandwich with fried potatoes and toast. It&rsquo;s all good.

There are a lot of regional variations and personal touches you can add. What I&rsquo;m showing you is a very simple recipe that will have your guests licking their fingers and asking for more.
  
  
</br>
  
You&rsquo;ll need:
  
* tenderized cubed steaks
  
* flour
  
* seasoning (S&P are fine)
  
* eggs
  
* milk
  
* cooking oil (vegetable is fine)
  
* potatoes
  
  
</br>
  
The first video talks you through the prep and putting it in the pan. The second is a quick mid-cook check. The third video goes into making gravy and mashed potatoes. Timing is crucial here because you want everything to be served hot. Sorry for the length. I hope they&rsquo;re helpful.

The plan is to eventually expand the FAQ into more general matters and include a video recipe section in the nutrition part. Submissions are welcome so long as the recipe promotes strength. There will be a link to new videos from the main page article, so don&rsquo;t worry about your fine work going unnoticed. Happy eating.

Edit: I want your help in closing out the Texas Three Step. I&rsquo;m talking about BBQ, CFS, and chili. I&rsquo;ve done two, and I want to get y&rsquo;all involved. Send me a recipe or a clip [gantgrimes@gmail.com], and we&rsquo;ll get it on the site. It can be measured to the teaspoon, or you can ballpark it like me (but remember chili&rsquo;s heritage&#8230;). No beans, please.

Edit 2: Casa Manana in Wichita Falls has a dish called chili steak, where two piece of greatness are combined. It features TWO chicken fried steaks (floured but not battered) covered with chili con carne and cheese. It&rsquo;s served with the mandatory red taco.
  
  
</br>
  
Edit 3: This comes from the late great Jerry Flemmons of Fort Worth, &#8220;As splendid and noble as barbecue and Tex-Mex are, both pale before the Great God Beef Dish, chicken fried steak. No single food better defines the Texas character; it has, in fact, become a kind of nutritive metaphor for the romanticized, prairie-hardened personality of Texans.&#8221;

That brings a tear to my eye.
