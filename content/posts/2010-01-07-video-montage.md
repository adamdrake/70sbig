## &#8220;Hey, is that where they filmed Terminator 2?&#8221;

AC made a pretty sweet video montage of footage from his trip out here in December. That trip also coincided with Mike Hom visiting Wichita Falls, so we were one big happy family. In this video you will see different types of lifters with different training goals.
  


[Texas Pt. 2][1] from [A.C.][2] on [Vimeo][3].

_Edit: I guess I&rsquo;m okay with me sitting on the toilet as the video&rsquo;s preview image&#8230;_
  
Stay warm and train hard &#8212; tomorrow is PR Friday.

I&rsquo;ve never met Sage Burgener, but we have some mutual friends. Apparently she&rsquo;s a cool gal, a weightlifter, a coach, and has a [funky little blog][4] where she reveals tips that she has picked up from her pops, [Mike Burgener][5]. More importantly, she likes the [70&rsquo;s Big t-shirt][6].
