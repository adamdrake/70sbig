## Note: The Prowler is not code for being a stalker.

We recorded a video talking about The Prowler sled from [Elite FTS][1]. I don&rsquo;t really remember what we said about it in the video, but if I recorded the video now, I&rsquo;d say that it is the PREMIER conditioning tool for the strength athlete.
  

  
The more I think about how to use The Prowler, the more I&rsquo;m impressed. You can literally attack any part of the energy systems continuum by varying the weight and work/rest ratio. Put a medium amount of weight on, and do sprint repeats. Put a light amount of weight on and push it a long distance. Put a whole lot of weight on and push it a short distance. Vary the speed in all of those examples. And I&rsquo;m not even scratching the surface.
  

  
The thing is versatile is hell, and now I have people using it on a regular basis. Kyle, a 15 year old weightlifter that I coach, gave some good insight after using The Prowler for the first time; &#8220;They should take people in prison and duct tape their hands to the prowler then release rabid dogs to chase them.&#8221; Crime rates would plummet since The Prowler is definitely an ass kicker.
  

  
Rip bought the Econo Prowler, which is a less expensive version of the original Prowler. You can read about it, see some videos, and see a review [here][2]. Again, I&rsquo;ve never met anybody from Elite FTS, and nobody asks me to endorse anything (c&rsquo;mon, this audience isn&rsquo;t that big), but if I were going to have another tool in addition to a bar, plates, and rack, this would be it.
