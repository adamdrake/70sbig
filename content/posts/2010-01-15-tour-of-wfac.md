## &#8220;I&rsquo;ll have you, Longhshanks!&#8221;

**It&rsquo;s PR Friday. Post weight lifted, gained, or eaten to comments.

The [WFAC][1] is better than your gym. I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not sorry. When AC was here we filmed a tour of the gym. I believe this is the first and only video tour. Enjoy our improvising.
  
_Note: I just realized AC edited out when I talk about my dog Leda. He is an asshole for that._
  


[WFAC Virtual Tour][2] from [A.C.][3] on [Vimeo][4].

Oh, and the Texas State Weightlifting Meet is happening on Saturday. We were supposed to have 11 lifters going, but that number has fallen to 6 (including me). [Here is the schedule][5]. Ignore the roided up Incredible Hulk who appears to be blowing out the back of his shorts with a monstrous fart.
