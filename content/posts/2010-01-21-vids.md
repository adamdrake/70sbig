**Starting Strength Seminar in Wichita Falls, TX**
  
If you are on the quest to get 70&rsquo;s Big or have considered coaching other people to get strong, then check out the new [Starting Strength Seminar][1]. You will learn the nitty gritty details on mechanics and anatomy, and then apply those lessons while coaching other people and getting coached while under the bar. There will be one at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club in Wichita Falls, Texas on February 26-28. This would be a good chance to train and learn at one of the [best gyms in the country][2].
