_The following is a post by Gary Gibson, a friend and contributor on the Starting Strength forums._
  

  
At 5&rsquo;10&#8243; and a little over 160 lbs, I used to cling to the absurd notion that I was somehow past quick &#8220;newbie&#8221; gains. You see, about 15 years ago I graduated from college at my full adult height and weighing only around 130 lbs. This looked as frighteningly malnourished as you imagine. I wondered why women didn&rsquo;t take me seriously as a potential mate even though I had a dazzling smile and a razor sharp eight-pack.
  

  
I spent the next decade squatting deeply, but with poor form. My overall programming was even worse and I fell under the sway of nonsense like HIT and partial-rep training. About five years ago, I convinced myself that I &#8220;just wasn&rsquo;t built to squat and bench press&#8221; and dedicated myself to the deadlift, various overhead presses and chin ups. I also got into learning the full versions of the Olympic lifts even though I was only about 150 lbs with a shaky 245-lb squat to legal depth.
  

  
About three years ago, I recognized my scrawny nonsense for what it was when I had a confrontation with a much larger guy in my construction job and had to back down because I realized that I was grossly outsized and outmatched, despite being able to full squat snatch my own bodyweight.

Over the next few months, I started taking the squat seriously again and got it up to 315 lbs while I hit a bodyweight of 160 lbs. About a year after that I entered my first powerlifting competition and squatted 347 lbs with just a belt and knee sleeves in the 75 kg class. I thought I&rsquo;d done pretty well considering how light and weak I had always been. I convinced myself that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly gain much more weight and that at best I&rsquo;d get a bit stronger in my current weight class and then that would be it.
  

  
By this time I&rsquo;d read Starting Strength and started frequenting Rip&rsquo;s online forum. I kept hearing about this GOMAD stuff, but just didn&rsquo;t think it applied to me. After all, I&rsquo;d been training properly for at least a couple of years and had gotten over three wheels on the squat! But Rip told me something that really stuck with me: &#8220;At your height you have to weigh 198 at least to be a competent powerlifter.&#8221;
  

  
198? Just didn&rsquo;t seem possible. But I&rsquo;d been bitten by the powerlifting bug and really wanted to get as big and strong as I could. So I started buying several gallons of milk at a time and dedicating myself to drinking a gallon each day.
  

  
I&rsquo;d gotten as high as the mid-170s with a 405-lb squat, but then I cut weight for what was supposed to be my third meet in December 2009. This decision came after a lot of deliberation. At my level, getting bigger and stronger should supersede making weight classes. Ironically the meet got canceled because of a snowstorm that crippled the entire region. I got down to 164, but I lost a lot of strength. This proved to be a perfect chance to prove the power of GOMAD and squats.
  

  
A week after the meet cancellation I embarked on a program of volume squats and bench presses, fueled by GOMAD. Almost exactly one month later I am 20 lbs heavier than that low of 164 and my 5RM squat has become the weight I use for sets of five across. Let me make that clear: I was 164 lbs last month with a max squat of around 370; one month later I&rsquo;m 184 lbs and am on track to a max squat of around 440. Will I actually squat 440 or more? Well, I could barely squat 335 for five last month and last night I used that weight for six sets of five&#8230;and the cycle isn&rsquo;t even half over. You can keep track of my progress by reading my log on the Starting Strength site.
  

  
To be big and strong I need to weigh at least 200 lbs at this height with a final goal around 220. I wonder how many other skinny minnies are malingering in gyms across the world, crying about skinny wrists and hard gaining. Funny thing is, I still don&rsquo;t look &#8220;big&#8221;&#8211;and I&rsquo;m far from 70&rsquo;s Big&#8211;despite a 20% increase in overall mass. I have to shake my head in disbelief when I imagine myself at 5&rsquo;10&#8243; and 150 lbs and thinking that that was Just Fine. 150 lbs is just fine&#8230;if you&rsquo;re 5&rsquo;4&#8243;. If you&rsquo;re a male of the average 5&rsquo;8&#8243; to 5&rsquo;10&#8243;, you need to weigh around 200 lbs if you want to be strong. You need to squat, eat big, and drink your GOMAD.
  

  
If you&rsquo;re starting out at 150 and under, then the eating big and the GOMAD can be scary and uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s going to seem like your gut&rsquo;s getting way to big for your skinny little limbs. But stick with it. Once your gut is full and round, your body will take this as a sign that it has the reserves to support growth. You will not grow if your body &#8220;thinks&#8221; it is in permanent semi-starvation mode. So eat big, drink your GOMAD and keep upping your squat.
