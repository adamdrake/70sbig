## Why Eat Lots?
  
Part 2 &#8211; The Health Hysteria

Eating more than enough is important to grow, and growing is necessary if one is going to get stronger. The fact that growth is required to get stronger shouldn&rsquo;t be novel, especially with how much I [have][1] [written][2] [about][3] [it][4].
  

  
I am under the impression that nobody here thinks you can continuously gain strength in a linear fashion forever, nor do they think that body weight gains will continuously increase. There is this thing called &#8220;diminishing returns&#8221; that shows up a lot in life (economics, strength gains, running fast, etc.). In other words, in a given situation where increases have been made, more is required to make the same increase, so improvement is slower. Progress is made, albeit slowly.
  

  
In other words, you will not forever be in &#8220;mass gaining mode&#8221;. Nobody here has ever suggested that you eat tons of food when you don&rsquo;t need to. If you are Fat Guy, you don&rsquo;t need to be going ape shit with the milk shakes and large pizzas, even though it may be fun. If you are a girl who needs to gain weight or get stronger, you obviously won&rsquo;t have the same dietary requirements as Skinny Guy does because you are hormonally different. However, if you _are_ Skinny Guy, then you better throw down if you want to get strong.
  

  
Skinny Guy has an interesting task. He needs to drink a gallon of milk a day and eat four hearty meals. He needs to have eggs-a-plenty, bacon, and toast for breakfast. Skinny Guy should be consuming meat throughout the day and inhaling trail mix. There are hundreds of ways to add calories &#8212; hop on over to the [Food FAQ][5] for help or ideas. After getting more than enough protein, Skinny Guy will purposely be sloppy with his caloric intake if he is going to get as strong as possible in the shortest amount of time. **If Skinny Guy is going to spend valuable time in the gym training, then he my as well eat, recover, and thrive so he doesn&rsquo;t waste his or my time**.
  

  
Skinny Guy may have been just Average Joe prior to his linear progression, or perhaps he was one of those &#8220;clean eaters&#8221;. It is understandable that Skinny Guy would fear eating tons of calories. After all, he is scared of losing his abs. Skinny (Weak) Guy shouts, &#8220;Hey, isn&rsquo;t this unhealthy? I don&rsquo;t want to have health problems!&#8221; Really, Skinny Guy?
  

  
The problem with this silly assumption is that it assumes you should eat like Homer Simpson for the rest of your life. Once you are done gaining lots of body weight, then you eat to maintain mass and/or increase lean body mass.
  

  
Since Skinny Guy is only going to be eating like this until he is no longer Skinny Guy, health issues are completely irrelevant. Do you really think that eating like The Blob for six months is going to pose long-term health risks? Unless you have some kind of pre-existing condition, You&rsquo;ll Be Fine.
  

  
Besides, when you are training hard competitively, you must recover if you are going to succeed or improve. This requires lots of calories, and you must get them any way you can. When you instantly use the fuel you consume to repair your body, problems don&rsquo;t exist. In other words, you can&rsquo;t compare the effects of a sedentary person eating like shit and someone who trains very, very hard. I laughed when all of those assholes said that if they only &#8220;cleaned up&#8221; Michael Phelps diet, he would be an even better performer. The food he eats is the only way he can physically consume the calories that his body needs in order to recover. If training hard is a normal part of your life, you will eventually learn this.
  

  
A) If you are under weight, you must eat lots and lots to not be under weight.
  
B) If you eat lots, you are doing this for the sole reason to get stronger by increasing your mass.
  
C) Unless you have pre-existing conditions, six months of eating sloppy is not going to adversely affect your health. It takes years of unhealthy habits to start causing problems. Just ask your parents.
  
D) Inefficient people are annoying, so just eat the fucking food.
  

  
Tomorrow I will finish up by detailing food intake for the lifting population that doesn&rsquo;t start with &#8220;Skinny&#8221; or end with &#8220;Guy&#8221;.

Steve sent this video in. He squats 350 for a single and says, &#8220;Not too pretty, but got the job done.&#8221; More importantly, watch the end of the vid.
