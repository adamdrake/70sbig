Apparently the whole town is having Internet issues. I was going to post for Justin, but my connection sucks, too, so I&#8221;m going mobile. Sorry, guys.

It has been a month since I did the steroid primer post. I have spent the last several weeks gathering facts and talking to current and former steroid users about the ins and outs of supplementation. I should have something pretty good for you by next week.

So, in addition to your normal PR Friday posts, ask me any questions you want answered about steroids and I&#8221;ll try to cover it next week.

In the meantime, check the trailer for BSF.
