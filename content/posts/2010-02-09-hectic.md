Things have been a bit hectic since the internet was screwy last week and then we traveled to San Diego for a Starting Strength Seminar this past weekend.
  

  
There are quite a few people from the seminar that have a lot of strength to gain. Don&rsquo;t think that these seminars are just for people who are experienced or strong; we had someone who weighed 130 pounds. There is no sense in ribbing him in the comments. Trust me, he received enough of that at the seminar. He, and some others, are aware of what they need to do in the coming months to get stronger and bigger. I look forward to hearing about their progress, and assuming they are successful, we will post their story about their quest to getting 70&rsquo;s Big.
  

  
Don&rsquo;t be afraid to sign up for the seminar because you may think you aren&rsquo;t &#8220;good enough&#8221;. Everyone comes out of the weekend with a better working knowledge of how barbell training works, they are better at coaching it, and they are better at doing it. Ther people who were brave enough to attend did very well.
  

  
In the mean time, check out this sweet-ass compilation of 70&rsquo;s Big fan favorite Ricky Bruch:
