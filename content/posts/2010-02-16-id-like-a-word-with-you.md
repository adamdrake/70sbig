## &#8220;If I tell ya the truth, I&rsquo;ll tell you a lie, but if you call me false I&rsquo;ll also tell you a lie&#8230;&#8221;

Look, I know Doug Young was taking steroids, okay? Do you think I am some kind of moron? Everybody was on steroids in the seventies, and I don&rsquo;t really care. Steroids are a tool utilized in order to recover &#8212; this is how they were used then, and this is how they are used now. I do not, and never have, taken steroids (if I did, I would be a shit-load stronger than I am now). All of my friends don&rsquo;t take steroids either. And that&rsquo;s the point.
  

  
What, you think a picture of my lousy 230 pound frame is going to inspire Skinny Guy to start lifting? No. I need everyone to epitomize something that is far beyond their reach so that they always have something to strive for. [Doug][1] and [The Pizz][2] do this. [Ricky][3] inspires you to train like you are insane. Us&#8230;not so much.

Just because a guy is on steroids doesn&rsquo;t make his success any less impressive. And just because most of us don&rsquo;t take them doesn&rsquo;t make us any better, or worse, than them. It&rsquo;s not like Doug Young wasn&rsquo;t a genetic specimen without them anyway, so grow up and quit worrying about it. If I set the bar high, then I give people something to strive for. So far the quest to being 70&rsquo;s Big has helped turn many boys into [men][4]. Everyone wins.

Here is some Reader Mail. Louis apparently had a PR on his squat workout in the linear progression. I am happy for Louis, but if I ever meet him I&rsquo;m gonna slap him upside the head for not including the weight he was squatting. This bone head&rsquo;s saving grace is the plug at the end of the vid&#8230;along with his beard that I felt that you should all see.
