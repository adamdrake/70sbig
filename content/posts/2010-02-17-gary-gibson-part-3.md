**Two Steps Forward, One Back**
  
by Gary Gibson
  


I got a lot of nerve showing up here again like this. I was called out as being decidedly not an adult male because at 5&rsquo;10&#8243; I am still under 200 lbs. And now I&rsquo;m even under-er.
  

  
The 2010 USAPL Florida State Powerlifting Championship is coming up in ten days and I&rsquo;m planning to compete in it. I&rsquo;d wanted to compete at least once in the 82.5 kg, but in my zeal to get bigger and stronger I jumped over an entire weight class in one month and landed square in the middle of the 90.0 kg.
  

  
I&rsquo;d competed at the tippy-top of the 75 kg class at exactly 165 lbs in September when I ground out a very hard 369 lb suitless/wrapless squat on my third attempt. (I also just missed a 474 lb deadlift by failing to lock out. Don&rsquo;t ask about my bench. Ever.) Next I went up to 175 lbs and a 405 single squat in the gym and then got smaller and weaker in an attempt to make the 75 kg once more at the 2009 USAPL Maryland States in December. The meet got canceled the night before because of that incredible snowstorm.
  

  
Heavy training began again in late December. In just over a month I went from 165 lbs and squatting 325&#215;3 to 185 lbs and 405x3x3. I even manage to hit a high bodyweight of 190 for a couple of hours.
  

  
As I type this I&rsquo;ve been dieting lightly for almost a week and I&rsquo;m down to 181 lbs, just under the 181.9 lb limit in the 82.5 kg class. I made it! I also just deadlifted a little over 500 lbs a few hours ago in my last heavy session before meet day. 

Looks like I&rsquo;m on track to squat 440 and pull a little over 500 in my weight class which you&rsquo;ll notice is almost 20 lbs shy of my adult male size. And I&rsquo;m&#8230;OK with that!
  

  
I&rsquo;ll get back on track right after the meet. In fact, I&rsquo;ll probably be 200 lbs before spring has fully sprung&#8230;though I fully intend to compete a little under that in the 90 kg/198 lb class in the USAPL Raw Nationals. I also plan to be an awful lot stronger by then too.
  

  
So forgive me for not being fully grown just yet. It will come. I hope you will enjoy my posts anyway as I get there.
