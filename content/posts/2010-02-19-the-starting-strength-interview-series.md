_**PR Friday:** Post weights lifted, gained, or eaten as well as pants ripped, girls lifted, and children tossed._
  

  
Some of you may [remember][1] me mentioning that Rip will be interviewing some interesting people to put on his [Starting Strength][2] website. There are two interviews uploaded &#8212; one with [Shane Hamman][3], and another special edition with [Eva Twardokens][4].

Shane and Eva are two-time Olympians &#8212; Shane competed in weightlifting in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and Eva competed in downhill skiing in the winter Olympics in 1992 and 1994. Each interview focuses on the athlete&rsquo;s particular sport, and Eva&rsquo;s is quite useful since we are in the middle of the winter Olympics. Both interviews are conducted in a unique way that is not a monotonous, irritating question/answer session aimed at finding out how the interviewee &#8220;feels&#8221;. Take a gander and see how you like them.
  

  
I have never had the pleasure of meeting Shane, but Eva is a friend of mine, a sweetheart, a fiery competitor, and pretty damn strong. Nevertheless, she still succumbed to being pressed overhead&#8230;by me.
