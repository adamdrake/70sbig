## &#8220;Quotes&#8221;

We just had a Starting Strength Seminar at the WFAC this past weekend. There were some 70&rsquo;s Big readers there, so if they want to talk about how the weekend went, they can do so in the comments or send an e-mail that I can post. They all lifted well and there should be some good pictures&#8230;eventually.
  

  
In the mean time, here is a sweet video of AC squatting 495 for a triple &#8212; but the good part is at the very end. Oh, and if you assholes start sending videos or pictures, then I don&rsquo;t have to keep posting videos of us (some of you have, and they are in line.
