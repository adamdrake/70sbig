The internet is still a funny place. You never can be too careful with who you believe, especially if that person does not have an identity outside of their internet persona. Being an internet skeptic can probably be taken too far and is even analogous (arguably) to Robespierre in the French Revolution.

In any case, there is still some goofy talk around [the net][1] that include accusatory false statements or records pertaining to the improvement my friend Zach in his time at the WFAC. I am not involved in the discussion, but it does have something to do with me since I originally taught Zach the lifts, coach him on his form and program on a regular basis, and encourage him to continue growing. Basically what I am saying is that I don&rsquo;t think contrary arguments are malicious, but I and we are not fucking around, and if someone with average genetics wants be a good deal stronger and bigger, this is what we do.
  

  
Here are some videos of Zach &#8212; he weighs himself, then he does his volume squat workout, which is 5&#215;5 at 320. Every rep is to full depth, and the sets are not that hard; Rip&rsquo;s main priority is keeping him out of his knees. Oh, and there are two videos in order to represent the two cameras used to show different angles, in case his depth was in question.
