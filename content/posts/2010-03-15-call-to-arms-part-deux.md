**Note: You will find Monday&rsquo;s post below &#8212; this is just a side post because I did not want to take away from the article posted.**
  

  
Ladies and gentlemen who are on your quest to 70&rsquo;s Bigdom, I am excited (physically or emotionally, I can&rsquo;t tell) to announce the advent of the **70&rsquo;s Big Workshop**.
  

  
This interactive lecture style formatted workshop will include material that teaches a coach or trainee how to get 70&rsquo;s Big along with a butt load of training material that you can only obtain from a knowledgeable coach or through years of experience &#8212; in other words, the little things that make a big difference in your training.
  

  
While we could host the first workshop at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club, I figured I would make it more accessible to Dallas/Fort Worth by coming to the area. However, this requires a willing gym, hence this message. If you own or are part of a gym in the DFW area and are interested in hosting this brand new workshop, [e-mail me][1] (there is something in it for the gym owner).
  

  
Also: yes I am interested in other areas within driving distance of Wichita Falls &#8212; east, west, and south Texas, Oklahoma, etc.

_For those of you asking about shirts, they will be going to print within the next 10 days._
