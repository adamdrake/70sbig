Paul&rsquo;s wife had a baby. This baby&rsquo;s name is Gabe, and he lost 13% of his bodyweight due to jaundice (I had jaundice when I was a newborn too). After that, he gained 3 lbs. 4.5 oz in 18 days, which is a growth rate of 2.9 oz/day. The average baby will grow 1 oz/day in the third and fourth weeks of life. In other words, Gabe is already gettin&rsquo; 70&rsquo;s Big and makin&rsquo; daddy proud.

I am long over-due with this, but my friend Mike Hom pulled 505&#215;5 at a body weight of 185. I am trying to talk him into growing into the 94 kg class, and he is doing a decent job at it.
