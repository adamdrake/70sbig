## &#8220;Today is Evaluation Day. The key word being value. Do you have any? Not yet you don&#8217;t&#8221;

Well, there are lots of things to announce on this [fribbling][1] Friday, so let&#8217;s get on with the bloody thing.
  

  
**1. New T-shirt&#8230;BAM!**
  

  
[<img data-attachment-id="1467" data-permalink="/blog/2010/03/bam/logo-shirt-2/" data-orig-file="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2.png" data-orig-size="1200,1163" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="logo-shirt-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2-400x387.png" data-large-file="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2-1024x992.png" src="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2-400x387.png" alt="" width="400" height="387" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1467" srcset="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2-400x387.png 400w, /2010/03/logo-shirt-2-1024x992.png 1024w, /2010/03/logo-shirt-2.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />][2]
  

  
The image was dictated to my new pal Al Viquez, who until recently was a graphic designer in the videogame industry. He belted out a draft, and it was damn near perfect. A few adjustments later and we have this sweet, succulent image that bleeds 70&#8217;s Big. The t-shirt will be going to print in a day or so. There are also four other t-shirts that will be announced soon.

**2. WFAC Training Camp**
  
We still have some spots open for the group training package Josh Wells and I are hosting at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club (a shrine of sorts). Coached training sessions include all of the barbell lifts: squat, press, deadlift, bench press, power clean, power snatch, snatch, and clean and jerk (along with assistance exercises). For more information, go [here][3] or [e-mail me][4].
  

  
**3. PR Friday**
  
Post your weights lifted, consumed, or gained to the comments. We also like silly stories about lifting spouses, tossing children, and ripping clothing.
  

  
**4. Online Programming**
  
70&#8217;s Big will now be offering online programming to monitor your training regime and gear it towards whatever your goals are. Do you train on your own and don&#8217;t know what to do when your deadlift peters out while your squat rages on? Are you trying to figure out a way to include some conditioning for your rugby season, judo match, mountain bike race, football season, deployment date, etc. into your strength program? Need the advice of experienced coaches? All of those shenanigans and more with a month-to-month subscription of help for under $100. Oh, and form checks are inherent to make sure you are doing the program properly.Shoot me an e-mail</a> to learn more, and stay tuned for further information on the site.
