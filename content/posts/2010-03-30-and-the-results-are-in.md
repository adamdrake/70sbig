Yesterday&#8217;s polls will, at the very least, make good conversation material. I don&#8217;t necessarily know if the polls are a good indicator of the entire readership on 70&#8217;s Big, but they are at least a glimpse. We have to make a lot of assumptions in order to generalize; did I word the questions properly (probably not), did you interpret them correctly (unlikely), did you answer them truthfully (erroneous), and if the sample size is indicative of the entire readership (who knows?).
  

  
In any case, there are some telling results.
  

  
**70&#8217;s Big Is A Sausage Party**
  
I blame this on all of you. I try to reach out to females, really, I do. I do it at the gym too, but the truth is, there aren&#8217;t going to be a lot of girls coming into the WFAC, and not a lot of girls are going to accidentally coming across 70&#8217;s Big either.
  

  
I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t prefer sausage parties. It&#8217;s not a homophobic thing, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;d prefer to have some gals hanging out too. This means that you, the guy who is more likely to be reading this, must chat to your girlfriend, your wife, your lady friends, your cleaning lady &#8212; whatever &#8212; about strength training. My main goal isn&#8217;t to get more females reading the site; I just want more of them to get stronger. Everyone likes progress, and this means more strong. It also means a nice lookin&#8217; butt, and this is a win-win for everyone. So, either you have to talk to them about strength training, or send them to someone who can teach them, because letting anyone grow up thinking that 30 minutes on the elliptical is going to yield sexiness and longevity is gonna be bad news bears for everyone.
  

  
**We Are Mostly Young People**
  
I consider someone in their thirties young. They think they are old. I don&#8217;t really think thirty-something is old, because I sure as hell am not going to think my life is nearing its end when I&#8217;m thirty. My friend Scott in Washington state is in his forties, and he is probably the most enthusiastic guy on a quest to 70&#8217;s Bigdom. In any case, a lot of us are young. We have the potential to influence a generation of popular culture that has taught the country that [emaciated][1] is not only okay, but what is desirable. And this is what we&#8217;re up against, my friends.
  

  
Gant just sent me a picture of someone in the airport, a poor guy wearing skinny jeans. Gant was most displeased with this display of societal influence (except he said something about a person like that should get gender reassignment therapy), and I&#8217;m upset that a guy thinks that being obscenely skinny is okay. I&#8217;m not saying that everyone is going to weigh 225, but men don&#8217;t weigh 150 pounds. Period.
  

  
**But 70&#8217;s Big Readers Need To Grow**
  
Half of the dudes who voted on their weight are less than 200 pounds. It&#8217;s not like people who read 70&#8217;s Big are all 5&#8217;6&#8243; or shorter, so this needs to be addressed. I want you all stronger. If you are going to really achieve some potential in strength, you will need to gain some muscular bodyweight. Jeez, you guys who are less than 200 pounds seem like you&#8217;re mad at me for wanting to help you get strong.
  

  
Adult Males > 200 lbs.
  

  
**Someone Did Something Wrong**
  
Either you guys didn&#8217;t know how to train until recently, or your training sucked. If you have been training for at least one year, and you weigh less than 200 pounds, then something is fucked (females, the few of you are excluded from this comment). Get your muscular bodyweight up, and then address your bodyfat if you want. But if you&#8217;re one of these guys running around the internet claiming that gaining a little bit of fat with a lot of muscle is bad, then you&#8217;re just as much a goober as the stooges that say you should never wear a belt. Do a proper program while eating like we tell you and you will grow into a muscular behemoth.
  

  
**Most Of You Are At Least Sorta Serious**
  
The majority of voters have a tangible training log. This is good. The internet won&#8217;t always be available, especially when the zombie outbreak occurs. The few of you that don&#8217;t have a training log aren&#8217;t training, you&#8217;re fucking around. Decide if you want to get stronger. Decide if you want to be muscular. Females, decide if you want to get stronger. Decide if you want a nice butt. Barbell training and food can give it to you.
