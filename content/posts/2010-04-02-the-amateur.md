## &#8220;Mmmm&#8230;you smell like outside!&#8221;

Dang, some of you are too gullible. In fact, did you know gullible is not even in the dictionary? Look it up if you don&#8217;t believe me.
  

  
In any case, it&#8217;s PR Friday. Post your weight lifted, consumed, or gained, and also post all of the temperamental moments you had when someone pulled an April Fool&#8217;s joke on you.

My friend [Spencer Hall][1] from SB Nation is known as &#8220;The Amateur&#8221;, the guy who can&#8217;t do anything as good as those who can. Well, recently he shot up to Charlotte to witness his first powerlifting meet. This was the &#8220;Battle of the Border&#8221; meet that AC competed in a few weekends ago. Spencer [wrote an article][2] for the SB Nation readers who are more than likely not familiar with powerlifting. He highlights AC quite a bit, and there&#8217;s a pretty funny video at the end. Even if he didn&#8217;t talk about my pal Ace, I still would enjoy this article &#8212; Spencer had me laughing my ass off. For example:

> Unfortunately&#8230;a mustache _[that Spencer is wearing_] brands you as:
  
> 
  
> a.) A gregarious pedophile
  
> 
  
> b.) A new expat from the Middle East
  
> 
  
> c.) A misplaced fisherman
  
> 
  
> d.) Nick Offerman, also known as Ron Swanson on NBC&#8217;s hit sitcom Parks and Recreation 

And here is an exchange between Spencer and AC:

> I ask him how much his hair is worth on a lift.
  
> 
  
> &#8220;The hair? Oh, that&#8217;s ten pounds, easy.&#8221;
  
> 
  
> &#8220;The beard is five, right?&#8221;
  
> 
  
> &#8220;Definitely. And you have to wear the singlet. This one is my dad&#8217;s. His balls were in this singlet.&#8221;
  
> 
  
> He wears a look of pride on his face as he says this.
  
> 
  
> &#8220;Singlets are cool. Don&#8217;t let anyone tell you otherwise.&#8221;

The article is very fucking funny, and Spencer has a nice little description of an outsider&#8217;s view of a powerlifting meet. We&#8217;ll probably hear from him again in the future.
