My friends Ryan and Heidi at Amarillo Strength and Conditioning hosted their first powerlifting meet back on March 13th. If I recall correctly, they were looking to get the event sanctioned, but by doing so it would have delayed the date. They just wanted to have a competition, and they weren&#8217;t worried about it being officially official, at least this first time out.
  

  
They had 20 people participate and [Neil Eddins][1], who holds some national Masters powerlifting [records][2] in NASA, stopped by to help out. The meet went well, and they had a lot of their lifters set PR&#8217;s, and they raised some money for the Rockwell Road Baptist Church Children&#8217;s Ministry.
  

  
I commend the Amarillo SC crew for having this meet for a few reasons. First, it got a lot of their lifters to lift in a meet environment. This is good for the lifter and coach, and everyone learns from doing it. The lifter learns all that [stuff][3] about themselves, the coach learns all kinds of stuff about handling lifters at the meet, and then the meet director learns about running a meet &#8212; all important things to learn if you&#8217;re going to be involved in this kind of stuff. Some of you may be thinking, &#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t sanctioned, so it doesn&#8217;t count, so what&#8217;s the point?&#8221; I think it&#8217;s good that they ran a meet once before they did it for real. This way they won&#8217;t screw up the official one, they&#8217;ll have the experience, and they will be ready for it. It was also a nice, harmless way to introduce their lifters into competition since they didn&#8217;t have to travel away from their own gym, and probably didn&#8217;t have to pay a bunch of money for something that they hadn&#8217;t done before.
  

  
In any case, everything went well, according to Ryan when we talked about it. I&#8217;ve never been to Amarillo SC, but Ryan frequents the comments and always has good things to say about their lifters. I will be visiting [Amarillo SC][4] on April 24th for the first **70&#8217;s Big Workshop** (more on this tomorrow). Below are the top finishers in the two weight classes per gender (they had light and heavy weights) as well as a video compilation (Ryan apologizes for some sideways shots, it was his first video &#8212; oh and the high squats were red lighted, so don&#8217;t worry about bitching about them).
