Look, I know a lot of you are training out of CrossFit facilities. There ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; wrong with that. But, most people wanting to get better at doing CrossFit stuff will do so by getting stronger. This isn&#8217;t new, we&#8217;ve been saying it for a while. It may not be in everyone&#8217;s best interest to weigh 260+ and be a lifter. That is okay, although the lot of you guys reading the site are horrendously underweight, regardless if you compete in anything or not.
  

  
My friend Gant moved up a weight class in Judo (from 90kg to 100kg) and has won his last two tournaments. The point is that he maintains a bodyweight below 220, but still has the 70&#8217;s Big mindset. He strength trains properly and conditions very well for his sport. Oh, and he also eats like a man should: heartily. Actually being big enough to be considered 70&#8217;s Big will not be in everyone&#8217;s best interest, but the quest of 70&#8217;s Big is one that aims to get stronger and improve.
  

  
&#8220;The Scott&#8221; is a good example of this. He&#8217;s a guy who got involved with CrossFit after a period of dicking around in gyms, and then got pretty damn strong by lifting and drinking his milk. Recently he competed in two CrossFit competitions; he weighed 215 for the first, and then 205 for the second. During one of these he was interviewed by a camera crew, and they asked him a series of questions. When they finally asked about his beard, Scott replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s all about 70s Big, bulking, chocolate milk and lifting heavy.&#8221; Scott is a patriot.
  

  
Oh, for those of you who were upset to see him lose ten pounds, he told me in the e-mail, &#8220;I am glad that I&#8217;m going back to strength training and minimal [conditioning]. This winter my goal is to [weigh] 225 lbs, a 500 deadlift, 450 squat, 400 bench press, 250 press, and 270 clean and jerk.&#8221;
  

  
In any case, Scott is a guy who really found his niche by going through CF first. CF can be a gateway to lots of competitive endeavors, yet I still stand by the statement that hardly any people that &#8220;do CrossFit&#8221; put their necks out on the line to actually compete, and this is an integral part to the whole &#8220;70&#8217;s Big thing&#8221;. If you aren&#8217;t interested in powerlifting competitions, or you are unable to get into weightlifting, that is fine. But it is in your best interest to pick something, train for it, and compete in it. You&#8217;ll learn more about yourself than you would by just dicking around and hoping you&#8217;ll get good at something. Figure it out.

70&#8217;s Big TSC
  

  
A lot of you are sacking up and competing in something this month. If you&#8217;re still on the fence, you are <del datetime="2010-04-07T11:56:41+00:00">invited</del> required to participate in the Tactical Strength Challenge this month.
  

  
The events are simple.
  

  
1. Max deadlift. You get three attempts to find your max pull. Do it meet-style. If you make an &#8220;AC-jump&#8221; between your first and second attempt, there is no going back.
  

  
2. Max pullups. Dead hangs. No chinning (palms must face away), and absolutely no kipping. Kippers will be shot, killed, and then banned from posting here.
  

  
3. 5 min Kettlebell snatch test. 24kg kettlebell. Unlike GS, you may set the weight down or switch hands as necessary.
  

  
That&#8217;s it, three events. Perform these in one session, and rest at least 15 minutes between each even (or more if you have time). Perform the TSC the last week of April and post your results on the last Saturday of April (I&#8217;ll make a weekend post for it). Good luck!

_Edit: After posting this part this morning, I got an email from [Kettlebell Athletics][2] about the kettlebell snatch. Jason is a good dude, and he puts out a nice newsletter. Today&#8217;s topic is how not to bang your wrist while doing KB snatches, a big problem with beginners. If you&#8217;re new to this exercise, check out this video and practice your technique before doing the TSC. I also recommend wearing wrist bands the first few times out.
