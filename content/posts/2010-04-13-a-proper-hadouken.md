**&#8220;Get a tan, buddy!&#8221;**
  

  
You won&#8217;t find the above quote in any book, movie, or TV show (or if you can, it isn&#8217;t what I&#8217;m referring to). I was walking with my lady friend with my shirt off on Sunday, and this _extremely_ cool guy shouted it from his car as he was driving by. It took me a moment to realize what he said, but I glanced over and I&#8217;m 74% sure that he was wearing a wife beater and was thoroughly tanned. I, on the other hand, was thoroughly white and hairy.
  

  
What&#8217;s really important here is that I&#8217;m sure he was thoroughly satisfied at what he had done, and he did this at my expense (it was more than likely the most satisfying experience of his day). Such is the story of my life. I aim to satisfy (from an intellectual and entertainment perspective, you pervert) the readers of this site at my own expense. I just hope you&#8217;re getting your [satisfaction][1]. If you aren&#8217;t, maybe you can mosey on over to the [70&#8217;s Big Store][2] because the new 70&#8217;s Big Throwback T-shirt is now available for purchase.
  

  
An excerpt:
  
Twisted steel and sex appeal are rampant with this vintage shirt that is a head on collision between the style of old and new. The strong guy on the front says, “Yeah, I barbell train,” and his better half says, “Yeah, squatting gives me a solid ass.” This shirt is guaranteed to turn some heads, and those heads will say, “Yeah, that guy (gal) is ready to party.”

Supplies are limited with the first printing because&#8230;uh, I don&#8217;t have a lot of money. I will more than likely have to make a new order in the next day or so. Also, let it be known that this is a new method of shipping the shirts, and there will undoubtedly be some kinks to work out. If you have any questions or concerns, go to the [Store][2] page and post to the comments. We&#8217;ll get to them ASAP.
  

  
There will be updates for other services and the store starting in the morning and throughout the day.
