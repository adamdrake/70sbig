If you live in the west Texas area, the first 70&#8217;s Big Workshop will be in Amarillo this coming Saturday (April 24th) at 9:00 AM (time subject to change if the participants at Amarillo SC want it any later). There is a good group of people from [Amarillo Strength and Conditioning][1] that are signed up, but non-gym members are welcome as well.
  

  
Topics will include:

  * What is 70&#8217;s Big? &#8212; Strength, anti-emaciation, competition, education, etc.
  * The effect of strength on other physical attributes
  * How to start or continue training in a smart, efficient manner
  * Dispelling training myths
  * Points of emphasis for different populations (male/female, small/medium/large)
  * Dealing with injuries and setbacks
  * Programming guidelines
  * Routines, Rituals, and Training Quirks
  * Food plans

Much like a physiological system, this workshop is adaptable to the questions and needs of the participants in the audience. The interactive workshop will last for 4 to 5 hours and you can register <a href="http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07e2txzequf7efd84c" target="_blank">here</a> for $85.
  

  
Post any questions you may have to the comments.
