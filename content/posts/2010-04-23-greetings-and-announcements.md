&#8216;Tis PR Friday lads and lasses, and that means you get to post your personal records in lifting, clothing ripped, eating, and bodyweight increases. I just saw someone ferociously rip their shorts when they were squatting yesterday. It brought a tear to my eye.
  

  
Oh, and the [70&#8217;s Big Twitter page][1] was just launched. We&#8217;ll try to make it funny.

**Greetings!**
  
We&#8217;ve been shipping out the t-shirt orders and there have been a bunch of orders from around the world; Ireland, the UK, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, and Australia all contain people who are on the quest to 70&#8217;s Big. I&#8217;d like to personally extend a greeting to all of the international readers and welcome you all to post in the comments this weekend to drop us a line. I&#8217;ve never been out of the U.S., so this is particularly fascinating to be reaching anybody across the world.

**The Mustaches of May Contest**
  
Starting in May 70&#8217;s Big will have a picture contest centered around a particular theme every month. Whoever has the best picture in May will win a 70&#8217;s Big t-shirt. The theme of May&#8217;s contest is mustaches, so the submitter must include a picture of them wearing some kind of stellar &#8216;stache. This is open to both males and females, but females are strongly encouraged to not grow a mustache for this event. The mustache doesn&#8217;t have to be real, but you&#8217;d have to think of something pretty damn clever to win on a fake &#8216;stache.
  

  
Some rules off the top of my head include:
  
&#8211; No male nudity. Ever.
  
&#8211; Female nudity won&#8217;t be posted on the site.
  
&#8211; Don&#8217;t send me something that is going to piss people off (racial or violent stuff), and if you are doing something religious, it shouldn&#8217;t mock the religion but pay homage to it.
  

  
Ultimately, just use good sense. Don&#8217;t ruin this for everyone else.
