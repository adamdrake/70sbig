I got to the gym late today, so I didn&#8217;t realize Justin was out. Sorry.
  
</br>
  
Thanks to all who participated in the TSC. Thanks to Antigen for compiling [results][1].
  
</br>
  
It was a good first outing. I&#8217;m pleased to report that all the guys pulled at least three wheels and most weighed in >200 (JasonR didn&#8217;t but kicked almost everyone&#8217;s ass anyway).
  
</br>
  
A special shout-out to the three ladies who competed. They deadlifted 225, 275, and 305, with Heidi adding 13 pullups and 100 snatches. Solid, solid performance.
  
</br>
  
This month is going to be the Total 225 Challenge. The format is simple:
  
* Squat 225 for max reps
  
* Bench 225 for max reps
  
* Deadlift 225 for max reps
  
</br>
  
Squats are full depth (crease of hip below top of knee). Bench presses must touch the chest then be locked out at the top. DLs should be done with iron if possible. You can touch and go, but NO BOUNCING (that&#8217;s you, crossfitters). DL stops when you let go of the bar or take more than 3 seconds between attempts. No straps.
  
</br>
  
This can be scaled if necessary. Women can do, I don&#8217;t know, 135? (Somebody suggest something here).
  
</br>
  
Males-in-training can do 185. But really, you need to get at least one damn rep with 2 plates per. It is your destiny.
  
</br>
  
Here is your inspiration:
