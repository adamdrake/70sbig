Patrik, from Northern Sweden, e-mailed me yesterday to let me know that the European Powerlifting Championships are being broadcast live for our entertainment. From his e-mail:

> Greetings from the North of Sweden and SAK (home of benching legends Fredrik Svensson and Marcus Hirvonen)!
  
> You can view the European Powerlifting Championchips LIVE on the net! Just thought id bring it to your attention.
  
> 
  
> Check out <http://powerlifting.se/> (its from KÃ¶ping, in Sweden).
  
> 
  
> This day was filled with some of the most awesome lifts I have seen. Mia from Sweden did 145 kilos in the deadlift and 142.5 in the squat on a bodyweight of 46kilos!

> You can find the schedule on <http://www.powerlifting.se/schedule.htm> 
  
> The whole thing is broadcasted live on <mms://stream.bowlstream.tv/stream1>
  
> 
  
> It should play fine in VLC media player or Media Player Classic, some people seem to have trouble with the live stream in Windows Media Player though.

> BTW, our small town Sundsvall has more elite-benchers in the making. Christoffer Ahlman just took a new Swedish record, benching 203 kilos at a bodyweight of 74 kilos (competing in the 75 kilo class)

> These are IPF approved lifts, so only 1 ply shirts&#8230; :)

Note that Sweden is 7 hours ahead of Central Standard Time, therefore they are 6 hours ahead of EST.** 
  
Here is the lift Patrik mentions above:
