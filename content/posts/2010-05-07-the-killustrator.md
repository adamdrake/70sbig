**PR Friday**
  
Ladies, non-ladies who need to gain weight, and adult males&#8230;it is PR Friday. Surely you have achieved something great this past week. Surely you have something notable to tell us about. The good news is that we want to hear about it. Detail your triumphs, or your PR follies, in the comments of today&#8217;s post. It will be entertainment for all.

I&#8217;d like to share a brand new website with you, 70&#8217;s Big readers. [Killustrated.com][2] is a website where you can purchase graphic products (posters, shirts, illustrations, etc.) that range from cool lifting shirts, amazing pieces of lifting art, and fantastic anatomical drawings. Whether you are outfitting your home gym, looking for new lifting t-shirts, want some funky art, or are preparing to give lectures in the realm of exercise and/or training, Killustrated is stocked for your needs.
  

  
Killustrated is run by [The Killustrator][3] is &#8220;reclusive and eccentric fellow. A moderately accomplished athlete, coach, and art school dropout, he has spent more than two decades researching and teaching anatomy & physiology in a variety of formats.&#8221; He knows his stuff, and can portray it very well artistically; a deadly combination.
  

  
One piece that I want to highlight is the [Pisarenko Poster][4]. Anatoly Pisarenko is one of our 70&#8217;s Big co-captains, and the Killustrator has brought out the drama in this classic Bruce Klemens photo of Pisarenko.

This poster is &#8220;17&#215;22 inch hand numbered giclee print on archival quality matte media&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know what the hell that means, but the texture of this &#8220;poster&#8221; is as thick as a note card, and it has some type of finish on the ink. In other words, it is built to last and is some high quality stuff. I know, because I have one &#8212; I have #5 out of 1,000. There will only be 1,000 printings, and after that, they will NOT be reprinted, so if you want one, you better get it now.
  

  
When the Killustrator showed me the poster, I couldn&#8217;t stop staring at it. It is absolutely beautiful. I&#8217;m framing mine and will use it for training motivation.
