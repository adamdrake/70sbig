## &#8220;Great day to be alive!

## Some &#8220;Must Reads&#8221;

70&#8217;s Big is a fun little resource for a variety of things, but it isn&#8217;t the only lifting site out there. I want to play the part of &#8220;RSS for Strength&#8221; to highlight a few articles that we&#8217;ve enjoyed lately. This should keep you distracted on this glorious Monday.
  
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-
  

  
The first article is something that all of you novices need to pay attention to (this also includes everybody that weighs under 200 pounds).
  
From [StartingStrength.com][1]: [YNDTP][2] by Mark Rippetoe

> The idea is that you must gain some bodyfat in the process ifyour bodyfat is low, and that you should lose some bodyfat if it is high. I don’t want you fat, but Idon’t care about seeing your abs. If you want to see your abs, fine – worry about that later. I want youto get big by getting stronger, and to do this it may be necessary for your bodyfat percentage to go upin the process. Later, if necessary, the process of losing it can be more easily accomplished when youhave more muscle mass. But right now, just worry about getting _strong_, and _big_ will be a side-effect, aswill improved body composition. And if you don’t stop misinterpreting this, I will have you all killed.

This website is obviously focused on basing a training (or even exercise) program around the development of strength. _[Tree More Reasons Why I Hate &#8220;Fitness&#8221;][3]_ by Jason Nunn on [Elite Fitness Systems][4] has a similar mindset, and the dude is peeved with the fitness industry.

> If you do a Google search for “certified personal trainer,” you’ll find that there are approximately 5,342 personal trainer certifications. Hiring a personal trainer can work great for people who need the accountability and guidance, but I wouldn’t advise hiring a trainer just based on the fact that they’re “certified.” A personal trainer certification is the fitness equivalent of a CPR certification. Just because an individual is CPR certified doesn’t mean they’re a paramedic. The same holds true for trainers. Just because he’s certified doesn’t make him an expert.

One of the best tools you can do for all around conditioning, _especially_ for a strength athlete, is push a [prowler sled][5] (read what we had to say about it [here][6]). However, you may not always have a prowler on hand, or you may be a travelin&#8217; man.
  
[_Treadmill Pushing: The Solution to the Prowler-less Gym_][7] by Keir Wehham-Flatt on [Elite Fitness Systems][4].

> &#8230;as a freelance trainer working with clients at more than one facility, I often find that time, space, and equipment constraints preclude the use of sled pushing with my clients. I have found treadmill pushing to be a great substitute for sled work on such occasions and have implemented it in my programs over the past year with success.

Oh, and [send in][8] your mustache pics for the May Picture Submission Contest if you want to get in the running for a free 70&#8217;s Big shirt. Looks like Tom is gonna win.
