Meet Brian Drescher, a living legend. I stumbled upon YouTube videos of this guy and was pretty entertained. Unfortunately the guy who uploaded his two best videos put a block on embedding them, so you will have to click them manually.
  

  
This guy apparently loves him some Olympic weightlifting. When he hits his lifts, he&#8217;ll say things like, &#8220;In your face! There it is! Still the king!&#8221; so fast you wonder how he was prepared to say it while supporting 100 kilos overhead. The guy must be crazy like [Ricky Bruch][1], but generally has a jovial disposition (as opposed to Bruch&#8217;s ill-tempered nature).
  

  
The first video I saw was this one at the 2007 Empire State Games, and it gives you a splash of his personality.
  
For whatever reason, the YouTube account doesn&#8217;t allow links to the videos. You can find the account [here][2], and it is the 2007 Empire State Games video.
  

  
But you&#8217;ll learn so much more from him in [this next vid][3] (my personal favorite) &#8212; he spits out his life philosophy while doing a set of 10 power snatches at 70 kilos (note the &#8220;Got Total?&#8221; shirt).
  

  
Don&#8217;t fret, we also have videos of him competing in the 2008 and 2009 Empire State Games. This is a real treat folks, because he is, after all, an American legend.
