Look, I really don&#8217;t have anything to post. I have lots of medium length posts that I have to write, lots of lifters to induct into the hall of fame, lots of Olympic lifting to cover, lots of people to feature, but none of that is a quick write up, and none of it is happening tonight (Sunday night). You&#8217;ll always get my honesty.
  

  
We had a small group at the 70&#8217;s Big Workshop in Allen, Texas. I&#8217;ve mentioned that the workshop will adapt to the crowd, and this one shifted into the benefits of strength training and ways to incorporate it into training programs. If you want to host a workshop, [e-mail me][1].
  

  
On a similar note, Chris graduated from college this past weekend. We had a little shindig and congratted him. To celebrate, here is the following video.

So, somebody strike up an interesting conversation in the comments. You guys are always welcome to send me links to stuff that you consider 70&#8217;s Big (it makes for entertaining posts, like [last Friday&#8217;s][2]), send in photos (although sometimes they don&#8217;t make it on the site), or send in videos. Maybe somebody will come up with something good. Happy Monday.
