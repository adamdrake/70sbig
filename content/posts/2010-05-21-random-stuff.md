## **PR Friday**

Weight lifted, food eaten, children tossed, etc.
  
I expect the female participation to continue. Damn it.
  

  
Oh, and **next week is the last week to get mustaches pics in.** I&#8217;m gonna post some over the weekend.

An e-mail from Micah, who just experienced his last day of high school:

> Well Justin,
  
> Right now i am on the path to being 70sbig. Right now I am 5&#8217;10&#8221; weighing in at 215. But anyways today was my last day of high school and at the water day party all i did was overhead press girls and then throw them in pools. Needless to say giggles and numbers ensued, and a lot of questions of why are you so strong? None of the 90&#8217;ssmall 6 packers were able to lift two girls at the same time. Yes being 70s big has many many perks.
  
> Thanks 70sbig.com
  
> Micah

When I e-mailed Micah back asking if he would mind me posting this on the site, he replied with, &#8220;Not at all, Justin. Post that shit up.&#8221;

Here is a video of Colton finishing his linear progression. In August he was 120 pounds. Now he is 175 pounds. His squat went from 95 lbs to 275x5x3. Here is the second set (you can see the other sets on my YouTube page):

Just a tad sloppy, but not too shabby.

Two of my friends from Statesboro, GA. You all know Ace McGonague on the left, and then Taylor is on the right. There are rumors swirling that Taylor aims to weigh 320&#8230;
  
A couple years ago I spotted him on bench when he did 405 for a single (decent bounce, but we are more edumicated now).
