Andy Bolton is still kicking ass, and now he&#8217;s doing it RAWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!111!~\`1\`121J\`3412R8I09SADJLKSDAJF
  

  
Ahem&#8230;Bolton competed at the BPC Push/Pull competition. He benched 280kg/617lbs just because, and then walked out and smoked the piss out of a 432.5kg/953lbs deadlift&#8230;just because.

Well, not &#8220;just because&#8221;, and you can read why [here][1]. 

> I went to this comp not really knowing what i would be able to do,after only 6 deadlift workouts since my knee surgery in november 2009 i went there in my mind would have been happy with 900 thats why i did not use a suit i wanted to hold it back and not get hurt again,so anyway warm ups went well up to 660lb then my opener 770 then to mid 8s after this it felt so so light so i wanted pull more than anybody else out there with no suit and it felt easy

Andy followed that statement up with a challenge for anybody to meet him at the 2011 Andy Bolton Deadlift Challenge, if the challengers were &#8220;up to it&#8221;. I wonder if Konstantinovs will be there? He has pulled 939 raw, although it was much more difficult than Bolton (and that was about a year ago):
