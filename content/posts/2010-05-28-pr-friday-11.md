**PR Friday**
  
Post your weight lifted, gained, and number of females that you know who can toss &#8220;men&#8221; around.

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-
  

  
We like 70&#8217;s Big readers to get strong. Then we like 70&#8217;s Big readers to compete. In something. Well, the Highland Games is an option. Gant competed at one last year, and he&#8217;s getting ready to do another this year.
  

  
Gant is primarily a judo player these days, but has competed in a lot of stuff (I don&#8217;t know, ask him). I have videos of him squatting and pressing from this past week (he&#8217;s on the 5/3/1 program) as well as a video of him throwing a shot in preparation of the Highland Games competition he&#8217;ll be doing. Make the comparison between his squat, press, and put and report back to us whether you think the strength movements are going to help his throwing or not.
  

  
You&#8217;ll notice Gant is squatting with a shim under his left foot. He&#8217;s got some pelvic problems that require constant adjustment. When squatting on a shim, the imbalance makes it easy for the lifter to drift onto their toes, and you&#8217;ll see that a bit here. Oh, and after talking, Gant and I are of the opinion that these squats do look high, but also of the opinion that lots of squats on video look high. He&#8217;s a little high on a few, and that&#8217;s why I try to yell about it.

Funky left elbow/shoulder thing on the last rep of the presses. You&#8217;ll see Gant&#8217;s displeasure. I also don&#8217;t recommend trying to coach and film at the same time. I like my unnecessary &#8220;speed&#8221; cue in the middle (it&#8217;s a good cue if the lifter is doing touch and go, but he wasn&#8217;t, and I guess I blurted it out).

Putting it to practice throwing the shot. Oh, and yes, Gant realizes he won&#8217;t be throwing a shot in the Highland Games.

Note: I&#8217;ll do something about the narrow width of the site later (I don&#8217;t know how to do it myself).
