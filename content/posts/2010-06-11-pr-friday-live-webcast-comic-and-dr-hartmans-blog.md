**PR Friday** boys and girls. Post this week&#8217;s PRs to the comments; weight lifted, eaten, or gained, pants ripped, children punted, trees kicked, villages pillaged, and ladies training &#8212; they&#8217;re all PRs.

The **USA Weightlifting Senior National Championships** is going on this weekend in Peoria, Illinois. You can watch a live webcast of the lifting on Saturday and Sunday by clicking the following link:

**Get Your Knowledge On**
  
Here is [the blog][2] of Dr. Hartman. I&#8217;ll let this quote describe him:

> Dr. Michael Hartman is a Sport Scientist, and recognized expert in training for Strength-Power and Performance. He earned his Doctorate in Muscle Physiology and has previously worked as a Collegiate Strength and Conditioning Coach and Sport Scientist at the US Olympic Training Center where he was a member of the inaugural USA Weightlifting Performance Enhancement Team. 

Dr. Hartman is also friends with Dr. Kilgore (who some of you may be familiar with), and I&#8217;ve also heard that he is a very good strategist as a platform coach (this means while he handles lifters at meets). I met him briefly when he was handling Dr. Kilgore at the USAPL Texas State Meet a couple months ago.
  

  
Anyway, his blog will cover topics of Strength-Power-Performance, Sport Science, general Strength & Conditioning, as well as current events in the media. Dr. Hartman&#8217;s research and practical experience should give us a unique perspective on these topics.
