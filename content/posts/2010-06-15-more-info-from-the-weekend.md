I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk about some other things in yesterday&#8217;s post &#8212; my post was long enough and it was getting late. Here is a little list of stuff I wanted to mention.
  

  
**Pronouncing My Name**
  
If anybody saw the webcast, they had all 11 lifters walk out and introduced us one by one. The announcer said &#8220;Justin Las-check&#8221;, and I was right next to the table so I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s Lah-sick.&#8221; He smiled and said they&#8217;d get it figured out in a minute. I guess not. But anyway, it&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;Lah-sick&#8221;. I&#8217;d rather have it said &#8220;Las-check&#8221; than &#8220;Lay-sick&#8221;, though.
  

  
**First Jerk**
  
Using a lower eye gaze definitely made the bar collide into my jaw/chin. When it happened, it almost made me bite a chunk out of my tongue (the back right portion). My tongue was swollen for the rest of the day. I do not recommend this.
  

  
**Crass**
  
I met Rachel briefly. She was wandering around looking for something unimportant (I&#8217;m kidding, Rachel). I watched her lift, and I hope I can get as solid a rack position in the snatch as she has sometime soon. I think the new rule is that you aren&#8217;t allowed to ask eating questions until you&#8217;re lifting more than her. Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, Rachel, but you are qualified for the world team with Sunday&#8217;s performance, yes?
  

  
**Problem Areas**
  
My primary problems with the Olympic lifts are technical. I don&#8217;t rack heavy snatches solid and my jerk used to be a mess. I think that getting more experience/practice with the lifts will be the first step into solidifying these things, and I think I&#8217;m on the right path with the cues I have implemented lately. There may be a couple drills that will help the snatch situation. As for the jerk, I recently changed my grip, my elbow position, and how I dip/drive. The dip/drive has been the hardest to reconfigure, but I think I did pretty well with it at the meet, especially on the third attempt (which was the most important). The bar moving back at the rack of the jerk is a new development, and I haven&#8217;t bothered spending time to figure out the mechanics behind it yet.
  

  
**&#8220;The Face&#8221; Is Hard To Do**
  
I think I&#8217;ll need to have a tutorial on how to make &#8212; what I guess is being referred to as &#8212; &#8220;the 70&#8217;s Big face&#8221;. I took a picture with Ben, and it looks like he&#8217;s doing more of a kissy face. Maybe he was trying to spread love to all of his adoring fans.
