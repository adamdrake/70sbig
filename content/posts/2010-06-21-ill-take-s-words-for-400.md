There is a very good possibility that you may find yourself in the twelfth century fighting for your life. In such a (likely) scenario, your only chance of survival would be your manly brawn &#8212; if you&#8217;re a(n adult) man. How else could you fend off your enemies in close combat? You may even acquire a two handed great sword from your fallen foes. Quite the weapon of choice, indeed.
