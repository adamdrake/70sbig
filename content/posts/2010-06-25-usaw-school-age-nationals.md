There will be 287 kids from around the country competing on two platforms. I&#8217;ve never seen an Olympic weightlifting meet run on two platforms (seen it in powerlifting), so it should be non-stop lifting. The best part is that they are running a **live webcast** for both platforms. You can watch it [here][2].
  


Remember when I talked about [Paul Doherty][3] and Hassle Free? Well, they have lots of lifters competing as well as other bay area clubs like, FitBBC, TJ&#8217;s Gym, Catalyst Athletics, California Strength, The Sports Palace and Myles Ahead &#8212; somewhere around 50 lifters from this area alone.
  


I wish I would have been recruited for weightlifting when I was younger (I was pretty good at power cleaning), but we can watch all of these kids that range from 13 to 17. You can see the schedule and qualifying totals for each weight class starting on page five of [this .PDF file][4]. Oh, and here&#8217;s a quick shout out to my pal Kyle &#8212; he&#8217;s 15 years old and qualified for nationals, but won&#8217;t be making the trip to compete. Good stuff nonetheless.

Here&#8217;s a pretty cool video of David Rigert, a 90kg lifter, pressing 203kg in a 1971 competition. That&#8217;s about 446 lbs. boys and girls. You&#8217;ll notice the obvious knee kick, but that&#8217;s how guys pressed because the judges allowed it. The press was eliminated from competition one year later. I always wonder how different weightlifting meets would be if we had to do the clean and press first.
