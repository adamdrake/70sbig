## My Friends Are Stronger and More Funny Than Yours

AC has Heracles-esque strength, and I&#8217;ve known this for a while. This is why I befriended him long ago; so that I could keep him close as a friend in preparation of when he was a foe. Secretly I know that he is my nemesis (don&#8217;t tell AC this), and one day we will battle to the death&#8230;
  

  
But in the mean time we are best friends, and as Brent would say, &#8220;His strength is _ill_.&#8221; He recently pressed 245 for a triple at a body weight of 216. Yeah. I know.
  
_Edit: Sorry for the quality, it&#8217;s a cell phone vid._

AC and Brent were talking about this video (sheeeeeit, everybody is talking about it), and on AC&#8217;s last rep, he yells &#8220;YEAH KENT!&#8221; to the guy holding the camera. I don&#8217;t think this Kent actually &#8220;exists&#8221;, but Brent thought this was pretty cool (I don&#8217;t know why). Being the chivalrous <del datetime="2010-06-28T02:45:20+00:00">nemesis</del> guy that he is, AC said he&#8217;d dedicate his next bench workout to Brent, which was to be 365 for a triple. This pleased Brent, because he is easily pleased by such things, so he decided to dedicate one of his own sets to AC (AKA Ace McGonague). Brent squats 410&#215;5 (he did three sets at this weight) at a body weight around 177.

You&#8217;ll notice my other besties with testies, Chris and Mike spotting Brent in the video (we&#8217;ve come full circle). To complete this roundhouse kick, here is AC&#8217;s final contribution, the video of him squatting 525&#215;2 and benching 365&#215;3 (with a surprise appearance by Taylor, another one of my friends).

So, as you can see, I have proved many points today. I have proved that my friends are stronger than your friends. I have proved that one day, I will destroy Arin W. C\***\*****. I have proved that my friends are more amusing than yours. And I also proved that 70&#8217;s Big is the way of the chainsawed warrior. Need proof?

**QED.**
  

  
On a side note, doesn&#8217;t AC look way more awesome (obligatory no homo because I know I&#8217;d get comments on it) with longer hair? Vote on it, for this is the poll to end all polls.
