My friend Mike Hom (you&#8217;ll remember him from this [video montage][1]) has a goal of deadlifting 405&#215;20. This may be daunting for most lifters, but Hom only weighs 190. But when you remember that he has pulled [505&#215;5][2], it seems reasonable. Well, he&#8217;s almost there.
  
Note the shirt as he pulls 405&#215;16.

That was a PR for Mike, and he wants to get 20 reps by September. If you&#8217;ve got any Personal Records then bust them out in the comments on this glorious PR Friday.

Here is a very cool video of David Rigert mostly preparing for a 210kg clean and jerk (he was a 90kg lifter).
