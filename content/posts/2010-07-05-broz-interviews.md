There&#8217;s a fella named John Broz coaching some serious weightlifting in Las Vegas. He runs [Average Broz Gymnasium][1] &#8212; a small and purposeful weightlifting gym that has the feel of a proper club.
  

  
[Barry Kinsella][2] is an Irish traveler who made his way around America to train with and interview various successful Olympic weightlifting coaches and their lifters. He has made at least two stops to Broz&#8217;s gym, and interviewed him both times. Now, why should you bother watching an interview with John Broz? Well, his favorite weightlifter is 70&#8217;s Big Co-Captain Anatoly Pisarenko and he lived with Antonio Krastev (you know, the guy who still holds the snatch world record of 216kg). Other than that, he coaches Pat Mendes and Rob Adell. Both of them are about 20 years old, and both of them are real fucking strong. Rob won second place in the 94kg category at Junior Nationals, and Pat has become quite the internet sensation with videos showing a 200kg snatch and a 230kg clean and jerk &#8212; phenomenal numbers.
  

  
There is also a lot of controversy (at least on the GoHeavy Forums) about Pat.To get you up to speed, Pat wants to win a gold medal, and probably will. He&#8217;s focused, devoted, and strong as three week old piss. But he wants to earn a living doing it. Pat has dual citizenship in the US as well as Brazil, but USA isn&#8217;t known for supporting its lifters. Thus, Broz and Pat are waiting to see if anyone is willing to pay the young lifter to bring home some gold.
  

  
In any case, Broz has a unique style of programming that he developed from three important coaches he has had in his life (including Krastev). The following videos dive into how he learned from those coaches and what his general training philosophy is. I hope you enjoy them &#8212; Barry is pretty good at gaining insight from his interviews.
  
Here are parts 1 and 2:
