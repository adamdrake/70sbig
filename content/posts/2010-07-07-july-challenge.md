_&#8220;First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.&#8221;_

The bench press numbers were pretty poor in the May Challenge, so we&#8217;re going to work on that. I&#8217;d call for bench again, but I&#8217;m considering your safety. Isn&#8217;t that nice of me?

**Contest: Max sets of 3 press/3 pulls in 20 minutes.**

1 set is 3 reps of 0.625BW press followed by 3 chins or pullups.

So, if you weigh 200 pounds, you will press 125 pounds three times and follow it with three chins or pullups. You cannot start pulling until you&#8217;ve done your triple and vice versa. If you get stuck on 2, TFB. Don&#8217;t move on until your get your third.

Presses are overhead (not military). Pulls can be pullups, chinups, baseball grip, whatever. Just get your chin over the bar. If you have a butt chin that adds another centimeter, that&#8217;s your cross to bear. Pulls are mostly dead hangs. I say mostly because you will start moving your legs after a few minutes. That&#8217;s fine as long as you&#8217;re not swinging. NO KIPPING. We&#8217;re trying to get strong here.

Post results in this thread by the end of the month (July 31 is a Saturday).

PS If you don&#8217;t like it for whatever reason, you can stare at Justin&#8217;s thong all day, which is probably what you&#8217;re doing anyway. Don&#8217;t email me, and don&#8217;t make an ass of yourself in the comments.
