AC has been training with Taylor, a good friend that I used to pal around with when I was still in school. Taylor has pretty impressive pressing strength and bear-like features. I have heard stories of him cuddling a grizzly in its den because he &#8220;needed a soft warm body in those winter months&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t shocked when he told me this.
  

  
A-way is his fiance and is in the top three funniest girls I know. She has surprising ferocity in her miniature stature, especially regarding her bear hug (it helps with Taylor). They are both the feature of another original AC film, and AC makes a deadlifting appearance at the end. Sweet song too.

In early June, Brent hit a PR Snatch at the WFAC in the midst of his powerlifting training.

Here&#8217;s a vid of Chris pulling 600 back in May (I think). He doesn&#8217;t get pumped at all, and that&#8217;s a rarity for him. I thought it was more impressive because he just walks up to the bar and pulls it (trust me, I know what he&#8217;s like when he&#8217;s amped).
