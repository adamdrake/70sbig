Brent&#8217;s persona (personality?) is one that isn&#8217;t impressed by much. I can&#8217;t speak for Brent, but I was impressed by some lifts that occurred at the Junior Worlds in Olympic weightlifting.
  

  
In this video, Abti Aukadov snatches 160kg-165kg-170kg at 85kg. That&#8217;s pretty damn impressive, especially because he&#8217;s 17 years old, but I&#8217;m most impressed by his solid overhead position &#8212; it never wavers. His pulling motion is also very good. I&#8217;m impressed.

A 201kg clean and jerk to follow &#8212; these are huge numbers for a 17 year old. I&#8217;m impressed. I would expect him to make the trip to London in 2012. Kendrick Farris has his work cut out for him &#8212; let&#8217;s hope he keeps improving steadily as well!

The next impressive video is Leidy Solis, a Columbian lifter, clean and jerking 139kg at a 67.4kg body weight. I just want to clarify that 139kg is more than 99% of what you goobers can do (realistically it&#8217;s not that far away from me &#8212; I plan on pulling away though). That is just damn silly. Oh, and she&#8217;s 20 years old. I will have to agree with Brent in liking her intensity as she is coming out of the hole (his words, not mine). I&#8217;m impressed.
