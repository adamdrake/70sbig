## USAPL Raw Nationals

My group of friends that are involved in this website are competing at [USAPL Raw Nationals][1] in Denver this weekend. The five us will be flying there tomorrow from different locations. I&#8217;ll be flying from Panama City, Florida where I recently moved to, AC will be flying out of Georgia (he goes to school at Georgia Southern and his family lives outside of Atlanta, and Chris, Mike and Brent will be flying out of Dallas (Mike and Chris are coming from Wichita Falls and Brent lives north of Dallas). There shouldn&#8217;t be any confusion as to where any of us live now.

Raw lifting in the USAPL is relatively new, and in order to qualify for nationals you simply have to total as a raw lifter in a USAPL meet. USAPL is prevalent for its &#8220;low end gear&#8221; competitions since it resides under the International Powerlifting Federation&#8217;s (IPF) ruling. None of the aforementioned lifters are interested in competing in gear, and it isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;m interested in doing or coaching either. We may look for a new federation in the near future, but as of right now we&#8217;re just focusing on this weekend.
  

  
Belligerent Brent will be competing in the 82.5 kg class and will lift at 9:00 AM on Saturday. He&#8217;s the only one of us that will be lifting on Saturday. I imagine there won&#8217;t be any hi-jinks on Saturday since AC (100kg, 9:00 AM), Mike and Chris (110kg and 125kg, both at 2:00 PM) all lift on Sunday. I&#8217;ll be coaching them in their sessions, and it will be a lot more easy going than the Texas State Meet was ([results][3] and [write up][4]).
  

  
Don&#8217;t fret, though; we&#8217;ll have cameras rolling and AC will be directing. There were some folks that didn&#8217;t know I was in Peoria for USA Weightlifting Senior Nationals and would have come had I mentioned it, so you guys are welcome to attend and cheer them on. All of my friends are young and pretty strong and should do decently at the meet.
  

  
Here is the [Roster][5] and [Schedule][6].
  
I&#8217;ll be posting our progress on the 70&#8217;s Big [Facebook][7] and [Twitter][8] pages.

## New Stuff

And since I&#8217;m announcing things, I&#8217;ll direct your attention to the schedule for the **70&#8217;s Big Workshops** on the [Service][9]s page. AC and I will road trip through California in early August. There are two workshops during the weekend of August 7th near L.A. and Monterey, and we&#8217;ll help out with some coaching while we&#8217;re there. **We don&#8217;t have a workshop scheduled the weekend of the 14th, so if anyone wants to host us we&#8217;ll be in the bay area.** 
  

  
Later in the month we&#8217;ll be in south Florida at Fort Myers, then I&#8217;ll be headed up to western Canada in Kelowna, BC in the last weekend of the month. We&#8217;ll also have some stuff going on in Atlanta as early as September, and I&#8217;ll announce that as soon as we finalize it.
  

  
We&#8217;re also going to start **Live Webcast Presentations** that are pertinent to both Workshop material and reader requests. The audience will be able to ask questions via chat throughout the presentation as well as a Q&A section at the end. It&#8217;s too early to tell if speedos will make an appearance.
  

  
On top of the webcast theme, we&#8217;re going to have **Chat Room Q&A** which will allow users to ask us questions on whatever; training, programming, advice on bullies, how to become a bully, etc. If it gets popular, we&#8217;ll have themes for the chats and perhaps special guests. The **Live Webcast Presentations** and **Chat Room Q&A** will give the readers who live out of driving/sailing distance to interact and get some help.
  

  
Lastly, I&#8217;m going to start doing **Form Check Help**. No, I can&#8217;t coach you without being in person and I may not even be able to make an impact, but I&#8217;ve periodically helped people in all of the barbell lifts by giving them a helpful cue online. You&#8217;ll send in a video, I&#8217;ll analyze it and then we&#8217;ll chat on the phone about it for a bit. If your squat is a fucking train wreck, then I&#8217;m not going to charge you and will try and find you a Starting Strength coach to help you out. These little form checks will be very cheap ($10 and under depending on how many videos) and hopefully it will help those of you that train on your own.
  
Note: You can still send in videos to the site or my e-mail, but I won&#8217;t give it much attention and will only give you a brief response. You won&#8217;t get the whole &#8220;phone call&#8221; and &#8220;descriptive explanation&#8221; thing. Unless I like you.

## PR Friday

Go forth and record your Personal Beasts in the comments throughout the weekend. I hope to hear about your gained weight, lifted weight, children tossed, clothing ripped, and cannonballs performed. I also want to congratulate all the people that have written in and told me about their first lifting competition and how much they enjoyed it. I really like hearing about that stuff &#8212; it makes me proud of you guys&#8230;even if you _are_ a pain in the ass 85% of the time. I&#8217;ll be posting about these exploits soon.
  
Take care and enjoy your weekend.
