Some of you woke up yesterday and were appalled that there wasn&#8217;t a post. I was completely spent after the 12 hours of coaching on Sunday along with being exhausted by interacting with my friends (Gant knows). I constantly was trying to put them in or keep them in a positive state of mind for lifting.
  

  
I&#8217;m not impressed with my coaching from the weekend and think I could have done a better job. I&#8217;m not going to get into it today because I just spent the day traveling from Denver to Panama City, but you can look at some of the updates that I posted from most of the weekend on Twitter.
  

  
Overall, things went pretty well. Brent went 7/9 with PR&#8217;s on all his lifts, AC won second overall in the 220lb Open class, Mike went 7/8 and had big PR&#8217;s on all his lifts as well as winning 5th in the 242lb Open category, and Chris won second overall in the 275lb Junior category. Good, tough lifting out of those four.
  

  
We did a bit of filming throughout the weekend (not as much so that there weren&#8217;t any distractions from Sunday&#8217;s lifting), and AC will be cut together an excellent short film. He&#8217;s already created a sweet teaser:
