I finally was able to train heavy on the Olympic lifts today outside of Atlanta with AC. I brought my bar and bumpers all the way from Panama City, and was itching to train. We had to move to a second facility nearby (thanks Brad, of CF North Fulton), and things went pretty well. This was the first heavy day I&#8217;ve had since nationals, and I was pleased; I snatched 120kg (missed 125 a couple times, technical issue) and clean and jerked 155kg. This was solid because my meet PR&#8217;s are 130/158, so I wasn&#8217;t that far off in my first heavy day in quite a while. I also cleaned 160, but passed out before the jerk (bar went forward, I landed on my back) after telling AC that the only way I wasn&#8217;t going to get it was if I passed out.
  

  
I bring this up because I was in a pretty good training environment. There was loud music, my body was fresh, I was excited to go heavy on the lifts, and AC was there (it&#8217;s always better to train hard with your friends). Since I haven&#8217;t been able to do the Olympic lifts, I&#8217;ve been training heavier on the strength lifts at a military base. I&#8217;m able to get pumped by myself and train hard, so it isn&#8217;t a big deal. But when I trained the Olympic lifts before I moved, it was typically quiet and my friends weren&#8217;t around because of the coaching schedule I had.
  

  
I like to have a more intense atmosphere for the Olympic lifts. They require that maximum exertion be applied on every rep, and, for me, getting some adrenaline going before the lift is helpful. Even more so because I haven&#8217;t done the lifts that much lately. I was too lax at nationals when I was trying to get over excited, and I think it degraded my performance a little bit.
  

  
Anyway, I respond well to like-minded people and music. What do you like when you are lifting? What kind of music? What is your approach? Are you at the stage of thinking, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s not fuck this up,&#8221; or are you all about attacking the bar? Hopefully if you&#8217;re really intense, it&#8217;s warranted with some heavy lifting. Nobody should really be screaming about a 250 squat, unless [you&#8217;re a girl][1].
  

  
Oh, and the 190kg overhead squat by Ben that I promised:
