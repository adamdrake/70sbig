I don&#8217;t have much of a post for you. We traveled to California today, and we&#8217;re tired. AC and I trained last night (got done at midnight), got a couple hours of sleep, then flew to LAX. We&#8217;ll be doing the first 70&#8217;s Big Workshop of the trip on Saturday at [CF Intrepid][1] (on the coast next to Los Angeles, [click here][2] to register).
  

  
Post your PR&#8217;s to the comments. I haven&#8217;t had any PR&#8217;s this week, but it&#8217;s been good to train the Olympic lifts heavy. Here is a video of a 120kg snatch I dedicated to Brent. Shirtless lifting is often done in training halls and Brent and I have joked around about it before, so I felt the need to include him on this session in Georgia.
