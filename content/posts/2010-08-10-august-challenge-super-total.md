The August Challenge is simple. Work up to your heaviest single in the snatch, clean & jerk, squat, bench press, and deadlift. That&#8217;s your total. I say heaviest single because this won&#8217;t be a max. **You can take as many attempts as you need**. Make your jumps and attempts wisely (the smart ones will not take three attempts on every lift).

Here are the rules (because someone will ask):
  
* This must all be done in one session.
  
* Lifts must be done in order.
  
* The snatch and clean and jerk must be caught in a locked-out position. If you press it out, it doesn&#8217;t count.
  
* Yes, it&#8217;s ok if you power snatch or power clean.
  
* Squat must be to depth-crease of hip below top of knee.
  
* Bench does not have to pause on chest. This doesn&#8217;t mean you should dribble the bar off your sternum, though.
  
* The deadlift must be raised without hitching. It must also be lowered to the ground, not dropped above the knee like some dumbass. Your mama raised you better than that.
  
* Sumo is fine. Straps are not.
  
* Belt is mandatory <span style="text-decoration: line-through">unless you&#8217;re a jackass</span> fine. Knee sleeves or light knee wraps are also ok. All other non-injectable gear is disallowed. No bench shirts or squat panties.

Here are two sources of inspiration. The first is a short compilation of the greatness that is Randy White. If there is anything you don&#8217;t like about this video, send me an email with &#8220;ban me&#8221; in the subject and go check your ass into the nearest Curves.

The second video is a tutorial that Juli posted on [Starting Strength][1]. It&#8217;s me telling you how to make the most of your trip to a Mongolian grill. Justin can vouch for the effectiveness of this. You&#8217;ll learn more in this 3-minute clip than you&#8217;ll learn at a CF Level I certification.
