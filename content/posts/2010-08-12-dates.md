I&#8217;m not gonna lie and say I didn&#8217;t drink beer and play Mario all last night. Just deal with the mid-day post.
  

  
We are capping the road trip off Saturday by doing a workshop at CF Centurion. Ian Carver owns the place and he has promised food and beer afterwards. If you&#8217;re within driving distance of the Sacramento area, then it&#8217;ll be well worth it. [E-mail Ian][1] to sign up.
  

   
I will be down in Fort Myers, Florida for a workshop on Saturday August 21st at CF Fort Myers. You can register for that one [HERE][2].
  

  
We&#8217;ll be in Atlanta on the last Saturday of the month (August 28) at AC&#8217;s dad&#8217;s gym, [Body Pros][3] in Alpharetta, GA (north of Atlanta). If you&#8217;re interested in attending this workshop, [e-mail me][4].

I&#8217;m behind on checking e-mails because of this trip and I will get to some of them today. If I haven&#8217;t responded, it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t had the time. I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can.
