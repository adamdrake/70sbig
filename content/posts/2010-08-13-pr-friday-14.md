Justin&#8217;s still on his trip, and I&#8217;ve watched the sunrise from my office desk twice this week, so sorry for the lack of posts. That needn&#8217;t stop you from posting your record exploits this week. Lifting, eating, or pillaging. Let&#8217;s have it.
  

  
Hopefully a lot of you are going to participate in the Super Total Challenge. I&#8217;m doing mine this weekend. Choose your attempts wisely&#8230;maybe two per lift. I suspect that my deadlift will take at least a 60 pound hit by the time I get there.
  

  
Since we&#8217;ve already phoned it in the rest of the week, I&#8217;ll leave you with someone else&#8217;s work. These are a random selection of articles from sites you may not read that contain some good info AKA five bookmarks I can post about in five minutes before getting back to work.
  

  
[Vegetarianism and Veganism Are As Logical As a Poopie-Flavored Lollipop][1]
  

  
This is an article about vegetarians from ChAoS & PAIN. He&#8217;s a smart guy that writes a good training blog. He reminds me of myself when I was younger (goes hard, doesn&#8217;t care for rest, pushes it to the max every damn time), but he&#8217;s a hell of a lot more outspoken.
  

  
[Just Because You Have a Vaginaâ€¦][2] 
  

  
This one is for the ladies or the post-op trannies among us. C&P drops some good knowledge about how women should train.
  

  
[Rebuild Yourself with Complexes][3]
  

  
This is from Dan John, the man who corrected my KB swing before I even got my first one to chest height. It&#8217;s hard to pick out one article from the DJ universe, but I chose this one because it made a significant impact on my training. This spring, I ditched a lot of my old training stuff to get in shape for spring judo. I replaced all of my conditioning (other than mat work) with barbell complexes and prowler work. I got more muscular (from the time under tension), leaner (duh), and in better condition than I have been in a long time. I won the three big spring tourneys in the masters expert division, my best result in years. This article helped me towards that goal.
  

  
[7 minute rotator cuff solution][4]
  

  
A concise prehab and rehab routine for the cuff.
  

  
[DeFranco&#8217;s Agile 8][5]
  

  
The solution to hip mobility problems.
  

  
Of course it wouldn&#8217;t be a 70sBig post if we didn&#8217;t embed a video. Here&#8217;s a typical bowl of meat for me at Genghis Grill. It&#8217;s not a PR, but it&#8217;s a good portion. If your bowl doesn&#8217;t look like this, you need to rethink your strategy.
