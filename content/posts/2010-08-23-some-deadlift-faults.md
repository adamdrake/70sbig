Brent is a pain in the ass, so let&#8217;s pick on him today. Here is a video of him deadlifting 405 for 8. It isn&#8217;t a limit set, but it&#8217;s tough.
  

  
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3_M_Fk8abE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
  

  
On a side note, Brent was asking if he looks more swole in the picture (remember, he&#8217;s been focusing on swollertrophy as of late). I really can&#8217;t tell because he&#8217;s wearing white, the one color that reduces swoleness.
  

  
Irre-fucking-gardlessly, let&#8217;s talk about some mechanics. If you watch the first few reps, you can see that Brent doesn&#8217;t get a good squeeze in his chest prior to pulling. Since he doesn&#8217;t extend his thoracic spine to the potential that he can, there is some slack that gets yanked out as he starts the pull. Brent habitually does this for some reason (I noticed it on his Olympic lifts, and he was doing it in an Olympic weightlifting meet in March to deleterious effects), and I think training alone all the time is the culprit. As you can see, Brent is strong enough that the loose starting position doesn&#8217;t prevent him from pulling the bar off the ground, affect his low back, or change the bar path. This looseness can allow the bar to swing forward as it comes off the ground, and when the bar is in front of the middle of the foot (the balance point) it&#8217;ll be exponentially harder (and cause a missed lift if it&#8217;s heavy). Letting the bar swing out front also can cause the low back to round since the lever arm is less efficient.
  

  
As Brent gets tired, you can see his hips raise before the bar gets past his knees. Ideally the back angle shouldn&#8217;t change until after the bar passes the knees. His back angle changes (hips rising, chest dropping) because his hamstrings are getting tired. The hamstrings isometrically hold the back angle in place, and since he&#8217;s doing higher reps they are getting fatigued and not doing their job. You can clearly see this as the bar passes his knees. Brent pushes his knees forward and the bar doesn&#8217;t move upward. As a result, the hips extend without applying any force to the bar, and this makes the back more vertical. In other words, the bar doesn&#8217;t move that much and the hamstrings are no longer helping, so the lockout becomes primarily a knee and back extension without including the normal hip extension.
  

  
If you&#8217;re doing a 1RM, you should pull the bar however you can. But when you&#8217;re trying to get as much musculature strong (or maximally jacked), you&#8217;d want to keep your knees back so that the hamstrings maintain their role in the movement. Brent isn&#8217;t horribly sloppy here, but if he were, there would be significant stress on the lumbar spine. If you already have back problems then you&#8217;d want to be careful with this common form fault. I&#8217;ve coached lots of people that have lumbar disc problems and they have never re-injured the existing injury. However, I&#8217;ve heard several stories recently of people hurting their backs deadlifting, and this form issue is probably the problem. Any time you change a movement mid-lift to use less muscle mass, you&#8217;ll increase the injury potential.
  

  
A coach should take care of your form faults, but if you don&#8217;t have one, a friend or camera can identify your problems. You _should_ have already learned enough about the movement that you would be able to see major errors. Once they are identified, you can cue yourself. At most you&#8217;ll think about one or two cues. In Brent&#8217;s case, I would verbally cue him to squeeze his chest up before the lift starts. This would fix his little &#8220;hips raising&#8221; issue as well as the &#8220;pulling the slack out&#8221; issue. Since 405 is relatively lighter for him, his lack of tightness isn&#8217;t detrimental, but he looks like a poon doing it. Next, I would cue his knees to stay back on the second portion of the pull. This will prevent his knees from falling forward and will keep his hamstrings tight, thus giving him a wonderful set of hams that will create the road map for a woman&#8217;s eyes to travel up to his prominent glutes he got from FedEx and squatting.
  

  
Next I would cue him to do pull-ups in his underwear.

Brent&#8217;s roommate does a fantastic job of giving him adamantly loud, yet non-descriptive cues.
