Sorry Brent, we&#8217;re gonna talk about football again. Roger Gooddell, the commissioner of the NFL, and the team owners want to [increase the regular season][1] from 16 games to 18. This would be a good thing because they&#8217;d eliminate the worthless pre-season games, but then the owners want more games (because they want to match or increase their revenue). Some of the players realize the problem here:

> &#8220;I would vote to eliminate two preseason games and then keep it at a 16-game season because the longer you&#8217;re out there playing, the more your body breaks down,&#8221; Chicago Bears tight end Desmond Clark said. &#8220;When you get into December, you&#8217;re like walking zombies. You can&#8217;t feel your joints.&#8221;

The players are TURNING INTO ZOMBIES! OMG!!!1111@!@!11!224ehjr09fujdlvkn
  

  
NFL players have resorted to eating BRAINS and the NFL wants to increase the season? I always knew there would be a zombie outbreak, and now I know the source of its [inception][2]. (GASP)&#8230;Is this a dream? I&#8217;m gonna need a [kick][3]. But&#8230;how can you kick me without any gravity?
  

  
All right, the point is that the only thing left to seal the deal on the 18 game season is playing nice with the player&#8217;s union. Let&#8217;s just assume this will happen, much like we have to assume the whole &#8220;death, taxes, and Brent Kim will be shrugging&#8221; thing. NFL players get injured enough as it is in the 16 games they already have. A quick search yielded [this bit of research][4] about injuries in the Canada West Universities Athletic Association. Regardless if it&#8217;s good research or not (I only skimmed it), we know intuitively that players are more likely to be injured in a game, on turf, if they are veteran players, if they are fatigued, and if they have a pre-existing injury. Injuries can remove a player from participating in practice and games, or it can be a [less severe injury][5] that the player has to deal with depending on their position.

The point is that football players are injured enough, and now the work load is going to be increased to a point that will be more difficult to handle, genetic freak or not. It&#8217;s obvious that pre-season games don&#8217;t garner the same physical effort or intensity as real games, and the real games are where guys are more likely to get hurt. Owners don&#8217;t realize that this will be debilitating to their investments (the players), and players will find a way to survive: steroids or other drug enhancement.

I admittedly don&#8217;t know a great deal about steroids. There are different drugs for different things, whether you want size, strength, body composition changes, and so on. They also help an athlete recover more efficiently from a work load. If a player were on a drug that achieves this, then they could stay healthy throughout the season, do their job, and continue getting paid. The average person just assumes steroids mean getting bigger and stronger, and they just assume that will equate more injuries because of crazy amounts of strength. Well, newsflash, players are gonna be [genetically freaky][6] without steroids.

Certain types of drugs can also help mend an injury whether it is surgically repaired or not. Take the following two injuries into consideration. One third of players who experience an [achilles tendon injury][7] will never play again. Of the guys that do play again, half of them don&#8217;t play at the same ability. Apparently players who [tear their patella tendon][8] will be out for at least six months. These injuries introduce a few reasons why a player would want to use drugs; A) if they are using them as a preventative tool, they could be less apt to having an injury to begin with, B) if they do get the injury, drugs may be something that allows them to get back on the field to compete, help their team, and earn money, and C) if the season is going to be longer, then injuries will be more likely for lots of reasons (fatigue, soreness, overtraining/under-recovery, accumulated injuries, etc.) and drugs may be worth trying to those who hadn&#8217;t thought about it before.
  

  
Personally, I don&#8217;t really care if people use steroids or not. I&#8217;m just saying that if the league is going to increase the length of the season, it will undoubtedly injure more players. As a result, more guys will look to prevent and return from injury any way they can. Do you care if NFL players, or professional athletes for that matter, use steroids? Would you use them if you were in the same position? Do you think Brent has injected D-bol into the base of his traps? Tell me more.
