Hey guys, Shrugthug here.
  

  
Let me go off the record in saying this &#8211;
  

  
I don&#8217;t actually think my traps are that big. Well, they aren&#8217;t big ENOUGH. I admit they are disproportionate to the rest of my body, sure, and they are probably one of the only remotely visible pieces of evidence of the fact that I lift weights. The bottom line is I weigh 175lbs and this just isn&#8217;t a significant amount of mass in general.
  

  
But as you all know, I am aggressively working to rectify this.
  

  
Justin and I have had several discussions about the need for me to develop more muscular bodyweight, particularly in my upper body, but basically, it&#8217;s generally been agreed that I need to fill out 85kg with some quality weight, and eventually 94kg if I&#8217;m planning on doing anything cool.
  

  
There have been disagreements between us about how I should go about adding that mass though (paraphrased):

> Brent: so i want to get more yoked, man
  
> 
  
> Justin: Oh yeah? What are you planning on doing?
  
> 
  
> Brent: probably some shrugs, Bill Starr style. i want bigger traps
  
> 
  
> Justin: (sigh) Your traps are big enough. You have the traps of a 215lbs guy on a 175lbs body. Maybe you should hit some other areas.
  
> 
  
> Brent: what do you mean?
  
> 
  
> Justin: I don&#8217;t know, maybe the rest of your upper body OTHER than your traps? 

We&#8217;ve had some other disputes regarding this.

> Brent: look, all i&#8217;m saying is, i don&#8217;t see why there&#8217;s a problem with me wanting to be yoked like a bull
  
> 
  
> Justin: There isn&#8217;t, but a big yoke requires the body of a bull, not a calf.

Well, here is my response to THAT:

Shrugging for 17 reps isn&#8217;t really standard ops for me. It was kind of a special day since I was training at the WFAC with Mike, and I wanted to get a PR set of 10 in. I typically have been doing these shrugs for a top set of 5 once a week, but I wanted to have some fun. I wasn&#8217;t counting reps; I think I was more concerned with telling myself I WANNA BEAT &#8216;EM. BEAT EM. BEAT EM. BEAT EM! with each rep. I figured at some point that I&#8217;d done about 10, and so I did two more &#8220;just to be sure.&#8221;
  

  
I asked Mike if I got 10. He said, &#8220;Seventeen. Close though.&#8221;
  

  
As my friend Chris says, _I was feeling reckless_.
