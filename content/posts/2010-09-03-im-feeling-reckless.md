_Editor&#8217;s Note: In case you can&#8217;t tell, this is another post by Brent. Oh, and it&#8217;s **PR Friday** so post your PR&#8217;s to the comments or update everyone on your training._
  

  
Chris Riley is a man of captivating words. Chris has always been very creative with language. We&#8217;ve mentioned it a few times before on the site &#8211; instead of saying &#8220;I need to wash my hands,&#8221; Chris will say, &#8220;I need to wash my gripz.&#8221; Instead of asking if he can taste or try something that you&#8217;re eating, he&#8217;ll ask, &#8220;Can I flavor that?&#8221; or &#8220;Do you want to flavor this?&#8221;
  

  
He also has an interesting way of insulting people. According to Chris, a &#8220;Todd&#8221; is someone who fucks everything up but doesn&#8217;t realize he is a total fuck up.
  


> Brent: The Arkansas Razorbacks are a bunch of fucking losers. They couldn&#8217;t make a touchdown if the goalie was a paraplegic.
  
> 
  
> Chris: Goalies are in soccer, Todd.
  
> 
  
> Brent: Ooh KAY.

There are some other colorful terms that Chris is fond of using, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d be appropriate to share here, but if you&#8217;d like to know more, call me, we&#8217;ll talk about it (<&#8211; this is also one of Chris&#8217;s sayings, often said in the middle of a conversation).
  

  
Oh, and the infamous WHAT ELSE ISN&#8217;T A SPORT that some of you may have seen in some of the comment threads actually originated from a night during which Chris had been drinking. Mustache Mike (not to be confused with Big Mike, who you&#8217;ve all been acquainted with) ascertained that figure skating wasn&#8217;t a sport, and Chris grew increasingly agitated as he interrogated Mike about what else wasn&#8217;t a sport.
  

  
Mike and Chris are currently training partners at WFAC. They follow a Texas Method-style program, with a volume day on Tuesdays, a light day on Thursday, and an intensity day on Saturday. Mike has observed that almost invariably, Chris comes into his Saturday workouts with the odds stacked against him. He got drunk Friday night, or he has to train in a hurry because of work, or he doesn&#8217;t eat an optimum amount of pre-workout calories because life gets in the way.
  

  
Chris, however, is a competitor.
  

  
Chris and AC are similar in that when they commit to something, they put all of themselves into it. It&#8217;s why AC gets so intense that he&#8217;s brought to tears before a 3rd attempt squat. Chris is the same way. Fight a +17lbs PR 650lbs deadlift for like 10 seconds and make it to above the knee? Ooh KAY. When Chris commits to a lift, he&#8217;ll throw everything he has into the effort, and if he fails, he&#8217;s gonna go down swinging for the fucking fences.
  

  
One particular Saturday, Chris went into the workout under shitty conditions, as usual. He takes his last squat warm up and decides to load 545lbs on the bar. He&#8217;s not sure how many times he&#8217;ll squat it, or if he&#8217;ll even be able to squat it at all today, but before he gets under the bar he turns to Mike and says one of his new trademark lines &#8211;
  

  
&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling reckless.&#8221;
  

  
And then he squats it for a PR set of 5.

Mike and I have agreed that Chris is a fantastic training partner. It&#8217;s hard to find someone who trains as hard as he does and has the raw desire to BEAT &#8216;EM. He&#8217;s overcome setbacks and has only gotten bigger and stronger. His performance is consistently excellent. Whenever I train with Chris, my motivation fucking sky rockets.

I&#8217;ll have what he&#8217;s having.
