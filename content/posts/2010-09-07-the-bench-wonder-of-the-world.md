James Henderson tells it like it is (his sweet haircut and shirt that says &#8220;BAAD&#8221; reaffirm this fact). He impressively preaches many lessons in the following video, and I&#8217;ll highlight some of them for you (you&#8217;ll appreciate them more if you watch the video, because Henderson is awesome).

Lesson 1: Light repetitions, heavy weights
  
You can&#8217;t get strong unless you lift heavy weights, yes. Heavier weights are necessary for structures to adapt and to neurologically get used to handling heavy weights. And light reps. Yeah c&#8217;mon.
  

  
Lesson 2: Thank you very much.
  
Be nice to everyone, even if you&#8217;re a big, imposing figure.
  

  
Lesson 3: Take your time, and do it right.
  
Be patient with strength training. Over time, you won&#8217;t need &#8220;all that fancy stuff like shirts and drugs&#8221;. It&#8217;s easy to say if you&#8217;re a massive human being, but exhaust solid training before reverting to other means.
  

  
Lesson 4: If you take shortcuts, you get short responses.
  
&#8220;We believe in workin&#8217; for what you get, ya know, ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; gonna be givin&#8217; to you.&#8221;
  

  
Lesson 5: &#8220;Why play with little change when you can go for the big dollars?&#8221;

Lesson 6: Be positive about your workout.
  
James requests 405 on the bar (to bench with), and says, &#8220;Gonna have a good workout today. A powerful workout.&#8221; There&#8217;s not doubt in his mind he&#8217;s gonna move some weight.
  

  
Lesson 7: Respect your warm-ups.
  
Watch James bench 405 for a few reps, then go back and watch him bench 225. They don&#8217;t look that different, and it&#8217;s because he reps out the light weights the same way that he&#8217;ll rep out the heavier weights. Respect your warm-up sets. At the very least you won&#8217;t expend any unneeded energy on lighter weights because of bad form, and you&#8217;ll establish solid motor pathways.
  

  
Lesson 8: Blow off some stress.
  
Training can be a sufficient outlet for stress. It&#8217;s probably preferable to [murder][2].
  

  
Lesson 9: Call out your spotters.
  
If they aren&#8217;t doing their job, accuse them of being drunk.
  
(See 5:30 of the video. Might be the best part.)
  

  
Lesson 10: The Zone is a delicate place, and it requires good people and a good environment.
  
Pretty self explanatory. This is why there are a lot lifters who opt to train in their garage instead of the local fitness gyms.
  

  
Lesson 11: Speed.
  
Think speed on all of your lifts and it will make it feel faster, even on the heavier lifts. James did 500 for 6 reps while thinking &#8220;speed&#8221;, and THEN he bumped on up to 600 for a triple. His focus at 500 was to move the weight fast. Moving a weight fast will increase the number of muscle fibers that are innervated, so James is on the right track.
