Before this site was active, I would repeat a quote to my friends in creepily deep voice; &#8220;You gotta make sacrifices if you wanna be&#8230;70&#8217;s Big&#8230;&#8221;
  

  
It&#8217;s true. Everyone isn&#8217;t a genetic freak so you have to work hard for your strength and muscle gains. You have to put in the time, do the work, and eat right. Sometimes &#8220;eating right&#8221; means &#8220;eating lots&#8221;. Can you dig it?
  

  
Here is the shopping list that Harrison (5&#8217;9&#8243;, 185, up from 160) and his roommate used when they shopped at Costco recently. He said it&#8217;ll last them about a week.

> 32 chicken breasts
  
> 5 ribeye steaks
  
> 4 pounds of ground beef
  
> 4 packs of bacon
  
> Pork spare ribs
  
> 126 eggs
  
> Wheat Bread
  
> Huge bag of frozen vegetables
  
> Almond Butter
  
> Fish Oil
  
> Glucosamine
  
> Alieve
  
> Whey
  
> Fresh Spinach
  
> Huge bag of carrots
  
> Huge bag of walnuts
  
> Fresh asparagus
  
> Many gallons of whole milk
  
> Many fruits (apples, oranges, bannanas, strawberries, peaches, pineapple)
  
> Teeth Whitening Strips (gotta stay pretty)
  
> Case of beer because we ran out of home brew ale (gotta stay happy) 

Here is the accompanying picture:

In related news, Michael e-mailed me about someone throwing down a challenge at work. Since he was the only &#8220;Man&#8221; in the department (only guy above 200 lbs.), he kindly obliged to attack The Whopper Challenge.
  

  
The Whopper Challenge consists of a Triple Whopper, Double Whopper, Single Whopper, and Whopper Jr. in one sitting. There is an hour time limit, but Michael shrugged that off (Brent told him to) and finished in a smug 17 minutes. The meal netted Michael around 3100 calories. Anybody want to challenge his time?

It&#8217;s time to get serious. What sacrifices have you made?
