It&#8217;s PR Friday! Post PRs in weight lifted, emos beaten, ice cream eaten, doves shot, and Yankees headbutted.
  

  
August Challenge Results have been compiled. This month&#8217;s challenge was my personal favorite because it had a lot of pitfalls. I warned against them several times, yet I fell into every one of them. I might post about my mishaps at some point. Thanks to all who sacked up to do this.
  

  
WP Strength kicked everyone&#8217;s asses in both bodyweight and totals. They took the first six spots in the men&#8217;s division and seven of the top ten (where were you bastards in the press/pullup contest?). Josh B and Ike H both lifted a literal ton of weight. In the women&#8217;s division, Angela K, Angela D, and Jenny L all topped a grand. Solid lifting, folks.
  

  
**Women absolute**

**Women by weight class**

**Men absolute**

**Men by weight class**

**Gym division**

This month is the Tactical Strength Challenge. We&#8217;ve done it before, and I&#8217;ll put it up in a sticky later. Unless you are a professional athlete, a sponsored athlete, or someone with an event looming, there is no reason to skip out on a challenge, regardless of how silly they are.
  

  
PS Keep voting for the face contest.
  

  
PPS Don&#8217;t sit there and stare at dudes. Just glance, vote, and go eat.
  

  
PPPS Yes, I know the formatting is wide. I wanted to get as much meaningful data in as possible.
