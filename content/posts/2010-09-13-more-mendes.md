I&#8217;ll announce the winners of the face contest tomorrow. This video is more important. This is a video of 20 year-old Olympic weightlifter Pat Mendes squatting 363kg/800 lbs. Completely raw. He weighs 130kg/286 lbs.

As [previous discussed][1], Pat has dual citizenship in USA and Brazil, so he&#8217;ll probably be lifting for one of these countries in the 2012 Olympics. His goal is to win gold medals and set world records &#8212; very exciting regardless of which country he lifts for.
  

  
Pat is coached by John Broz in Las Vegas. Check out the [BROZKNOWS][2] YouTube Channel for more videos of his lifters. Here is the website to [Average Broz&#8217;s Gymnasium][3].
  

  
This is one of the most impressive lifting feats I&#8217;ve seen. This could be because posting training videos on the internet didn&#8217;t happen until recently, so we don&#8217;t have tape on guys like Pisarenko, Krastev, Dimas, or Kurlovich. In your opinion, what is the most impressive strength feat you&#8217;ve seen?
  

  
Follow the jump for another impressive vid.
