Refer back to the 70&#8217;s Big Face [voting post][1]. Let&#8217;s review each face.
  

  
1 &#8211; Decent face by Adam. I&#8217;d like to see a more menacing look, maybe drop the corners of the mouth down. The wrinkled forehead almost lightens the effect, but I think the arched eyebrows add to it. Or subtract, I can&#8217;t tell.
  

  
2 &#8211; Pretty good face, Aidan. Your neck is weirding too many people out with your neck though (specifically AC). I like how he is intense here.
  

  
3 &#8211; Good use of the jaw-jut, Big_Mike. I&#8217;d grade the eyes at a B, but I think you could intensify all of it with practice. A solid face, though.
  

  
4 &#8211; I like Christian. I mean, he wore our shirt under his uniform at his wedding. But this face needs work. He&#8217;s doing the kissy face. Who does he think he is? Ben?
  

  
5 &#8211; Christ almighty, Ed. This is what I&#8217;m talking about. You use your face well to send the message that not only are you here to cause mayhem, you&#8217;re gonna enjoy it too. The beard brings out your maniacal stare. Solid fucking work.
  

  
6 &#8211; I&#8217;m proud of Gabe. He has been practicing his face. I know because I saw what his original face looked like. He kind of looked like a guy having a seizure (not a joke). I&#8217;m proud to see him score high on the fan voting.
  

  
7 &#8211; While Harrison trains hard, he tries to freestyle by adding his own zest here. Not bad, just not what we&#8217;re looking for.
  

  
8 &#8211; I like Jake&#8217;s contrast between his viking helmet and Snoopy. I&#8217;m neutral with the hand on the hip. It means business, yet is kind of childish. His glare is deafening, and I&#8217;d like to see his frown grow stronger. All said and done, this is a solid picture.
  

  
9 &#8211; I get it, James. You&#8217;re pissed because you can&#8217;t make the face. At least you can take out that anger on the barbell, though, eh?
  

  
10 &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why, but Jeremy makes me feel uncomfortable. It&#8217;s probably because there&#8217;s too much intensity in the kissy face. That compounded with the shirt off gives me the willies. A for effort though, especially with that &#8216;stache.
  

  
11 &#8211; Jesse shows off his &#8220;I&#8217;m a guy that isn&#8217;t afraid to get dirty and build a bunch of cool shit&#8221; persona right here. This is a beast of a face in its natural environment. Pretty good with that consideration, but I&#8217;d like to see more violence. Solid pic.
  

  
12 &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty impressed with Jimmy. He throws the organically angry stare in with a solid corner-of-the-lips drop. He even freestyles a bit with one eyebrow more pissed than the other. This is a very, very good picture.
  

  
13 &#8211; John is trying hard. He needs more jaw-jutting, and could stand to bring his eyebrows in check a bit. But the thing that hurts him the most is looking down at his computer monitor. It looks like he took the picture when his eyes were in mid spin back and forth. This can use some work, but I like the effort (that&#8217;s all I ask for).
  

  
14 &#8211; Ho. Ly. Shit. Woohoohoo&#8230;a fuckin&#8217; showdown. Matt&#8230;crimanies, Matt. This is amazing. A work of art. I don&#8217;t know how he S-curved his eyebrows, and I sure as hell don&#8217;t comprehend how they are as thick as that mustache. Great eyebrow work, solid menacing nose crinkle, and a great jaw jut. Take notes, ladies and gentlemen. This is a 70&#8217;s Big Face.
  

  
15 &#8211; Rob turns out to be the dark horse here. We saw Rob at the Atlanta workshop, and he has polished his technique. A picture perfect corner-lip-drop with a death stare. Solid.
  

  
16 &#8211; This.
  
Robin curiously looks like Chris with a wig. Robin is one of those guys who &#8220;gets it&#8221;.
  

  
17 &#8211; USMC.Scot&#8230;he&#8217;s intense, but he&#8217;s doing a different face.
  

  
18 &#8211; You guys like this guy because he&#8217;s crazy and I gave him a sweet name, but this isn&#8217;t the face at all. He looks like that [triceratops][2] from &#8220;Land Before Time&#8221; (there are zero pictures on the internet of those fucking dinosaurs with their mouths closed). The mouth is all wrong, but you all got sidetracked by his beard. From the nose up, he&#8217;s good, but the face is dependent on the corners of the mouth. Sorry Beardman.
  

  
19 &#8211; Haha, I like Wilmar. This picture makes me laugh. You can tell he&#8217;s hammered. He&#8217;s doing a pretty good job, maybe freestyling too much with the mouth, but altogether pretty solid.
  

  
20 &#8211; WannaBBurly slid in at the last second (&#8220;that&#8217;s what she said&#8221; jokes are pussy and lame). Not bad, but AC didn&#8217;t appreciate that he didn&#8217;t even get up from the couch to take this picture.
  

  
**And the winners are&#8230;**
  
Personally I think it should have been a vote off between Matt and Robin, but the fans have spoken. Using Jake was sneaky for victory, but it worked. His pops also did some Facebook campaigning to win this one. However, since Jake&#8217;s camp took advantage of his cuteness, he will default to second place. Matt is the second voted face, and it&#8217;s perfect. He wins. I&#8217;m going to send Jake&#8217;s dad a prize, though. I&#8217;ll let Matt decide if he wants the posters or a t-shirt. Jake&#8217;s camp will get the opposite.
  

  
Nice work everybody. I think the best faces are Gabe, Matt, and Robin. I think Robin should have been voted much higher, but some of you don&#8217;t know what it is you&#8217;re voting for. Observe&#8230;
