Whether you are a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger or not, he is an inspiring man. He has lived his life in a continuous desire to succeed. In this video as well in his autobiography, he puts an emphasis on having a mindset that won&#8217;t fail. Everyone on this site isn&#8217;t going to be the best in the world at what they do, but you can still set your goals and stomp towards them, never letting up. Whether it was bodybuilding, business, acting, or politics, Arnold knew what he wanted and did everything he could to obtain it. Let&#8217;s do the same.
