I can get you in excess of 25% off on quality strength training equipment (depending on the product). Unfortunately if you go to the York Barbell website, it&#8217;s difficult to find the products you are probably interested in (ex. Olympic weightlifting stuff compared to fitness barbells). I have the catalogs that are full of power bars, Olympic weightlifting bars, plates (iron/bumper), dumbbells, squat stands, racks, etc. If you&#8217;re interested in browsing or you know you want to make a purchase, [E-MAIL ME][2] and I can help get you the catalog and the quote (including shipping).

I&#8217;ve lifted with different kinds of York equipment and seem to prefer it over other brands. Iron york plates that have hard edges stay on the bar better when you&#8217;re squatting and since the diameter of the hole is tighter, the bar doesn&#8217;t flop to the side when you&#8217;re deadlifting. Some of you have probably done some Olympic lifting on a York power bar that has been called something else. I&#8217;ve even used this particular bar to power clean and power snatch, and it was pretty fluid for a power bar! If you&#8217;ve used a cheap bar for your Olympic lifts, then I feel sorry for you. The other day I did power cleans in a fitness facility and about broke my damn wrists trying to turn the bar over &#8212; crappy bars will not spin.
  


I own the York Olympic training bar, and I love it. I can feel it&#8217;s whip in the middle of my pulls, especially as I pull the first part of my clean off the floor and when I dip/drive for the jerk. My first opportunity to go heavy in the Olympic lifts was in early August since nationals (mid June), and I clean and jerked 155kg (157 at nats) and kinda passed out after a 160kg clean (I&#8217;ve got the whole passing out thing taken care of). I know the whip of the training bar I was using was critical in sticking the jerks as they got heavier. The bar just seemed to rebound and rubber band it&#8217;s way to my lockout position. A beautiful feeling.

So if you&#8217;re interested in stuff for your gym or your basement/garage, send me an e-mail and you can browse the catalog. I&#8217;ve even used the squat stands, which are standard for Olympic weightlifters and the next best thing to a full rack. Shoot me an E-MAIL and we&#8217;ll get it rolling. Dealing with crappy equipment is never fun.
