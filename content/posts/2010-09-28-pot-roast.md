70&#8217;s Big reader Harrison shows you how to make pot roast. Finally, some more recipe submissions. I&#8217;ll ask him for a cliff notes in case you don&#8217;t watch the 9 minute vid.
  
**_Edit:</strong> I forgot to note that the quote that I was credited with in the video was said by Gant._
  
**_Edit 2:</strong>You can find the recipe explanation [here][1] (let me know if this link doesn&#8217;t work)._

What other hearty meals do we need to see?
