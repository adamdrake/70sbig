I think yesterday&#8217;s post is pretty important and relevant to most of you. At least go over the information and use it to start actively thinking about what you do in training. If you&#8217;d like to spark more discussion, then add it to yesterday&#8217;s comments.

I don&#8217;t know who [Warrick Brant][1] was before my friend Jacob sent me a video of him front squatting 350kg.

This dude is cocked diesel and a solid Australian competitor. From his profile:

> After Breaking my neck in 2001 and having multiple screws and plates put in to hold my neck together, I realised how important it is to do the things you love and to never give up.
  
> Since then I have won multiple powerlifting and strongman titles and have never been defeated in Australia or by any other Australian athlete.

Apparently he&#8217;s stomping ass in Australia. Apparently he&#8217;s been a big dude [for a while][2]. Here is a vid of him doing a 412kg car deadlift:
