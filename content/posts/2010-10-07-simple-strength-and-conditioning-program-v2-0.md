[An Effective, Yet Simple Strength and Conditioning Program][1]
  

  
I devised a program in 2009 for my CrossFit class that placed an emphasis on getting stronger. I created a .pdf of the outline and sent it around the internet, and it has been floating around since. I&#8217;ve wanted to update that file to clarify some concepts as well as improve the writing style. I&#8217;ve also made a small amendment to the program. What used to be known as the CFWF program is something I just call the Strength and Conditioning Program (SC&P) &#8212; my friends at Amarillo Strength and Conditioning/CF Amarillo started the name, so I&#8217;m just going to keep it.
  

  
I blatantly point out that this program is for a strength novice who has neglected strength training. It may not be optimal for certain athletic specialties, yet I see it as a preparatory program for sports in general. I&#8217;ve had lots of people get pretty strong using this &#8212; one friend took his 400x1RM deadlift to 450&#215;5 while gaining 20 pounds of muscle, and maintained or improved benchmark CrossFit workouts.
  

  
The conditioning workouts can be tailored to fit a personal style or goal. Someone needing to prepare for a PT test would condition for the test using the principles I lay out in the outline. If someone wanted to prepare for specific sports, events, or military obligations, shifting the ratio of strength:conditioning would be necessary. I&#8217;ll update it soon with workouts I and others have created and used while doing it.
  

  
Basically, if you&#8217;re someone that needs to increase strength while keeping conditioning in a program, this is for you.
