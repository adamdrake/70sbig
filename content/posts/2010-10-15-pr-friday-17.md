PR Friday is a time to rejoice in any personal records you hit in the past week, update everyone on your training, and ask random training questions. Chances are other readers can help, and if not I&#8217;ll provide my own opinion. Good day to you, sir/madame.
  

  
I&#8217;ll add stuff to this throughout Friday, but the following video has nothing to do with 70&#8217;s Big.
  

  
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wpGytSa7-SA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
  

  
Update: I said I was gonna add some stuff, but I&#8217;ve got nothin&#8217;. I&#8217;ve been doing this for over a year every week day, and unless I write an in depth post, I&#8217;ve got nothin&#8217;.
