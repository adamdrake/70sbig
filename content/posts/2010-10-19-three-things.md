**1.** [Here][1] is an interesting article that will be useful for a very small percentage of you. I&#8217;ll explain why in a later post, but it&#8217;s an interesting read.
  

  
**2.** I&#8217;ve explained this in a comment, but not everyone reads all of the comments.
  
I&#8217;m not hurting for writing ideas. When I write something for the site, I&#8217;ll write out my draft, then go back through it at least once and edit it to make it more concise and vigorous. The process of writing a simple post takes, at the minimum, 30 minutes for a useful and entertaining article (the average time would be over an hour). There are times when I a) don&#8217;t want to spend my night writing a post, b) don&#8217;t have time to spend my night writing a post, and c) am not in the mood to be moderately entertaining in the post. Hardly any of you care when I write about something in a dry manner (although its application is very useful for you &#8212; [example][2]). The two posts with the highest page views and individual visitors are [this][3] and [this][4]. The first post is me in a speedo and the second is Rachel in a sports bra. That&#8217;s totally fine with me (I&#8217;m amused by the former), but the reality is that hardly any of you will give a hoot unless I&#8217;m thoroughly entertaining.
  

  
If one of the above reasons occurs and I&#8217;m not planning on writing a proper article, then I&#8217;ll usually post a video, picture, or story as a filler. I&#8217;ll remind you that this website has posted five days a week for over a year, and I don&#8217;t have much compensation aside from the fact that I&#8217;m helping a lot of people. I&#8217;m not asking for anything, I&#8217;m just pointing out that it&#8217;s a variable in deciding whether or not I&#8217;m going to spend an hour or two out of my day providing daily content.
  

  
Luckily you can do something about this. You can send me videos, pictures, stories, questions, testimonials, and the like that have anything to do with 70&#8217;s Big (literal or allegorical), strength training, food, conditioning, fitness, women who train, etc. This will give me &#8220;filler&#8221; content in between posts where I actually do write out an original article/post.
