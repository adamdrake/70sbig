The Internationa Powerlifting Federation (IPF) has re-structured their weight classes.
  
**The old weight classes:**
  
Men (kg)
  
56/60/67.5/75/82.5/90/100/110/125/125+
  
Women (kg)
  
48/52/56/60/67.5/75/82.5/90/90+
  

  
**New Weight Classes**
  
Men
  
58/66/74/83/93/105/120/120+
  

  
Women
  
47/52/57/63/72/84/84+
  

  
I don&#8217;t know what to make of it. In both cases the cap for heavyweights was lowered and the minimum changed (men&#8217;s increased, women&#8217;s decreased). I know that Chris won&#8217;t be slimming down to the 265 lbs weight class, so it looks like he&#8217;ll be a super heavyweight. There&#8217;s speculation of why the weight classes were changed, but I&#8217;m not familiar with the variables that went into the official decision (I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of pissed off dudes). Feel free to share any info you find.
  

  
Additionally, I always look at the USAPL as the standard in powerlifting. I&#8217;ve had issues with their judging (and other people have echoed the same), but it&#8217;s one federation that is prominent throughout the country. I&#8217;m not a fan of having eight thousand different federations (Hitler is most definitely NOT a fan either, see video below). It seems that the changing weight classes will just stir the pot around a bit more and promote disparity between feds. Thoughts?

**Beard of the Day** goes to Brian Daboll, Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator, who called a HELL of a game against the New England Patriots last Sunday. He sported a decent beard (and a shaved head, so he looks extra creepy) in the big victory in which running back Peyton Hillis rushed had over 200 yards of offense (184 yards of bruising, biceps-led rushing), and Colt McCoy pulled his weight in completing 74% of his passes, making key third down throws, and scoring a rushing touchdown. More importantly, this fired Daboll the. fuck. up. He basically attacked McCoy after his rushing touchdown and almost knocked him over. Finally&#8230;something to be glad about as a Browns fan.
