## WARNING

70&#8217;s Big may cause adverse effects in your life by changing your physique and/or mentality. Take careful note of these possibilities and verify that you are prepared for such changes.
  

  
**Abnormal Increases In Size**
  
Beginning a proper quest to 70&#8217;s Big will result in exceptional increases in muscular development. This may cause problems if you are A) emo, B) attend art school, or C) live in California or Europe. Expect the following:
  
&#8211; you will fill out your 70&#8217;s Big shirts
  
&#8211; your pants will no longer fit
  
&#8211; there is a 50% chance that your clothing will rip and fall right off of your body in fear
  
&#8211; your underwear/spandex will become uncomfortable unless you upgrade
  
&#8211; if you wear swim trunks with the netting on the inside, it will wedge up your butt crack because you&#8217;ll have amazing glutes (if I do say so myself)
  
&#8211; dress shirts will not fit around your neck, even if you get fitted for a tux/suit for the specific reason of having it fit (he even measured my neck, wtf?)
  

  
**Uncomfortable Gains In Strength**
  
Your abnormal size gains express an uncomfortable (dare I say uncanny?) increase in strength. Take caution with your daily activities as they are now a smaller percentage of your absolute strength. Beware of the following:
  
&#8211; hug your lady carefully lest you suffocate her (don&#8217;t be Lennie Small)
  
&#8211; avoid fine China
  
&#8211; exhibit caution when pretending to be a zombie in order to show your friends what it would be like to be attacked by an intense zombie&#8230;who lifts weights&#8230;
  
&#8211; consider projectile motion trajectory when tossing children in the pool; anything other than a resultant vector in the vertical direction could land the child on the roof, a busy highway, or a grizzly bear den
  
&#8211; ready yourself for accusations of steroids or alien anal probing, for it is unnatural to the average person that you have doubled your squat and gained 25 pounds of muscle in a couple of months
  

  
**Stark Changes In Personality**
  
With this size and strength you will be overcome with a sense of honor and pride that throws itself intensely into tasks of self betterment. You will find yourself:
  
&#8211; knocking down personal goals
  
&#8211; ready to take on the trials of life
  
&#8211; and doing so with an intensity and focus that ripples the earth to its iron-nickel alloy core
  

  
**Heed this warning; 70&#8217;s Big is a process that results in unfathomable changes.**
