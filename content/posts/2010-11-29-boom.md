Football is a sport: fact. Here&#8217;s a beautiful video of Browns running back Peyton Hillis bulldozing the Panther&#8217;s Charles Godfrey before scoring his third rushing touchdown. [SB Nation][1] says 

> Judging by his touchdown celebrations, he&#8217;s also a big fan of &#8217;80s cage wrestling, all monster trucks besides Grave Digger (sellout), and the paleo diet.

Hillis is from Arkansas, so I&#8217;d tend to disagree with the paleo thing. He&#8217;s also definitely 70&#8217;s Big.

Also being a little shit (i.e. under 200 pounds) can only get you so far. Andre Johnson got pissed enough to [punch Cortland Finnegan in the head][2]. If you don&#8217;t know the background, Cortland is one of the dirtiest players in the league and has been fined several times this year for his assholery (I guess he&#8217;s trying to make up for being named &#8220;Cortland&#8221;). Aggressive, good; dickhead, bad. I want to point out that Johnson is 220+, and thus won the round.
