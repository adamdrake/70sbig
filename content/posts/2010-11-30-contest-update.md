The Novembeardly challenge is still going on. Get all your beard/burly pics in, and then we can vote/evaluate them and get a contest winner. Also, the results from the Thanksgiving weight gain festivities will be calculated.
  

  
I had a post all typed out for today, yet I determined it would be much better with video. In addition to that, I have a post coming about those of you that appreciate the benefits of strength, but may only be concerned with &#8220;looking great&#8221;. Here&#8217;s a preview:
  
&#8220;Hey man, I&#8217;m more of a Corvette; I&#8217;m made to look great in the garage instead of going out and performing on the road.&#8221;
  
&#8211;Shawn, to me after feeling the effects of our workout last Saturday
  
Stay tuned for more.
  

  
To ready you for the Novembeardly submissions, take a gander at this pic. WildCard1989 sent it to me, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s him or not. The subject of the e-mail was, &#8220;Is this manly enough for ya?&#8221;

I also can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s real, because that mama bear in the background would be severing some heads.
