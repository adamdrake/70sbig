## PR Friday

State your PR&#8217;s or update us on your training. Feel free to ask questions, I&#8217;ll check them throughout today. Also if there are specific topics you&#8217;d like to hear about, I can do my best to write about them.
  


## Videos

The first video shows Chris squatting 500&#215;10 &#8212; YEAH BUUUUUUDYYYYYYYY! Brent has already chastised Mike for his camera work, so I won&#8217;t do it here. He moves behind Chris towards the end of the set to spot him.
  

  

  

  
The second video is Mike squatting 430&#215;10 in time period where he&#8217;s cutting weight for a PT test. Chris doesn&#8217;t say much; he must be tired from his set. Good lifting, fellas.
  

  

  

  
Do you have a video of you hitting some PR&#8217;s in a good training environment? Send them to <Justin@70sbig.com>.
  

  
_Edit: There may be some additions to this post throughout the day. You can also see more at the 70&#8217;s Big Facebook page._
