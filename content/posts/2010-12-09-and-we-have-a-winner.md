## Novemburly Beard Contest

Josh from Quebec pulled a stunning Joe Namath-like upset by declaring himself the winner, and aiming to get 1870&#8217;s Big. When the polls closed he was beating Trampas by a pube of 142 votes to 136. Honorable mention goes out to Tallahassee&#8217;s Robert with 124 votes. Thanks to all the man-men who submitted their beard pics.

## 70&#8217;s Big Euro Tour

My Irish pal John Benton and I are creating a diabolical plot that would bring the new and updated 70&#8217;s Big Strength and Conditioning Workshops to Europe. John has sent some feelers (I guess feeling is an Irish thing) and the following cities are potential hosts: 2 venues in Dublin, 2-3 venues in the U.K (Manchester,London, and possibly Cardiff Wales and Newcastle), Copenhagen, and Basel, Switzerland.
  

  
If you are interested in attending or hosting, then let us know in the comments, on the [Facebook fan page][1], or [e-mail me][2]. The more venues or attendees there, the more likely the trip can happen.
  


## Chat Room Vote

We are going to start a weekly chat room meeting. During this time readers can ask questions to me or anybody else (AC, Chris, Mike, Brent, and others assuming they are present) about pretty much anything.
