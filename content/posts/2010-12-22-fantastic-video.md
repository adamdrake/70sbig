Short post today. This is a video of Zach Krych, and 85kg Olympic weightlifter. This video details an incredible story where he suffered a devastating injury to his wrists. It shows his recovery and rehab process in chronological order. Zach not only recovers from his injury, but he also performs at the highest level by winning the US Senior Nationals and closes in on Kendrick Farris&#8217; (the top American 85kg lifter) total. This is one of the most impressive videos I&#8217;ve ever seen, and this is one of the biggest comebacks in any sport. Congrats to Zach and good luck.
  

  


If you are a fan of the 70&#8217;s Big Facebook fan page, then you already saw the [Meatball Deathstar][1] by [Epic Meal Time][2] (that&#8217;s smart). This next video isn&#8217;t their most violent or intense, but it&#8217;s fucking impressive. It&#8217;s the Slaughterhouse Christmas Special:
  

  

  
Edit:
  
The chat room was last night (every Tuesday evening) and was interesting. There weren&#8217;t as many questions as week 1, and the topics got kinda weird at times (I blame this on AC). Anyway, we&#8217;ll do the next one next Tuesday.
