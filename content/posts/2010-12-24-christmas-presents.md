## CHRISTMAS = PRESENTS

The fire light dances off the wrapping paper as you are surrounded by a subtle glow from your family’s Christmas tree. The wrapped gift in your lap says, “To: You, From: Santa”. The welling of excitement is nearly pouring out of your body as your parents give you the okay to open your gift. What could it be? Surely it is something wonderful and fun. Your hands tear the paper away to reveal not only your first Christmas gift, but jubilation.
  

  
This scenario is similar to most childhood Christmas experiences. Traditions are kept alive and passed to children, and each family has their own way of celebrating Christmas. Some people don’t celebrate Christmas – they either have conflicting religious beliefs or lost interest over the years – but these people are the American minority. Most celebrate Christmas for religious reasons, specifically the symbolic birth of Christ. This symbolic birth is often cited as the “true meaning of Christmas”, but deep down nobody actually believes that. Christmas is all about presents.
  

  
I know what you’re thinking. Presents are a materialistic and you were always taught that there is more to Christmas than just opening presents. WRONG! Christmas = presents.
  

  
**Christmas is about getting presents.** The anticipation of presents is sometimes better than the gift itself. Most presents are thoughtful, helpful, or amusing, yet unwrapping gifts fills us with a childlike sensation that only occurs next to that colorful tree.
  

  
**Christmas is about giving presents.** The reciprocal of getting is giving, and once you mature you realize how much joy you get out of giving gifts. It can be hard figuring out what the perfect gift is, but in reality it doesn’t matter; you did something thoughtful for someone you cared about, and that’s all that matters.
  

  
Giving and receiving presents creates a fun, exciting atmosphere that resonates outside of the living room. Folks at work are relaxed, people at the store are nice, and there is a growing level of anxiousness that looks forward to Christmas day. This brings me to the most important point:
  

  
**The greatest Christmas present is your family.** Family is relative; it can mean your parents and siblings, your friends, or anyone else that you genuinely care about. The gift of spending quality time with your family is a present that is insurmountable. This may be the only time of year you get to see your family, and it’s the holiday season that allows this to happen. The sights and sounds of Christmas are all a pleasant prelude to the true meaning of Christmas: presents.
  

  
Nobody thinks about religious meaning or pagan traditions as they rip away wrapping paper; instead they are enjoying the emotions and nostalgia of sharing not only gifts, but each other’s presence. I hope you and your family create beautiful memories this holiday season while holding past Christmas memories close to your heart.
  

  
Merry Christmas. And shit.
