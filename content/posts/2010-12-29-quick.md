I&#8217;m out and about, so here&#8217;s a quick thought. In the chat room last night there was a mild discussion on nutrition. Someone asked how to lose their gut in order to get stronger. Realistically, if you&#8217;re unhappy with your bodyfat (if you&#8217;re fat, and everyone knows it), then you need to make modifications in your overall diet. If you&#8217;re still eating processed foods, drinking soda, and eating sugary foods, then doing any kind of fat loss diet is irrelevant. Drop the shitty foods from your regular diet and then get your macronutrients under control. If you don&#8217;t know what that means, then you have some reading to do. If you are skinny or fat, you have done something your whole life to be skinny or fat. Therefore, you have to do things differently to no longer be that way. Start the overhaul now.
  

  
Dr. Michael Hartman joined us in our chat last evening and was particularly helpful with Olympic weightlifting questions. [This is his website/blog][1] &#8212; there will be new additions in the new year (updates slowed as the professor obligations increased in the fall semester).
  

  
Lastly, go and read yesterday&#8217;s post. That concept needs to be reiterated to a lot of people.
