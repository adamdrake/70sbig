I&#8217;m going to be hiking with my pup early Thursday morning, so here&#8217;s a quick Q&A.
  

  
From yesterday&#8217;s comments, aramirez asks

> Reading about conditioning brings up a question I have had since I read the longevity and being active article a few weeks ago. I sit behind a computer all day. I train three times a week doing the main lifts (squats, press, bench press, deadlift, etc). No cardio, no conditioning. My cousin who is a conditioning/strength endurance guy, says that heavy weight training alone three times a week is not enough to maintain overall health. He says even though my strength and muscle mass is increasing, my cardiovascular health is not being trained therefore I am still prone to cardiovascular issues. Is this true? Taking extrinsic factors such as smoking, drugs, family disease history, etc. out of the picture is a cardio training component needed for overall health and longevity, or is weight training three times a week enough?

The first question I have is, &#8220;What is aramirez training for?&#8221; I get tons of questions &#8212; so much that I have been backed up on e-mails for a couple months now (the chat room is a way to get an immediate response). Over 90% of the questions are vague to the point that I can&#8217;t answer them without asking questions in return. If you are trying to get advice on inducing adaptations in your body &#8212; whether it be programming, exercises, food intake, injury issues, recovery issues, &#8220;mobility&#8221; issues, etc. &#8212; then I&#8217;m gonna need adequate information to give you an opinion on the matter. &#8220;Adequate information&#8221; means what you&#8217;re training for, what you&#8217;re currently doing, and current state of adaptation. Perhaps you don&#8217;t know how to identify some of those things (I guess I&#8217;ll give them operational definitions later), but make an attempt if you want a quicker, more concise answer.
  

  
With that being said, I will go ahead and assume aramirez here wants to get stronger while at the same time maintaining good health. He may participate in some kind of strength-related competition at some point, but we&#8217;ll go ahead and assume it&#8217;s a hobby. I&#8217;ll also go ahead and assume he isn&#8217;t &#8220;hardcore bulking&#8221; &#8212; a term I will use to explain someone who is completely committed to gaining weight (with a properly volumed program) quickly. People who should be &#8220;hardcore bulking&#8221; are skinny guys who are 90&#8217;s Small (it makes them more likeable). In any case, we&#8217;ll assume aramirez is your average strength training guy who wants to continue getting stronger with consistent barbell training over time, but wants to be healthy and doesn&#8217;t want his health to suffer.
  

  
In such a case, yes, conditioning is in order. Now, I don&#8217;t know what his cousin does (I don&#8217;t care), but aramirez doesn&#8217;t have to do anything fancy to maintain health. This is why retired or older lifters love the prowler so much; it&#8217;s something that stimulates their cardiorespiratory and vascular system to produce an adaptation, but it isn&#8217;t something lame like &#8220;jogging&#8221; or a LSD type endurance. It&#8217;s important to note several things:
  
1. A guy who just wants to maintain health doesn&#8217;t need a whole lot of conditioning, and doesn&#8217;t really need more than a day of _effective_ conditioning.
  
2. The prowler meets the qualification of #1, but the prowler is also a supreme conditioning tool that can help a trainee obtain high levels of conditioning ability.
  
3. The prowler isn&#8217;t a requisite. You can use your car, assuming someone is behind the wheel and/or you aren&#8217;t rolling it towards a cliff.
  
4. Pushing things like a prowler or burning vehicle aren&#8217;t the only options. You can do higher rep sets on timed intervals with big lifts (think squat, deadlift, and power cleans). You can do barbell complexes. You can do lower rep callisthenic complexes. You can run intervals. You can combine these things with jumping if you want to feel more athletic.
  

  
Yes, some conditioning work will be helpful to maintain cardiovascular/respiratory health. No, you don&#8217;t need to think really hard on what to do or when to do it. Just throw it after one of the harder workouts, but don&#8217;t put it on a day before a harder workout (even if it&#8217;s your rest day from lifting). One day a week is fine for a guy who just wants to maintain. Two or three workouts can be used by a guy wanting to build a little conditioning. Four days a week is not necessary, unless you&#8217;re training for something. The priority is keep it short and intense, and don&#8217;t interfere with your lifting. If you disrupt recovery for strength training, then you are this guy:
