My mom likes to leave the tv on as she goes through her morning routine. One show called &#8220;The Doctors&#8221; pissed me off this morning. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, there is a medical doctor, an OBGYN, a plastic surgeon, and a pediatrician. Today they were giving fitness advice, and it was a fucking joke. Let me clarify something: just because you are professionally called a Doctor &#8212; even if it&#8217;s a Doctor that treats the human body &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t mean you know dick about fitness or exercise.
  

  
These hosts of the show were demonstrating some kind of vibrating machine that you stand on. The main host, who is a young pencil-neck medical doctor, was sitting on this vibrating machine and said that it &#8220;really engages your abs&#8221;. I started cussing at the TV. A second later he pulled out a shake weight, and I left the room. Later, the OBGYN &#8212; who, by definition, inspects vaginas &#8212; was telling people to do wall sits in order to build muscle and burn fat (not to mention her own knees weren&#8217;t at a 90 degree angle, which was one of her requirements in her &#8220;explanation).

Here&#8217;s the problem: we all know that this stuff is bullshit. I can make fun of these idiots every day, but it won&#8217;t matter because the viewers that buy into this malarkey don&#8217;t know the difference. It&#8217;s your responsibility to educate other people on what is or isn&#8217;t worth a damn. That means it&#8217;s your responsibility to learn not only &#8220;what to do&#8221;, but &#8220;why to do it&#8221;. I try to go over this stuff regularly so that you&#8217;ll have a conceptual understanding of the &#8220;why&#8221;, but I only reach three or four thousand people a day. There are millions &#8212; fucking MILLIONS &#8212; of people who now think wall sits will build their glutes.
  

  
I don&#8217;t want you go about this like an asshole, though. You need to respectfully inform &#8212; you know, teach them. If you go and say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a bunch of bullshit. You need to do this&#8221;, then you just drive people away. You owe it to people in your life, particularly those that you care about, to help them get on the right track. They all aren&#8217;t going to start squatting two or three times a week, but if they learn why compound strength movements not only build muscle, but that muscle helps burn fat, they may want to change their habits. But then again, most people are hopelessly stupid with their health. We can still try to help anyway by teaching, not bashing. Good luck. I&#8217;m here if you need help on how to do it.
