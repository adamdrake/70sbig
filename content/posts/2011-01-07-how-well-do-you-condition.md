**Post your own conditioning workouts and I&#8217;ll tell you whether they are useful or not.**
  
With the advent of CrossFit and other various conditioning methods out nowadays, the average trainee or lifter think they have a good grasp on conditioning. Personally, I don&#8217;t like most suggestions readers make for their programs for various reasons. Instead of giving you guidelines for conditioning (I&#8217;ve done this before and will do so again more specifically in the future), this post will give you an opportunity to post conditioning workouts that you would use in a strength and conditioning program.
  

  
I shouldn&#8217;t have to clarify, but there are two such versions: 1) a program that aims to increase strength while maintaining or improving conditioning and B) a program that aims to maintain strength while improving conditioning. #1 is the case of a person who still needs to get stronger and wants to add some conditioning in OR an athlete in their off-season who is increasing their strength base; #2 is someone who is already strong &#8212; they are fucking cocked-diesel, or have more than adequate levels of strength for their sport/activity &#8212; or someone who is in sport preparation and needs to add conditioning in.
  

  
So, post your conditioning workouts and I&#8217;ll grade them out on their usefulness in a program while making other relevant notes.

**PR Friday**
  
If you&#8217;re new to the site, Friday is the day where you can gloat. Post your PR&#8217;s to the comments. They can be lifting, eating, tossing, or cloth ripping related. If you didn&#8217;t hit any PR&#8217;s, then give everyone an update on your training. The regular posters will remember your name and mostly say nice things, and the lurkers will continue to creepily stalk you. Fun!
