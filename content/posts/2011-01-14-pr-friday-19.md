I&#8217;ve been moving, so there isn&#8217;t gonna be much of a post today. I&#8217;ve got lots of things planned for you guys including more TM-related posts, interviews, videos, and maybe even that podcast idea. Post your PR&#8217;s, training updates, questions, or musings to the comments and I&#8217;ll reply to them whenever I have internet this weekend. Have a good&#8217;un.

This is what Brent looked like when I met him:
  

  

  
Here are Brent&#8217;s squat attempts in a meet we did at WFAC in February of 2009. Brent hits 180kg for his last attempt. He has since hit around 210kg in a meet (sorry Brent, can&#8217;t remember).
