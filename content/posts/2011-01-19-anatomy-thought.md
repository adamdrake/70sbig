I&#8217;ve been asked what I did to &#8220;learn what I know&#8221; about training, programming, analyzing movement, etc. I&#8217;m also routinely asked questions on lifting technique, programming, differences in types of lifts, and other strength related topics &#8212; you know, the stuff that this website focuses on. In school I studied things like anatomy, physiology, physics, biomechanics, and how to apply those fundamental courses to basic movement. However, it was after graduating when I really learned a lot. I&#8217;ve spent thousands of hours reading material that ranges from subject matter experts in running to Russian Olympic weightlifting research. I&#8217;ve also taken life risks that put me in a position to learn from the source, learn quickly, and think critically and objectively. In order for me to accept something as truth (or a hypothesis that is more true than false), I have to be provided proof of its truth or think through every single nuance of the topic and come to a logical conclusion. This is how I function.
  

  
One of the things I learned from Mark Rippetoe is how important &#8220;being able to think&#8221; is. Rip didn’t teach me how to think (I&#8217;ve always done so), but helped me realize how important it is not only to things like analyzing movements, but to life. Rip always cited his first Chemistry lab as the most important class he has ever taken because it requires using the scientific method and trial and error (I’m paraphrasing, I’m sure he’s written about it before, but you could ask him). Science helps create an objective, methodical way of thinking for oneself. By regularly doing this, you won’t easily accept authoritarian advice without proof, and it helps you think around subjects. Thinking around a subject can open up possibilities that an outlined, linear, and predetermined process otherwise wouldn’t.
  

  
In order to be good at programming, analyzing mechanics, etc., you must “be able to think”. Whatever the situation, you can analyze what is going on, collect as much data as possible, cross-check what you have found with what you have seen and learned in the past, consider the macro and micro effects, and then give an educated opinion on the matter. However, in order to do all this well in the realm of strength and conditioning, you need to have an appropriate background.
  

  
The first class we started with in school regarding the Exercise Science and Kinesiology field of study was Anatomy and Physiology &#8212; and for good reason. If you don’t know how the body is put together or how that body functions, then you can’t apply it to anything. Unfortunately most training certifications or coaches have a rudimentary knowledge of this field (and, admittedly, the same goes for most of the people that were and are in my major). You won’t need to know all the nuances of the endocrine system or the gastrointestinal tract, but you absolutely need to know where things are located in the body.
  

  
If you can’t determine what muscle someone has hurt (when you’re coaching them), you can’t explain why you’re doing a lift a certain way, or you don’t know what it is you’re trying to stress when implementing conditioning…you are failing. We’ve all heard how the fitness industry is failing, so I’ll leave it at that. Instead I want to talk about the first step: anatomy. 

Anatomy is the map of where everything is. By knowing where everything is, you’ll know how the body uses these things in order to move. If you’re going to program for yourself or other people, this should be second nature (90% of the time it isn’t). The best way that you can learn muscular and skeleton anatomy is by picking up bones, touching them, and learning everything about them. Doing so would give you the knowledge of where tendons, ligaments, and other structures attach and articulate. From there you learn muscles and where they attach on those bony landmarks. After learning the micro anatomy you can understand the big picture in “macro anatomy”, or applying it to holistic movement. Unfortunately cadavers creep people out (not me, I’ve held a human heart in my hand in complete wonder) and plastic casts of bones are only found in schools, so that puts most of you at a disadvantage.
  

  
Until recently I had to recommend muscular anatomy books that were made for physical/massage therapists to help people with anatomy. These books are excellent, but it augments the knowledge gained from the initial hands-on learning process and are more valuable in the field. There wasn’t really a book that did a good job of teaching &#8220;from the bone up&#8221; while bringing it all together with gross movement patterns. Until now.

[Anatomy Without A Scalpel][2] is this book. Dr. Lon Kilgore had been working on this anatomy book for years, and probably had dreams of creating it while he received his doctorate in Anatomy and Physiology from Kansas State University. Lon is an excellent artist and drew all the pictures in the book, took all the photos, created all the diagrams, and wrote all the chapters. He formulated this anatomy book from the bone up.
  

  
This book is particularly useful for coaches, trainers, and trainees in strength and conditioning. Lon teaches the bony landmarks, shows where the muscles are, then has in-depth discussions on the most efficient ways to train the musculature. Lon is a teacher at heart, and the book is entirely focused on teaching you anatomy, fundamentals of movement, and coaching by having repetition in text, pictures, photos, and diagrams. If you have had a vague interest in anatomy or you are a coach/trainer, I wholeheartedly recommend this book to boost your knowledge of anatomy and human function.
  

  
Besides, if you all read it, I wouldn’t have to go over the fundamentals so many times when I explain things.
