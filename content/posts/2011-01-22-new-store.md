## New Store

Ladies and gentlemen, I want to present to you the new and improved [70&#8217;s Big Store][1]. This new store has the same shirts as the old store, yet the images are on both regular and American Apparel shirts. New products are also on the way this coming week. The store is powered by [SpreadShirt.com][2] and will continuously expand (updates will be posted here and on the [70&#8217;s Big Facebook Fan Page][3]).
  

  
Here&#8217;s a peak at the store:
