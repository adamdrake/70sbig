There is a new shirt available in the 70&#8217;s Big Store that is based on the intensity Chris brings to training. There are days when you go into the gym and you don&#8217;t feel your best. Whether it&#8217;s because you were up late drinking beer, not eating or sleeping well, or feeling drained from a busy week, you step towards a barbell and start warming up.
  

  
&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll just have a medium day,&#8221; you think. But once you put that bar on your back and get a feel for each warm-up, your mindset mutates and develops. 135, 225, and 315. Each set feels easier. Your psychological momentum is rolling in spite of your physical fatigue. Biology tries to convince you it isn&#8217;t your day, but you grimace and say, &#8220;Fuck it&#8230;I&#8217;m feeling reckless.&#8221; This is what training is all about; conquering gravity in what you previously thought was impossible. Stomping into heavy sets with reckless abandon is something only a crazy person would do. Are you reckless?

The phrase actually came after Chris squatted something crazy (500&#215;10 or 600&#215;2 &#8212; something like that). When asked why he did it, without hesitation he said, &#8220;I was feeling reckless.&#8221;
  
_Edit: The back of the shirt has the classic 70sBig.com logo._

I became friends with one of my professors from college named Dr. Dan Czech. Dr. Czech is an interesting person; he has been to 57 countries teaching and coaching baseball camps, has consulted with countless professional athletes, and is fascinated with social dynamics and human interaction. His experience gives him a unique view point on competition, perseverance, and success. Recently Shawn and I met DC for dinner (Shawn has been mentioned in these posts: [first][2], [second][3], and [third][4].

As someone who has been able to meet and travel this great land of ours, I have interacted with some top echelant people. Needless to say, my 4 hours with Justin will go down as some of the best hours I have had in a very long time. Justin brough the following to the experience:

> -a knowledge base of the psychological mastering of cheesecake factory representatives
  
> -an ability to eat 2,000 calories in one setting
  
> -a humor to make my throat and stomach hurt for 2 days (_Editor&#8217;s Note: From laughing._)
  
> -the mental stamina to last 4 hours with Shawn Owen (_Editor&#8217;s Note: A significant accomplishment._)

> I am mightily impressed with this and thus have decided to partake some knowledge dropping from 70s Big. I look forward to learning from you guys.
