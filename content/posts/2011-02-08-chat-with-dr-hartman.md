The 70&#8217;s Big Chat is scheduled for this evening at 5:00 PM EST, and we&#8217;ll be joined by Dr. Michael Hartman again. Usually the chat is a free-for-all that is an open forum to questions. Dr. Hartman would take some questions regarding weightlifting and beer, and I&#8217;d answer things the best I could.

Today&#8217;s chat will be a little different. Today is a live Q&A about Dr. Hartman&#8217;s new e-book &#8220;The Next 8 Weeks&#8230;&#8221; that I featured yesterday. Dr. Hartman will be taking questions regarding this book, but I encourage any of you current or future weightlifters to join as well. We&#8217;ll also have a topic discussion on **Weightlifting Strength vs General Strength**. Come with questions or just to spectate, but it&#8217;ll be an informative session.
