**Donate**
  
I started this site in September of 2009 and have aimed to entertain and educate readers. The site has existed completely for free during that span, and I hope you&#8217;ve gotten something out of it. Things are a little tight financially right now, so if you are willing to donate a few dollars via the PayPal button below, it would be very appreciated.
  
No donation is too small, and again, I appreciate it very much.
  


**Projects**
  
I&#8217;m working on some projects to further your education and entertainment. One version is a short podcast of interviews with various people, whether coaches or trainees. Another project is a writing project that will help at least 75% of you in how you program and train. New t-shirt designs will also be released today (I&#8217;ll update in this post) and completely new t-shirts will also be on the way. There&#8217;s a lot to be excited about if you&#8217;re a fan of 70&#8217;s Big.
  

  
In the mean time, amuse yourself with this video of Bjorn from Sweden:

**Question of the Day**
  
What&#8217;s better: fried chicken or barbecued chicken?
  

  
**New Shirts**
  
There are two new shirts available on the [70&#8217;s Big Store][4]. The first is a new version of the brown Throwback shirt, now reprinted in navy. It looks sexy.

The second places the Reckless shirt on a red shirt &#8212; the color of blood and rage.
