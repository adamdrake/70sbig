I&#8217;m working on those &#8220;other projects&#8221;, and this post seemed extremely relevant. Courtney is 5&#8217;2&#8243;, 125 lbs, is from Reston, VA, and can deadlifted 332lbs. As they say around the interwebz, that&#8217;s &#8220;mega hawt&#8221;. Her goals for this year are to deadlift 350 and squat 275.
  

  
Here&#8217;s a video of her doing a 290 pound sled drag. She had 135 lbs. in bumpers on there, but it wasn&#8217;t heavy enough so her friend jumped on to make it 290. No big deal.

What we have here is a cute girl who deadlifts over 300 pounds, and wants to deadlift and squat more. Courtney said in her e-mail,

> I hope you will share this on your site as I work to show women just how much fun strength training can be! Hopefully I will be making those lift goals in no time :)

Yes it&#8217;s true; stronger women are the best.
  


What have I got to say to those of you who aren&#8217;t significantly stronger than this girl? Step up your game, son.
