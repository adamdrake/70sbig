Here are two videos. The first is a quick vid I shot last night that talks about three very good stretches for a lifter who doesn&#8217;t stretch at all. Keeping your structures pliable and loose will be important for preventing injury as well as being able to do non-lifting things (use your imagination). For more mobility work, see Kelly Starrett&#8217;s Mobility WOD series on YouTube (two of the stretches are referenced a lot by Kelly).

The second video is from my friends Jacob and Hom in California. Jacob sports a gnarly-ass beard while they eat a gigantic, 70&#8217;s Big burrito. California may be weird, but damn they have good food.

**Question of the Day**
  
What do you eat for breakfast every day?
