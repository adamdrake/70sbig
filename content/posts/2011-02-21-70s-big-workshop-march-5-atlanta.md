There will be a 70&#8217;s Big Workshop in Atlanta on March 5, 2011. This new and improved workshop features lectures on getting bigger, stronger, and more conditioned with a large emphasis on programming. Attendees will get handouts of program outlines and guidelines. There will be a lift around session to get form checks/tweaks, learn a new lift, or discuss coaching practice and theory. Then we&#8217;ll go to dinner and eat a bunch of animals (alive and dead) while drinking ale. Interested? **[CLICK HERE][1]** for the schedule and more information.
