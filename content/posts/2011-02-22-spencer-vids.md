**Squatland Yard**
  
My friend Spencer is an editor at the sports site [Every Day Should Be Saturday][1] and a contributor to [SB Nation][2]. He&#8217;s been to one of the 70&#8217;s Big Workshops, has written **[this article][3]** about AC, has a gnarly mustache, and refers to himself as &#8220;more of a pack mule&#8221; regarding conditioning. In other words, he&#8217;s a cool dude.
  

  
A couple weeks ago he asked me some questions that came from his readers for the first episode of his off-topic podcast, **[Squatland Yard][4]**. What resulted is a random, amusing podcast. Enjoy.
  

  
**Reckless**
  
[Chris][5] and [Mike][6] train hard and are reckless. They are both on advanced stages of some kind of TM programming that we&#8217;ve tweaked together. Here are a few solid vids.
  

  
Here&#8217;s Chris squatting 610&#215;2 &#8212; more than his old max.

Here is Mike pulling a solid 545&#215;3. He pulled around 580 last summer, and I expect him to break the 600 mark at Militar Nationals in San Antonio. <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="368" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yPMsxvhqmrU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  

  
Additionally, Mike&#8217;s brother is a jacked, deep voiced dude who is getting back into training. He smokes an easy 475&#215;3 squat here:

Boom.
