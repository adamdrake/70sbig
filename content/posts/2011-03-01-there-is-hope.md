Generally speaking, I don&#8217;t hate groups of people. But I sure dislike them. For instance, it bothers me that girls and women nowadays are attracted to effeminate, poonish males. Masculinity is a dying trait in today&#8217;s world; I weep for the future. What happened to the man&#8217;s man? What happened to grizzled, yet affectionate men? What happened to flannel? Some of you may find this hard to believe, but there are actually &#8220;males&#8221; out there that are mistaken for a woman! I&#8217;ve always said, &#8220;It should be a primary goal of either sex to never be mistaken for the opposite sex.&#8221; I stand by that.
  

  
Thankfully, I heard two stories yesterday that gave me hope. The first referenced a female who lost interest in a guy because he &#8220;loved to sing&#8221;. When asked about it, she replied, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t want to date anyone that is less masculine than I am.&#8221; This girl ain&#8217;t a butch, either.
  

  
The second story is from [Jacob Tsypkin][1]. Jacob asked for a class of milk at a coffee shop, and his milk was served in a wine glass.

Then the girls at the counter were complimenting his beard (see how gnarly it is in this video). He thanked them and said, &#8220;Most girls don&#8217;t like beards.&#8221; The girl replied in deadpan fashion, &#8220;Well, you see, I like men. Not boys.&#8221;
  

  
There is hope, yet.
  

  
Do any of you have hope that women prefer masculinity and ruggedness over skinny, shorn poons?
