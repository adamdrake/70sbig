Every day millions of people are doing silly-ass shit in gyms across the world. One of these things includes wearing Vibram Five Fingers to the gym. For those of you who aren&#8217;t Californians, CrossFitters, or the outdoorsy type, they look like this:

I&#8217;ll point out that most people think that these things are&#8230;not straight. I can see how they&#8217;d say that, but they are useful for outdoorsy shit like rock climbing, kayaking, or wearing to the beach (I know because I was gifted a pair, and I have worn them doing these things).
  
_Edit: When I tried explaining this to my girlfriend, who hates the Vibrams, I said, &#8220;Well, they are useful for some things&#8211;&#8221; She interrupted me and said, &#8220;What? When you want to put your toe in someone&#8217;s ass?&#8221;_
  

  
Some people wear them for running (those people are vegetarians or have other unrewarding characteristics such as &#8212; and this is a direct quote from my girlfriend &#8212; &#8220;armpit hair or a huge bush&#8221;). I think that wearing them for running is taking the &#8220;functional&#8221; shit way too far, not to mention running in them is clearly less safe (consider the environment, and accept the fact that the vast majority of people can&#8217;t POSE correctly).
   
&#8220;Ohhh, but what about the functionality of aborigines running properly?&#8221;
  
Yawn.
  

  
Look, POSE running is good and more efficient. Getting all crazy and doing it in Vibrams indicates you don&#8217;t have anything else important to do. Does [Brian MacKenzie][2] wear Vibrams when he races? No. He doesn&#8217;t.
  

  
More importantly, Vibrams shouldn&#8217;t be worn to workout, ESPECIALLY when lifting. Jesus, I see people wearing them to squat in and it makes my teeth hurt. When I see them attempting the Olympic lifts, I have a seizure on the spot. &#8220;Functionality&#8221; isn&#8217;t about trying to do things like the australopithecus did &#8220;because we evolved that way&#8221;. Functionality is a by product of getting strong, and to get strong efficiently, you wear appropriate footwear. You can run into a host of foot problems by stupidly wearing the Vibrams to lift in. Not only is getting injured not a sport, it&#8217;s not fucking functional either. If some shit head can only squat 250 wearing Vibrams, and this other not-so-shithead can squat 450 by wearing a belt and shoes &#8212; both of which will help make him stronger, a trait that directly contributes to real world events &#8212; then he is much more functional than the first guy. And if he isn&#8217;t conditioned from a respiratory/vascular perspective for the &#8220;worst case scenario hysteria people&#8221;, then he can get more conditioned faster because he is strong.
  

  
Vibrams Five Fingers are horrible to lift in. If some fitness ass-burger is telling you otherwise, then you now know they are a burger made of ass. Mechanically they create more problems and don&#8217;t solve any, injuries are prevalent (hey, let&#8217;s jump and stomp our feet without shoes on with an additional 100+ pounds in our hands &#8212; good idea, right?), and they don&#8217;t have any merit for optimal strength training. If any of you wear Vibrams, then you should have the money to spring for a cheap pair of lifting shoes. Save the Vibrams for what they were made for: wearing them outdoors when no one is looking.
