This weekend I watched [Rio Bravo][1], starring John Wayne. The first memory I had of Wayne was at the movie ride in MGM Studios. The ride&#8217;s boat rounds a corner, and a mechanized John Wayne is sitting on a horse talking some kind of smack (Side note: I can&#8217;t remember if this was before or after the Lieutenant Ripley scene where she was against the wall, panting quickly when one of the aliens bursts out of the wall and scared the living shit out of me at six years old). I really hadn&#8217;t seen any of his movies either; they were before my time.

John Wayne injected the world with masculinity. His gritty determination and &#8220;take no shit&#8221; attitude embody what 70&#8217;s Big stands for. Whether dealing with sassy women or no-good, dirty criminals, Wayne is stern, gruff and righteous. If John Wayne was before your time, I suggest checking out one of his movies. Here is a [preview for Rio Bravo][3]. More on Rio Bravo:

  That <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053221/">description </a> fails to mention a good lookin&#8217; <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=angie+dickinson&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1600&bih=704">Angie Dickinson</a> in her prime.<br />

John Wayne was an icon because of his distinctive voice, walk, and size; he was bigger than most actors and in his movies he often dwarfs his supporting cast (especially when he&#8217;s busy hitting them in the face with the barrel of his rifle). His leathery face may not be pretty, but John Wayne is definitely a hard-ass.
