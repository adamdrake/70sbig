There have been some posts on what music readers like to listen to when lifting, but [this one][1] is the only one worth reading. As I&#8217;m typing this, I&#8217;m listening to Alice Cooper&#8217;s &#8220;[Welcome To My Nightmare][2]&#8221; &#8212; go ahead and click it if you want the full effect of reading this post (if you don&#8217;t like YouTube, go to Playlist.com and search it).
  

  
Music can help act as a catalyst for the release of adrenaline, but it can also have a calming effect. It&#8217;s incredibly useful to inject a mood when emotion and intensity are low. However, I do believe that music can be a crutch. It denies the necessity to learn how to get psyched up without it, and it also neglects learning how to get relaxed without it. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s very useful when training <del datetime="2011-03-15T14:05:14+00:00">and drinking</del>.

Personally, I&#8217;m not impressed with the majority of music. I hate most mainstream music and most types of music. I prefer obvious displays of artistic ability, and that isn&#8217;t found within pop, emo, U2, or Creed. Additionally, lifters stereotypically prefer metal that has a guy screaming with a horrible guttural noise that is sorta like, but not necessarily the noise I make when I vomit. Again, I&#8217;m unimpressed. That doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t like metal or any other type of music; you can go ahead and assume that I not only am unimpressed with your favorite bands or songs, but that I hate them.
  

  
Hell, who gives a shit what I think? This post isn&#8217;t about what I do or don&#8217;t like, it&#8217;s about what _you_ like. Detail what your favorite type of training music is, and then what specific type of music or songs you prefer on your heavy or intense sets. To me, &#8220;training music&#8221; would be something that I would enjoy having on in the background during warm-ups or assistance exercises. That is a category that is different than what I consider &#8220;squat songs&#8221;, or songs that I listen to specifically for squatting really heavy. Post your favorites to the comments. Don&#8217;t hesitate to make fun of each other (it&#8217;s all in good fun).

I&#8217;ll go first:
  
Lately I&#8217;ve been in a gym that doesn&#8217;t have music playing at all, and I don&#8217;t use a music device. I psyche up without music, but last night I psyched up _thinking_ about Led Zeppelin&#8217;s **Achille&#8217;s Last Stand**, which is an awesome ten minute tune with some intense guitar and drum pieces (and is one of my favorite songs overall). I&#8217;ve squatted to **When the Levee Breaks** by Zeppelin, **I&#8217;m a Man** by Chicago (the first album is solid, down hill after the early days), and most songs from Guns N&#8217; Roses Appetite for Destruction album, namely **Welcome to the Jungle**, **Nighttrain**, and especially **Out Ta Get Me**. With the exception of Sweet Child O&#8217; Mine, that whole album is solid. Most Led Zeppelin is, but I don&#8217;t enjoy their stuff that is overplayed on the radio and opt for the more bluesy stuff like **Since I&#8217;ve Been Loving You**, but it&#8217;s more for laid back training. Also, I really like Billy Idol for lifting heavy. I shit you not, **Rebel Yell** and **White Wedding** get me amped. Other than that, I like most upbeat classic and 80&#8217;s rock to have in the background of training. I haven&#8217;t heard much metal outside of 80&#8217;s metal, but I enjoy Metallica&#8217;s early stuff and Motorhead.
