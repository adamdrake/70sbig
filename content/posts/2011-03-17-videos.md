Traveling today. Enjoy these videos.
  

  
Chris is getting ready for a meet in about a month. He squatted a reported easy 630 the other day (he told me he could have doubled it). I had him pull a heavier single at 640. Here it is:

Mike is competing this weekend at USAPL Military Nationals. His brother Alex is getting nice and strong again. Here&#8217;s 485&#215;3.

Chris doesn&#8217;t like that he can&#8217;t bench well, but in January of 2009 he had a pretty serious shoulder injury in an Oly meet that probably should have had surgical attention. Instead I helped him rehab and he&#8217;s pushing towards a 400 bench. Here&#8217;s a paused single at 375.
