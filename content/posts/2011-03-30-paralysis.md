Barbell lifting is an interesting thing. Everyone here may not agree on what it means to &#8220;get good&#8221; at it. If a guy who walks in off the street can pull 600 pounds, does that mean he&#8217;s good at lifting? If a different guy has to put the work in to squat around 350 for reps, yet he&#8217;s done it with patience, persistence, and pretty good technique, does that mean he is worse since he is almost half as strong as the first guy?
  

  
Barbell lifting is a process. Whatever genetic ability a person has, what they do with it is important. The process is a collection of doing things right each workout as well as over time &#8212; simplified to technique and programming respectively. The problem, especially for a new trainee, is knowing what is &#8220;right&#8221;. Sources are varied across the internet to include bodybuilding, powerlifting, weightlifting, powerbuilding, DoggCrapp, MadCow, Lance Uppercut, Rock Strongbow, and Rusty Trombone. The good news is that the majority of these variations of programs (or frightening sexual techniques) are all derived from simplicity.
  

  
Athenaeus gave the first lesson of simple strength training by creating the myth of Milo of Croton. Milo merely lifted a little more today than he did yesterday; small, yet consistent increments were how his strength were developed. Nowadays we use barbells instead of farm animals (the desire for &#8220;same day cow&#8221; has grown) and we know that squatting, pressing, benching, and deadlift are how we establish strength and muscularity. We can make similar consistent process by lifting a bit more each time we lift. **Most new trainees, including the skinny and weak ones, don&#8217;t understand that it&#8217;s an accumulation of strength work over time that makes people strong, not trying to increase the load as quickly as possible in a matter of months.** Most soft tissue injuries are associated with pushing too much too soon. Remember that since Milo&#8217;s bull increased in small increments of weight each day, he never overreached. The bull didn&#8217;t increase 20 pounds suddenly, and Milo didn&#8217;t have to reset by removing the testicles (there is no correlation between lack of testicles and resetting, stay on task, sir).

Additionally, Milo&#8217;s programming wasn&#8217;t complicated. He just moved his future meal around and wrestled (six time Olympian [and more][1]). Programming with barbells doesn&#8217;t have to get complicated&#8230;in the beginning. But this is the point. If you are new to lifting (have done it less than a year or two), worrying about program is a waste of your time since you don&#8217;t require complicated program to have success. **Dan John** is excellent at creating simple strength and/or conditioning programs; he is your friend. Maintain simplicity over time and strength and muscularity will develop.
  

  
Here is a simple guideline of barbell lifts to establish a base of strength and muscularity.
  

  
&#8211; Squat 2x/week
  
&#8211; Deadlift 1x/week
  
&#8211; Press and Bench 1 or 2x/week each
  
&#8211; Chin-ups and pull-ups 2x/week
  

  
By virtue of doing these things every week over time, you will grow stronger. &#8220;Strong&#8221; doesn&#8217;t indicate a load on the bar, it more so indicates the structure and capability of your body. Beginners won&#8217;t benefit from hitting a maximal set of deadlift before their structures have developed to handle such an endeavor ([QED][2]). Instead, consistent and patient increases over time will lay the foundation. It isn&#8217;t complicated; don&#8217;t analyze it to death. If the body or structures are feeling fatigued and tired, it&#8217;s painfully logical to reduce the workout or rest. In a beginner, halving their previous workout will still give them stimulation to continue the &#8220;accumulated workload concept&#8221;, yet not cause as much stress.
  

  
There is far too much over analysis in programming, especially for beginners. Keep it simple and consistent and ensure the body is fresh for each workout. I promise the strength will come. In Part 2 I will discuss how lifters over analyze their technique.
