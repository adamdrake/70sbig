Folks, we talk a lot about barbell training on this site, but we ignore too many other forms of training out there. For instance, look at the utility in this equipment:

First, they save you $125. What you are saving it on is immaterial. Instead, look at the set-up. Yes, the actor may be a bit smaller than us, but look at his attire. He looks great! And he&#8217;s so functional &#8212; the shaking he experiences on the ring push-ups means he&#8217;s building functionality that can&#8217;t be attained anywhere else.
  

  
As far as programs go, P90X is magnificent. If you go to 1:48 in this video and watch the progress pictures, you&#8217;ll notice how P90X magnificently removed body hair from this subject. Magnificent ;-)

Lastly, a lot of you have been thinking about trying out Olympic lifting. I advise you, good sirs, to obtain optimal form with PVC pipe before attempting it with a bar. If you can&#8217;t do it with PVC, how can you do it with a load?

I am so excited to announce that it is PR Friday! I caution you &#8220;heavy eaters&#8221; out there to not post today, let&#8217;s focus on healthy eating in this PR Friday. The only people that can post are lifters who eat less than 50 grams of carbohydrates a day and squat more than 500 pounds. Also, if you don&#8217;t do everything I say, you can&#8217;t post here either. Oh, and you have to call me High Chancellor when you do it. Or else.
