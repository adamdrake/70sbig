_Recap by Mike_
  
I’ll just go ahead and start with Thursday night, two nights prior to the meet. Chris, Alex, and I went out to eat after Alex got off of work, and didn’t get home until around 10:30 pm. Of course, none of us were packed. For various reasons, like always, we were packing last minute. All of us went to bed after midnight and woke up around 5:00 a.m. Plenty of sleep right? We all felt like crap. We hit the road around 6:10 am, and made it to our first checkpoint, breakfast. Chris’ girlfriend suggested we eat at a particular truck stop, and the breakfast ended up being excellent. But much like a normal stop for us, it took an eternity. We should have been in and out in 30 minutes, but it took well over an hour. You will notice by the end that there is nothing we do quickly; it always takes an hour and a half. We made it down to Plano to pick Brent up almost at our planned of 9:30 am. No worries, we’d lose time shortly.
  

  
Somehow we ended up at Central Market around 10:30 am, when they open for lunch. In and out, right? Negative. Somehow, between looking at the vast selection of beer, coffee, and food, while utilizing the restroom one time each, we left after it was already noon. How? I’m not really sure. Needless to say our trip would take long than expected. I’m not sure how to describe the ride to San Antonio, but it can only be described as exhausting. One day, when we all have children, none of us will be surprised by their tireless banter. Why? It’ because being around anymore than two of us at a time (Justin, Chris, Mike, Brent, Alex, or AC) is a “soul-draining experience.” (Gant, 2010) If you have kids and they’ve ever missed their nap, and then ate a bunch of sugar cookies, after which they took down a case of Red Bull, you understand our pain. It takes a significant amount of endurance to put up with any of us for more than an hour. Just ask the people that sat near us at the meet and subsequently walked away mid conversation.
  

  
About an hour outside of Plano we decided to stop at Rudy’s. A number of people had recommended it to us, and we were eager to try it. Man am I sure pissed we did. The sausage, brisket (although ridiculously fatty), and potato salad were pretty good, while the pork loin, turkey, sauces, and price left something to be desired. No thanks, I’ll stick with the Cracker Barrel for every meal (you shall see why later). Once we got to San Antonio, coated in sweat, we headed up to the room, and started to “relax” (relax for us is different than relax for most people, we continue trolling, just perhaps with a TV on, or while laying down). I still needed to “train” and find the meet venue, and then get back to “rest” for the meet.
  

  
Brent and I left the hotel sometime around 7:30pm., while Chris and Alex caught up on the Master’s (I will now point out Brent believes golf isn’t a sport). We made it to the meet venue after getting lost for half an hour (there were no signs of course, nor were we expecting any, we just thought “hey, maybe it’s in this building that has cars in front of it”). We got in there just before 8:00pm, and they were just about to close up shop. Needless to say, Brent was told to check back in in the morning, and I was met with an incredulous look when I asked “Can I squat really quickly? I’m not kidding…”
  

  
With that, we were off to find a gym. With my nearly dead GPS we found a 24 hour gym 20 miles away and made haste. It was already after 8:00pm, and we still needed to “train” (Brent had to do his MWod) and eat. I say “train” because when I got to the “gym” there was no squat rack, and only a 32mm bar lying on the ground. There wasn’t even a bench not meant for a Smith machine. FML. I proceeded to warm up and decided to leg press. I don’t think I’ve leg pressed in nearly two years. Well, I had to do something. I did a few heavy sets of five and called it a day. Then I decided to try and pull with straps, since it was a 32mm bar, and I didn’t have chalk. I pulled a single at 495 and called it good. I didn’t really care; I just decided I’d pull heavy this week. The highlight of the “training” session was Brent say “Oooo 495 for a single huh? Got some good work in? That’s a legit training session.”
  

  
After leaving this “gym” we drove back with my phone nearly dead, and it died exactly as we were pulling up to the hotel. At least something worked right. I think we got back a little after 10:00pm, and of course Chris and Alex needed to eat. I say Alex needed to eat, but truthfully, he was so close to not making weight, that he didn’t want to eat. Alex was “blocked up” for a few days prior to the meet, due to the fact that he wasn’t eating quite as much fiber/starches/etc, in order to make weight. Right before we left to go eat my brother told me if he was heavy in the morning, he was going to hop on the treadmill. We exchanged some words about why it wasn’t a good idea to run the morning of a competition, and agreed he’d lift 275 if he didn’t make weight.
  

  
Once we left the hotel, we still didn’t know what to eat. I think five minutes into the ride, after making our first circle, Chris said something to the effect of “good tired, it’s fine, it’s not like I’m competing in the morning or anything.” We eventually found a taco place (we all decided before hand that we didn’t want Mexican food) and just settled. It wasn’t the worst mistake ever, but I think the beans were between 6-8 years old, and the rice came from the bottom of a 55 gallon drum full of floor wax. The highlight of this portion of the tale was when Chris and I went to throw out our trash, and I thought “man this fajita skillet makes the tray freakin’ heavy”. I threw out my garbage, and then tried to figure out where the skillet went. The conversation that followed went something like this “Chris, where’ you’d you put your skillet?” He looked back and forth between me and the garbage can with inquiring eyes, and we immediately departed. As we left I told Chris that tomorrow there would be news of how a scalding hot skillet set the garbage on fire, and burnt the building to the ground, but that was a tomorrow problem. Our goal as a team is to always leave a place better than when we found it. Mission accomplished.
  

  
We finally made it back to the hotel around midnight, and decided we should go to sleep. You know, given the fact that we had to be awake for a marathon, I mean powerlifting competition, only 6 hours later. But I’ll keep you in suspense.
