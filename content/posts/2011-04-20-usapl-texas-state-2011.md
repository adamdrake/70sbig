_Still adding links below to the recaps_
  
Some of the 70&#8217;s Big crew competed in the USAPL Texas State Meet again this year. Mike competed at USAPL Military Nationals a couple of weeks before, so he handled Brent, Alex (his brother), and Chris at the meet. He wanted to do a write up for each portion, and they are linked below.
  

  
**[The Ride Down][1]**
  
The ride from Wichita Falls to San Antonio was arguably eventful, but more so because of the lack of organization. Mike tells an amusing story of the ride.
  

  
**[Brent][2]**
  
Brent ended squatting with a meet PR (and matching a gym PR) of 210kg (463 lbs) weighing around 162. He missed his third bench, and hit all three deadlifts finishing at 200kg (441 lbs) on the last one (he was unimpressed). I want to point out that the dickhead did clean and jerks two days before the meet at 265 pounds&#8230;with iron plates. He clearly didn&#8217;t make any attempt to peak for this meet.

**[Alex][3]**
  
This was Alex&#8217;s first meet, and came out 8/9 with a 242.5kg (533 lbs) squat, an easy 165kg (363 lbs) bench, and an easy 227.5kg (500 lbs) deadlift (Mike probably held him back, wanting him to pull 500 for the first time).

**[Chris][4]**
  
Chris had an awesome meet. We&#8217;ve talked a lot on tweaking his program and peaking his training for this meet, and we also talked extensively on what attempts to make on each lift. The only hiccup was missing the third attempt bench by 2.5kg because he barely missed it, but that is more so attributed to the not-great meet conditions (they had 90 lifters and one platform, so Alex and Chris didn&#8217;t start lifting until late afternoon and finished close to 9 at night). Overall, I think we did a very good job of implementing an advanced Texas Method style program, tapered it well, and chose the attempts well.
  

   
He went 8/9, squatted an overall PR of 292.5kg (644 lbs), missed his last bench but meet PR&#8217;d with 165kg (363 lbs) on the second attempt, and deadlifted an overall PR of 300kg (661 lbs). All raw and drug-free of course. He then destroyed several villages.

Good job to Mike for handling the three lifters &#8212; it&#8217;s never an easy thing. Mike was apparently more tired after doing that then when he actually lifts. I&#8217;ll make sure and be there for all of them at nationals later this year. Oh, and thanks to Mike for the write ups and I think he and Alex made the vids.
