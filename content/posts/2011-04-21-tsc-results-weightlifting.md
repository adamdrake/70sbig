Thanks to all the participants and congratulations to MaceJunas (Men&#8217;s Elite winner), tommcadam (Men&#8217;s open winner), and mthornell (Women&#8217;s Open winner). Also congratulations to Men&#8217;s Elite runner up Antigen &#8212; who organized this 70&#8217;s Big TSC and compiled all the results &#8212; for tying an all-time TSC record of 24 pull-ups with a 10kg load. I believe Antigen was at an organized TSC event, so he had some strict judging. 

## Weightlifting, Squats

Glenn Pendlay joined the 70&#8217;s Big Chat the other night for longer than he probably wanted to. He had some interesting comments on &#8220;macro weightlifting&#8221; &#8212; or things that concern the sport as a whole and how we compare with the rest of the world. One topic in particular was this notion that American weightlifting coaches don&#8217;t focus on strength. Glenn kindly pointed out in [this post][2] that it isn&#8217;t the case. Max Aita aimed to do 5&#215;5 with 260kg. That&#8217;s fucking 572 lbs. Glenn points out that &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t quite make it, but ends up doing 27 total reps in 7 total sets, rep counts were 4,5,4,4,4,3,3.&#8221; The video gets fucking intense, so watch all the way through.

As an aside, here&#8217;s [Donny Shankle push-pressing][3] 130kg for 11 reps from behind the neck. That&#8217;s 286 pounds. More on this topic in a future podcast with Glenn.
