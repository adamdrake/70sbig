The summer is open for doing workshops around the country and potentially the world. There are now two different kinds of workshops that 70&#8217;s Big presents:
  

  
1. Programming workshops
  
These workshops have a focus on learning the fundamentals of programming strength, conditioning, and then a combination thereof. These workshops also include a &#8220;lift around&#8221; where attendees can get form checks, learn a new movement, or practice coaching.
  

  
2. Lifting workshops
  
This type of workshop is more focused on the lifting. After a brief fundamentals lecture on equipment (especially belt use), mechanics, and prehab/rehab/mobility for lifters, the day is focused on lifting. All lifts are fair game: squat, press, bench, deadlift, snatch, and clean and jerk. The gym owner and/or attendees will dictate what lifts are included, but the stock plan is to get work on the strength lifts.
  

  
It&#8217;s also possible to combine these workshops for a two day weekend event. If you are interested in hosting a workshop, e-mail [Justin@70sbig.com][1]. If you want to attend a workshop and want to campaign for 70&#8217;s Big to come to your city, shoot an e-mail (it will help if you have a place in mind or know someone who is interested in hosting). Please note that tank-tops, facial hair, aviator sunglasses, beer, and meat will be a constant presence in these workshops.
  

  
**Denver, June 8**
  
There will be a Lifting Workshop in Denver, CO at [CrossFit LoDo][2] on Saturday, June 8th, 2011. A full schedule with details will be released soon.
  

  
**Australia**
  
I&#8217;ve been working with my mate on getting a workshop in Sydney, Australia. We are going to tentatively plan a date in July, but need to gauge interest before spending money on travel. We will have a &#8220;registration&#8221; (with no payment) process until June. If we don&#8217;t get enough people by then, we&#8217;ll call it off. If we do, then we&#8217;ll finalize the schedule for the workshop a month later. E-mail [Justin@70sbig.com][1] if you are an Aussie who is interested.
  


## Videos You Should See

Most of these vids are old, but impressive. Weightlifting doesn&#8217;t get enough attention on this site.

AC and I were laughing about this chick&#8217;s vids. Feel free to pick it apart. We aren&#8217;t just assholes, so tell me what is wrong with her teaching, the lift, and the mechanics. Then go back to being an asshole.
