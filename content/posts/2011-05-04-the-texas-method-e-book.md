All readers on 70&#8217;s Big want to get strong, and almost all of them want to get big _and_ strong. They will use a linear progression like Starting Strength or the Greyskull LP, yet seem sort of lost as to what to do next. The Texas Method is typically recommended, yet there isn&#8217;t a clear guide on how to transition into it, how to properly progress it, how to tweak it as you advance, or how to use it for sub-goals like weightlifting and swollertrophy. Until now.
