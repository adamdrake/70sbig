I talk with Johnny Pain of StrengthVillain.com about the origins of Greskull Barbell, the unique attitude of his gym, the Greyskull Linear Progression, body image in training, general programming, and Bony stories (which are worth a listen by itself). JP is amusingly tired in the beginning, but he perks up. Talking to him is always a learning and entertaining experience. Bony for President!
