_Today&#8217;s post by AC_
  

  
My good friend Ryan plays right tackle at Vanderbilt and is freakishly big in stature and freakishly strong as well. His attitude embodies the 70&#8217;s Big lifestyle.
  

  
Ryan is the Offensive Tackle for the Vanderbilt Commodores. He weighs in at a whopping 315 and stands 6&#8217;5&#8243;&#8230;he is one large man. Don&#8217;t let this giant fool you though, he&#8217;s as gentle as they come off the field. On the field Ryan becomes the &#8220;Seymonster&#8221; (His other official name is the Scratchetory Raper. He D.J.&#8217;s on the side) .
  

  
Throughout his life he viewed sports as a gateway to a successful life. He started playing baseball at six years old and has also played golf, soccer, football and has wrestled. He credits the lifting program at Camden County High School to unlocking his full training potential as a football player.

Early in Ryan&#8217;s high school career he wrestled at 171 lbs. and had little experience in the gym. By the time his senior year rolled around he walked through the halls of Camden&#8217;s high school at 6&#8217;5&#8243;, 240 lbs. Ryan&#8217;s 1 RM&#8217;s were: 340 Bench, 375 Squat, and a 350 Deadlift. These numbers aren&#8217;t record breaking by any means, but for Ryan it was a huge leap forward for him and his career on the field.
  

  
Ryan has a year left at Vanderbilt but is still getting better, stronger, and faster every day he practices and trains. His lifting goals include squatting 600+ and benching 500+, which would make him more badass than he already is. I mean fuck, he&#8217;s huge. I&#8217;ve personally seen him play around with 395 for reps on the bench press.
  

  
Seymonster also is an avid Nazi Zombies player (_Editor&#8217;s Note: Call of Duty, of course). He visits on occasion and about 12 of the 72 hours are spent sitting on the couch slaying those bastard zombies. They always seem to kill Ryan first (maybe he has a more delicious brain&#8230;Rob is a good teammate too). All I can say about Ryan is that he is hilarious, an incredible friend, and a bad mamma jamma on the field. Look for him on Sundays in the near future.
  

  
He made this video for all you guys:
