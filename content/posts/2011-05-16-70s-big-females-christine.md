She has competed in a figure competition yet has transitioned into strength training and powerlifting. Her site ranges from ramblings to powerlifting, from training philosophy to female body image. Christine is, yet again, a prime example of a girl who is strong and looks great as a result of lifting weights.
  
Christine is 5&#8217;2&#8243; and currently 140 lbs. (but cutting a bit of weight); not exactly skinny. While she has a musculature physique, she is certainly not in danger of nuclear levels of &#8220;bulkiness&#8221; that most women seem to be terrified of when discussing weight training. 

Here is a video from Christine&#8217;s most recent powerlifting meet in which she grinds out a third attempt squat at 260 lbs.

    Strong girls can do pull-ups anywhere

Christine missed her third attempt deadlift at 292 in that meet (an issue with her set up), but has pulled 290 in training recently. Here&#8217;s a routine set of five she did in the gym:

I hope that the continued features on strong girls like Christine helps the naysayers realize that lifting weights develops strength and the optimal female figure. It&#8217;s my sincerest hope that women don&#8217;t think that emaciation or skinniness is the female archetype, but instead aspire to be physically strong and capable women. Strength training helps generate an ideal metabolism and refines musculature that augments the lovely female body. Male readers, I urge you to share this with your girlfriends, wives, friends, family, and co-workers, but do so in a respectful, non-threatening way.
