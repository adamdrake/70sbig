Observe this public service announcement from Spencer at California Strength:
  
(this was supposed to be a PR set of five)
  

  
{{< youtube bQcT8gFiiNc >}}
  

  
I want to point out that the red and black NWO has been dead for years, but Spencer doesn&#8217;t give any shits; Wolfpack 4 Life. Secondly, Spencer was all set to squat 235kg (517 lbs. for you uncultured Americans) for a set of five. And then he went insane AND FUCKING DOUBLED IT UP. He&#8217;s the type of guy who says, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, that&#8217;s not nearly enough pancakes.&#8221; He&#8217;s the type of guy who lays down six aces in a friendly poker game. He&#8217;s the type of guy who is still shredding the air guitar after the song is over. He doesn&#8217;t [give a shit][1].
  

  
It&#8217;s not like he doesn&#8217;t care about getting better or getting stronger; he clearly cares about that. But he&#8217;s not worrying about the minutiae in the moment and when it&#8217;s go time, he fucking brings it. Trying to hit a weight, and then summoning all your energy to fucking annihilate it are two very different things. When you&#8217;re hitting a set, get reckless.
  

  
Did you watch the ending of that video? Spencer isn&#8217;t allowed to take dbol, so he makes his own&#8230;by being a fucking man.
