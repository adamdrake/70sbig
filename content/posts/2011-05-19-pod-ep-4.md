This podcast begin as a basic podcast on how JP would progress the deadlift and turned into a very interesting and useful programming podcast. You know someone is a good programmer when they are asked about a program, they ask an avalanche of questions like
  

  
How old, tall, and heavy are you?
  
What are your lifts at?
  
What program have you been doing?
  
How many times a week do you train?
  
What is the set/rep scheme?
  

  
Programming is an organic art. Listen to this podcast to learn how to do it effectively.
