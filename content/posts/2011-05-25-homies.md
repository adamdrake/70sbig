Ben hit a 171kg at the NorCal Open on Sunday. His meet PR was 165. He opened at 166.

Ben missed 175 after. He [snatched 140][1] in the meet (go [here][2] for his write up).
  

  
In other news, Brent is still being an asshole and snatching with iron plates. He had an overall PR of 235 pounds recently. In his words: should note that those are not bumpers, setting is a globo gym, and this is me not giving a fucking shit.

The last time he was snatching around that weight, he was weighing 180 or so. In this video, he&#8217;s 164. Not a big deal, really.
  
What happens after snatching with iron plates? Clean and jerking with iron plates, of course.

May as well [deadlift right after][3], slow touch and go. Make sure and read the info on this vid. Oh, and the shirt he&#8217;s wearing is a picture of an astronaut with the caption, “[Not all dreams can come true][4].”

Lastly, I posted this video a long time ago, but Ben recently re-posted this on his training log. [Ricky Bruch][5] is so awesome.
