I was up all night because a friend flipped their truck last night (they dusted themselves off and walked away with some scratches), hence the lack of a post. I&#8217;ll add something to the post in a bit.
  

  
There will be a chat tonight. Time unknown.
  

  
Talk about whatever in the comments.

RIP Ricky Bruch. He was a great man. ([LINK][1])
