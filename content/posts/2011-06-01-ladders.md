Hopefully the quick few words on [programming][1] the other day helped steer some of you in a better direction, whether you needed to get focused or expand your horizons. Today I want to talk about a set and rep scheme that has been around for a while, but may be interesting to some of the readers looking to tweak their programming.
  

  
There&#8217;s no way to tell who invented what and when, but Steve Shafley posted [a nice summary][2] on using ladders to increase strength in 2005 on [Power and Bulk][3]. The premise is using some kind of ladder to garner some volume (relatively speaking). The standard ladder example consists of sets of 1/2/3 (one rep, then a double, then a triple), and typically at least three ladders are done in a workout with a given exercise. In this kind of set up, all the reps of all the ladders shouldn&#8217;t be difficult. If you look at Shaf&#8217;s explanation, he used it three days a week for close grip bench and had some nice progress (although I want to point out that I don&#8217;t know his training history or preceding program to using the ladder method &#8212; remember, programming is relative to the individual). Shaf also points out that this method will relatively have higher volume and lower intensity.

Recently Dr. Hartman did a post on [playing around with ladders][4], citing the P&B post. Whereas Shaf found that the volume was what helped drive progress, Dr. Hartman used this the lower rep scheme to accumulate some volume with heavier loads.

&nbsp;

> I have capped my number of ladders at 3, so a typical ladder on Wednesday would be 1/2/3/1/2/3/1/2/3; 9 sets and 18 total reps. With the increased number of sets, and lower max reps per set, you are able to train at a heavier load than you could with a similar volume but different configuration (6&#215;3, 4&#215;4, etc.)

If you check out Hartman&#8217;s post, he had a nice little progression by using this method (he front squatted MF and back squatted on W). Both of these examples implement the set/rep scheme very differently, yet both garnered an improvement in strength. The similarities is that both of Shaf and Hartman used it to get some accumulated volume &#8212; each 1/2/3 ladder is six reps, and three to five ladders is 18 to 30 reps. Shaf used the method on one exercise, similar to a Russian-style of greasing the groove. Hartman used it on his back squats to break through a training plateau with heavier loads. Shaf&#8217;s goal was low fatigue on each set whereas Hartman wanted to push his ladders to reach into his 150kg 3RM realm:

> My progression was as follows: 120kg – 3 ladders, 130 – 3, 135 – 3, 140 – 2, 140 – 3, 145 – 2, 145 – 3, and this week 150kg – 3 ladders.

Whenever I read something new or are reminded of an old principle, I like to think how I can implement it into the style of programming I use. Most linear progressions are so basic that they don&#8217;t need to worry about ladders, yet ladders would be good to bring up a lacking strength and mass with Shaf&#8217;s accumulated workload style in someone that is beyond the LP necessity. Hartman&#8217;s higher intensity method would be more of a short term plateau buster &#8212; probably not something that would be used in the long run. However, the principle could be implemented in any program.
  

  
The S&C Program that I outlined could shift from a) a basic three sets of five rep scheme to b) a Greyskull three sets of five with the last set going for as many reps as possible, and then c) a ladder set-up that allows for more weight to be handled (higher intensity) with medium levels of volume (three 1/2/3 ladders = 18 reps). The &#8216;high intensity&#8217; ladder twist could potentially be used on a Volume Day for a [Texas Method][5] style program, but I wouldn&#8217;t use it on anyone unless they progress through the lower volume schemes I detailed in the e-book (and I still would only use it in limited situations). Any basic template could use a ladder set up if pertinent, and they could be cycled with other things like ascending/descending/sets across of doubles/triples/fives/tens, or rep target power building stuff. Basically it&#8217;s another shade of ink that a programming artist can use to paint a strong, powerful, well built man.
