I just [searched my site][1] to verify whether or not I ever made the claim that I wanted all my readers to look like &#8220;a big fucking shit bag&#8221;. Surprisingly, there were 72 results, yet none of them had anything to do with the phrase. I suppose most people garner their initial 70&#8217;s Big food advice from the Food FAQ&#8230;you know, that thing that hasn&#8217;t been updated since November of 2009 (followed by the ironic point that it will be updated frequently). My guess is that the primary thing that they see is the bowl of ice cream and brownies covered in magic shell.
  

  
_Egad! These 70&#8217;s Big folk are destroying their minds and body with non-Paleo malady!_
  
Yawn. The first 16 of the 19 pictures that are currently on the Food FAQ are pictures of meat (earmuffs), and lots of it. Aside from it being delicious and manly, it&#8217;s what anybody&#8217;s diet should be created around. A wise man once said, &#8220;First we get the khakis, then we get the chicks.&#8221;
  

  
70&#8217;s Big does not have any diet groupies and I don&#8217;t like zealots (they don&#8217;t have lips, Antigen &#8212; how can they speak?)
