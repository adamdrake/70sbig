[ExtremePullups.com][1] is having an internet pull-up challenge to see who can do the most pull-ups with a 45 pound plate ([see rules here][2]).
  

  
My buddy Antigen is participating in this event. In the following video, he does 21 reps at a body weight of 181.

Pretty damn impressive. Pull-up strength is something that I&#8217;ve been working on this year and I definitely see the utility in its carry over into other lifts like bench press and press. Weighted pull-ups also help build musculature in the lats, rear shoulder girdle, biceps, and forearms. They can be done once a week, or twice a week with the second session done with chin-ups (supinated grip). Typically you&#8217;ll be stronger with pull-ups than chin-ups, although when you start this may not be the case (it wasn&#8217;t when I started). Place pull-ups/chin-ups after other larger exercises. They can be done as the primary back work for the day, or after other exercises that stress the back (for example, I regularly do chin-ups after deadlifting on Friday).
  

  
There are some various ways to train them. Here is a quick synopsis:
  

  
1. A simple 3&#215;5 progression over time. I usually recommend this at first, especially if there isn&#8217;t a lot of weight being added.
  
2. Once the 3&#215;5 gets to the 50 pound mark, then one option is to drop and go for max reps with 25 pounds, and then go for max reps with body weight. I&#8217;ve hit 21 body weight pull-ups after several heavy sets of weighted work.
  
3. Saul told me this next tidbit, and he got it from Bill Starr. You would rotate through these every week.
  
a) 8RM
  
b) 5RM + -50lb rep out
  
c) 3RM + -50lb rep out
  
As you see, after the 5 and 3RM, you would drop 50 pounds and rep out at that weight.
  
4. This last portion is what Saul used to train his &#8220;45 lbs for reps&#8221; set. He simply did 3 sets of as many reps as he could with a 45lb plate. On the chin-up day, he rotated the options in #3.
  

  
These are four methods you can use in weighted pull-up programming with the first two progressions aimed at a beginner. Oh, one more thing: it helps if you do them in a tank-top.
