  If you are a fan of the 70&#8217;s Big Facebook Page, then you will have already seen this announcement. I&#8217;ve been working on a project with Dr. <a href="http://lonkilgore.com/">Lon</a> <a href="http://killustrated.com/">Kilgore</a> and <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/">Dr. Michael Hartman</a>. It&#8217;s a general fitness book called &#8220;FIT&#8221; and is a guide to make you exactly that. The book dives into quality chapters on the quantified parameters of fitness: strength, endurance, and mobility. Here&#8217;s a teaser, and stay tuned for more as we near the August release date:

**Edit: I just want to point out that even if you aren&#8217;t a &#8220;fitness trainee&#8221;, this book is chock full of quality information, even if you&#8217;re merely a strength trainee who wants to add in conditioning. The strength and endurance chapters alone are worth the money and could be books by themselves. Then we take the concepts of strength, endurance, and mobility and tie them all together and teach how they should be structured and programmed. Feel free to ask questions and stay tuned for excerpts and features.** 

This is a video of Glenn Pendlay cleaning 170 quite a few years ago. I think it&#8217;d be cool to see more of these converted home videos. I think this might be the old WFAC location?

This is a sweet video of Dmitry Klokov clean and jerking 242 in training. With a head band. And spandex. And a tank-top. And beast mode. As he walked away I&#8217;m pretty sure he said, &#8220;Bitches ain&#8217;t shit.&#8221;

May as well show you this other Klokov vid to keep this &#8220;sweet music&#8221; theme alive. He almost snatches 214kg off of blocks. Almost.
