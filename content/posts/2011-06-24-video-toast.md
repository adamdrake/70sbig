I haven&#8217;t been doing mobility work as much as a should, and travelling and writing all day aren&#8217;t helping. The few things that prevent me from doing it are a) efficient use of the time b) setting a clock to help me gauge the length of each stretch, and c) the prospect of getting into a pain-in-the-ass position.

This video introduces an interval timer that will automatically chime and repeat itself so you can string various stretches together. I give an example of the MINIMUM stretches a lifter should be doing. If you guys aren&#8217;t doing these stretches, then use this method. At the very least, the &#8220;3 Stretches For Lifters&#8221; can be done in less than seven minutes of time. Of course, it would be better to hold each stretch for longer than one minute, but one minute is better than no minute.
  
_Edit: How the hell did this video get 2 views before I even looked at it?_

Secondly, this thread happened last night. It&#8217;s a solid thread, but the implications are interesting. I expect to hear about this for a while from Brent. Oh, and Tom and Jacob regularly post on the site. As you can see, I kept their true identity safe from prying eyes. Click image for a larger version.
