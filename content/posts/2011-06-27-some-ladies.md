Monday is the day where we talk about 70&#8217;s Big Females. Here are some videos worth checking out.
  

  
Here&#8217;s a video of Cori snatching 75kg.

This next one is a simple clean with an easy power jerk at 85kg? This meet was from last November (Mid American Championships in Buffalo Grove, IL), but she broke her wrist shortly after the meet. Cori just started to snatch and jerk last week, and she maxed with a 72kg snatch and 85kg on the clean and jerk. There are plenty of guys who don&#8217;t lift more than that. Good luck with the continued rehab, Cori.

You may remember Lily from [this video][1], but here&#8217;s an older video of her pulling 225 for a triple. She&#8217;s probably weighing 140 here?

Lastly, you have probably seen [this video][2] of Olympian Cara Heads (squatting 146kg/321.2 pounds for a set of ten). Here&#8217;s a video that shows that she&#8217;s in great shape despite lifting constituting the majority of her training careers. She&#8217;s pretty awesome.
