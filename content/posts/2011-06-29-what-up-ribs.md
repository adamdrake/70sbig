**Simple Rib Recipe**
  
I didn&#8217;t grow up in Texas and I didn&#8217;t grow up eating expertly smoked meats. I&#8217;m not a cooking expert and I&#8217;m not Gant. However, this is the easiest and cheapest rib recipe ever.
  

  
**What You Need**
  
1. Pork spare ribs (or whatever you want, but these will probably be cheaper)
  
2. Some kind of barbecue dry rub
  
3. Barbecue sauce (optional, but awesome)
  
4. Casserole dish.
  
These ingredients won&#8217;t cost more than $15 to $20 the first time you make the ribs. After that, you&#8217;ll only need the ribs themselves. Ribs are at cost on a military base (mine were $1.76 a pound &#8212; almost 5 pounds for less than $9).
  

  
**What To Do**
  
1. Rub the ribs down with the dry rub
  
2. Put the covered casserole dish in an oven heated to 275 degrees Fahrenheit. They&#8217;ll cook for 2 hours
  
3. Remove, set oven to broil, and baste ribs with barbecue sauce
  
5. Broil for about five minutes to caramelize the sauce
  

  
I made a video of this simple recipe. Only the first three minutes have to do with the preparation of the ribs. Everything after that is commentary. Useful, but not necessary if you don&#8217;t want to watch a vid of me for 8 minutes.
