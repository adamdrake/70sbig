  I don&#8217;t really have any recent lifting videos that would be worth watching, but here&#8217;s a video of me doing rows with a 150 pound dumbbell for 20 reps.<br /> <br /> <iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WEwH2SPxv6k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Usually there won&#8217;t be as many fucking videos of myself, but I&#8217;m finishing up a project today and haven&#8217;t had time for any other material. If you have a problem with that, then [watch this][1].

Additionally Brent and I will be in Monterey for a lifting workshop on July 9. Brent will just be there, giving you indiscriminate looks and I&#8217;ll coaching lifting technique. Then we&#8217;ll go to eat and hear Brent give us a fucking preface on his diet and training, implying that we need to take care of him like Gizmo from Gremlins.

Let&#8217;s get a good convo going in the comments. First I want to point out that I write and do a lot of weird stuff in posts or videos that no one ever comments on. I mainly do it just to see if anybody will say anything, but you guys apparently just accept it as normal. When my mom filmed the &#8220;[helpful mobility vid][3]&#8220;, she goes, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to comb your hair and put on some shorts?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t hesitate to say, &#8220;Absolutely not. If anything it&#8217;s better this way.&#8221;
