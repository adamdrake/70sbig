I suppose all of you turncoat Americans think today is some kind of special, right? Well, you&#8217;re wrong. July 2nd, 1776 was the day that Congress actually voted for independence. John Adams even wrote a sweet letter that said, &#8220;Americans are gonna look back 200 years or so and think that this day was da bomb. They&#8217;ll shoot things in the air, drink a lot of ale, and eat ribs while shirtless because it&#8217;s so friggin&#8217; American.&#8221; I think he showed his wife and gave her rump a nice friendly pat.
  

  
July 4th was the day that the Declaration of Independence was written, but it wasn&#8217;t actually signed until August 2nd. This is basically the same thing as making a big deal about the day Stephen King starts writing his new hit novel (about demons, spaghetti stains, and revolvers &#8212; I shit you not, this is in The Regulators) instead of the actual day it comes out. Speaking of which, [A Dance With Dragons][1] comes out on July 12th. The day Martin started writing it is irrelevant, but July 12th will make me wet at the tip.
  

  
Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy your day off. Or something. May Zeus, Odin, Apollo, the Warrior, and the old gods bless America.
