  I&#8217;m not super into metal, but these are some things that you ought to see.<br />

**Austrian Death Machine**
  
The other day I asked Antigen, &#8220;Who is from Austria and is a death machine? You have two choices.&#8221;

The singer of &#8220;As I Lay Dying&#8221; made this band and album as a tribute to you-know-who. It&#8217;s, at the very least, amusing. Songs like &#8220;[Get Back To The Choppa][2]&#8221; and &#8220;[I Need Your Clothes, Your Boots and Your Motorcycle][3]&#8221; revive some great memories, but &#8220;I Am A Cybernetic Organism, Living Tissue Over (Metal) Endoskeleton&#8221; is awesome:

However, if you watched some of those videos and noticed that the singer (vocalist, whatever) looks to much like a poon&#8230;then this next band is more your style.

**Amon Amarth**
  
My buddy Al introduced me to both of these bands, but Amon Amarth left a lasting impression. This band is full of giant Swedish vikings with crazy-long hair and out-of-control beards. They look like they just sacked a village, raped all the women, cooked half the livestock, and torched the rest. It&#8217;s called Viking Metal. Deal with it.

I think a lot of you guys will be able to use these bands in your training if you aren&#8217;t already. You&#8217;re welcome.
