This is a video I shot on a day when I shot videos wearing the same tank top (just for SMC). In this video, I explain what&#8217;s going on anatomically during pressing movements and elaborating on why it&#8217;s important to ensure a proper external rotation. I finish off (ear muffs) with an easy cue to use for women doing push-ups. Women may initially have a difficult time with push-up form because when they do them, they flare their elbows out (internal rotation) and don&#8217;t really utilize or work the pectoral musculature.

Brent and I trained yesterday. We benched, high bar squatted, and then did weighted pull-ups. Then we were uncomfortably catabolic. Then we did poorly in StarCraft. Benching was okay, the bar had a lot of motion and whip, so it left something to be desired for. I squatted the most I have since my hip injury, and it was high bar; it actually feels more stable. I will be regularly high and low bar squatting each week. Then I got real pissed off at this shitty dip belt that Jacob has and pretty much raged quit. Brent on the other hand seemed to be aiming to not do his planned five reps. Like, at all.

Someone on the [70&#8217;s Big Facebook Fan Page][1] linked this vid. It&#8217;s so sweet.

Today Brent and I are going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I aim to have him touch a manta ray in one of the tanks which will be doubly amusing because he&#8217;s terrified of them. I&#8217;ll get it on video.
