Nate took me to the air bus shuttle from Monterey to SFO around 5 yesterday. Flight was at 10:30 PM. Got delayed a little. Got in to Atlanta at 6:30. Got home at 8:30 AM. Slept till 4:30 PM. I&#8217;d rather leave that. Also, the weather is 30 degrees warmer here and it&#8217;s overcast. I got sweaty using the john. I could leave this.
  

  
Here&#8217;s a quick video upload.

Here&#8217;s a pic of me trying to throw Brent off of a pier at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
