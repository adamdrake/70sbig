I&#8217;m gonna be hiking early in the morning, so here&#8217;s a video of Briskin&#8217;s PR Friday from a week ago. Before you ask, he has a little bit of chest dropping that causes a forward lean in his bottom position. We&#8217;ve already talked about it and we don&#8217;t need your help.

Here&#8217;s another a vid of us hitting some DB curls post workout. Brent&#8217;s not in the vid cause he already changed. Jake really wanted this video to happen, and I know he&#8217;d be heartbroken if it didn&#8217;t make an appearance. There&#8217;s still some more random vids, and they&#8217;ll be released periodically over the next few days (if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re into).
