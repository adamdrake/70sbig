I met [Ben Claridad][1] last year at the USAW Senior Nationals when we weighed in, and we became buds. Later that summer, he let AC and I stay at his house when we did a workshop in Sacramento. Since then I helped convince him to start a blog for his artwork and training, and we still are yet to edit a story that he wrote (fucking call me, bro). Ben competed in this year&#8217;s Senior Nationals in the 105+ category so that he could get some extra points for his team, [Hassle Free Barbell Club][2] (shout out to Paul Doherty again &#8212; he helped me last year at nationals and is a really great guy). Anyway, last year Ben hit 132/160 at nationals and self-described them as looking &#8220;like garbage&#8221;. This year he hit 143/167 and totaled 310kg after rehabbing from a back injury.

Nice job, Ben. He put on some extra weigh for this competition and will be dieting back down. I assume he&#8217;ll be growing his hair too? Ben&#8217;s a really good guy and trains really hard.
  

  
Now for another video from the continuing saga of Justin and Brent hanging out. A lot of you probably avoid mobility work because it&#8217;s hard and uncomfortable. Yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of both of those. Here&#8217;s the proof.

I also made a [video for Saul][3], because his life is on its last thread.
