I&#8217;m disappointed that Family Guy made it to Australia since it&#8217;s a real shitty show (_Edit: Tom was watching it as I was typing this_). Tom and I went into Sydney today. I continued asking various Asians what their APM and race preference was. That&#8217;s pretty much all I&#8217;ve got.
