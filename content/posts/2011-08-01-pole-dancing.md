I met some pole dancers in Australia and they were both muscular and toned despite not lifting (I know Johnston is proud). I&#8217;ve [mentioned before][1] that most women can garner a healthy physique by eating a non-vegetarian diet with plenty of meat (insinuating the animal kind here, boys). Such is the case with the pole dancers I met; by doing plenty of pulling movements their backs and bodies were developed and toned. Not only is this true, it&#8217;s just an excuse for you guys to watch pole dancing. You&#8217;re welcome.
  

  
I didn&#8217;t want to spend time looking for a vid, so here&#8217;s footage of the 2011 Australian Pole Dancing Championship. Uh, if you work in a church, you probably don&#8217;t want to open this right now.

Regardless of your opinion on pole dancers or strippers, the pole work is impressive. It&#8217;s a non-boring version of gymnastics.
  

  
Here are some other videos from Australia. This one is footage from the nature park.

This one is me making fun of Tom because he can&#8217;t scramble eggs.

In this one from [Shire Speed and Strength][2], Tom squats 150kg for a triple, I snatch 120 and 130 (I missed 130 at first, I thought it was 125 because I&#8217;m an idiot), and there&#8217;s some vid of Blake (who is playing football at Hawaii now) jerking 160).
