Several years ago I made it a point to always encourage women to train with weights and high intensity exercise as opposed to the LSD methods associated with conventional fitness. It has, and always will be, an interest of mine because it benefits everyone; it benefits the chick because she&#8217;s [not beat down][1] by stupid conventional skinny-body dysmorphia, she&#8217;s healthier, she&#8217;s [stronger][2] and capable, and it benefits me (or her husband, boyfriend, etc.) cause she looks better. After coaching 50,000 squats, you can&#8217;t help but say, &#8220;Yeah, she&#8217;d be better if she squatted.&#8221;
  

  
I saw a quote the other day that said, &#8220;Women, we don&#8217;t care about your shoes, just your body. Go to the gym and not the store.&#8221; In the time that I&#8217;ve been training and coaching people &#8212; as well as the lifespan of this website &#8212; I&#8217;ve tried to show why and how training can benefit women. However, despite the daily readership of 70&#8217;s Big, you can only shout the same message so many times before it gets jaded and fails to reach new ears.

    Is it enough to post pictures of Erin Stern?

One of the female readers once asked, &#8220;What we can do to spread this message?&#8221; Personally, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to happen from this site; the message only reaches so far, and it&#8217;s typically getting to the women who already train (or at least who lift weights and condition regularly). I think that the realm of conventional fitness has to be broken into before this concept will become more popular. I hope that [FIT][3] ([Fan Page][4] and [Twitter][5]) can help open the door in what will be a long struggle of improving how people train. But will it be enough? Will it help mold America&#8217;s (the world&#8217;s?) perception of what an attractive woman will be?
  

  
I don&#8217;t know, because I&#8217;m very much [not a woman][6], and my opinion may only be partially relevant. I had intended on interviewing some of the chicks I know through this site and getting their point of view for this post, but instead **I welcome girls/chicks/women to post in the comments and give your thoughts on how you think training can be introduced and spread to a greater female population (whether through this site, on the internet, or in general)**. We&#8217;ll see if we can draw any conclusions because I&#8217;m sincerely interested in the discussion.
