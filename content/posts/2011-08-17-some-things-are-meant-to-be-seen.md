There&#8217;s been plenty of discussion lately. Now let&#8217;s just view things. I promise you won&#8217;t be disappointed in this post.
  

  
**Frank Frazetta** was an American fantasy and science fiction artist who painted [awesome pieces][1]. Frazetta&#8217;s interpretation of [Conan][2] launched his career and subsequently changed how artists portrayed fantasy/sci-fi forever. [Here][3] is a good piece I found on Frazetta&#8217;s ability. Both Rippetoe and Kilgore are big fans of Frazetta, and I first saw my favorite piece of Frazetta&#8217;s hanging up in Rip&#8217;s house:

**Sharpwriter** is an American deviant artist that I just found recently (thanks to Justin&#8217;s\*** link). When you look at his pictures, make sure and click them to increase the size because has incredible detail. He seems to enjoy combining different concepts into one image (like a [cyborg viking][4]) as well as doing his rendition of popular characters (like [The Joker][5], [Bepop][6], and [Rocksteady][7]). I more so want to point out these patriotic pieces:

There are some other presidential images [here][8], including this one of [FDR][9] that made me laugh. You can view more of Sharpwriter&#8217;s images at his [gallery][10]; there are some really good ones, including this one titled &#8220;[Welcome to Valhalla][11]&#8220;.
  

  
Lastly, if you&#8217;ve ever been irritated with me, then should enjoy this video of Tom and I getting mauled by trained attack dogs.

Which picture is your favorite? I think Frazetta&#8217;s images are much more 70&#8217;s Big than Sharpwriter&#8217;s (I think Dr. Kilgore told me Frazetta studied anatomy so that he&#8217;d improve on his ability to paint musculature), but Sharpwriter&#8217;s detail is amazing. What other fantasy/sci-fi artists compare to these guys?
