Thursday I went to Judo class with Gant and got to see my buddy [Devin][1] again. I started training Devin to get stronger when he was 12 years old, 6 feet tall, and weighed 200 pounds. Now he&#8217;s 14, is 6&#8217;4&#8243;, and weighs 220 pounds. I worked with him during last night&#8217;s class and we threw each other around for a couple of hours. It&#8217;s very humbling to have a 14-year-old man-handle you. Here&#8217;s a video we recorded a little over a year ago. Devin is 12 here (updated videos will come soon).

Of course I regret not getting involved with Judo more when I lived in Wichita Falls. I&#8217;ve always been very interested in using the physical attributes built in the gym into athletic endeavors. Personally, I haven&#8217;t been involved in a sport that requires athleticism, reaction, and finesse in quite a while. Learning new things is a humbling experience, and it&#8217;s something I encourage you all to do.
  

  
Lifting may be a new activity to you, yet I hope it&#8217;s your gateway to other things as well. I grew up loving weight training, but it was [a means to an end][2] regarding football preparation. I&#8217;ve been involved with competing in weightlifting (including Senior Nationals) and coaching powerlifting (including USAPL Raw Nationals twice), but sports and activities that require more are very interesting. In lifting, the same motions are repeated over and over, and there isn&#8217;t an exceptional amount of athletic ability inherent in it. This, of course, isn&#8217;t a knock on lifting. I love lifting and will always include it in my training, but using the strength and power developed through lifting into another sport is just as rewarding (if not more) as competing in the barbell sports alone.
  

  
Some of you are merely strength training enthusiasts. Others of you aim to remain more capable than the average person and want to preserve your health. Some of you may have picked and fully committed to powerlifting and weightlifting. Objectively, only a small percentage of you will be competitive at a high level that would require long-term specialization. In the same way that I encourage you to enter your first lifting meet, I encourage you to try a new sport or activity and even compete in it.
  

  
I can&#8217;t imagine anything more vulnerable than agreeing to do a Judo tournament in two months from now. I&#8217;ve had one session of getting my ass kicked by a young international competitor, and the thought of doing it live against an opponent who has their shit together is intimidating. But that&#8217;s the point. Competition isn&#8217;t supposed to make you feel nice; for the majority of us it&#8217;s going to be a character building experience.
  

  
Trying a martial art like Judo can be rewarding in many ways. You will improve your coordination, agility, and body awareness while improving your ability to throw someone through a table when necessary (it often is). Gant once rhetorically asked me, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point of being strong if you can&#8217;t throw someone across the room?&#8221; If you can find a place where you can also get some quality striking/sparring and actual real world self defense, then you&#8217;re automatically more useful. Being strong doesn&#8217;t make you more useful &#8212; conditioning your body to utilize that strength is what makes you useful.
  

  
**Happy PR Friday** &#8212; Post your training updates and PRs to the comments. Ask questions about or discuss some other sports to get involved with. If you have questions on Judo (including where to go and how to get started), put them in the comments and I can get some resources to you from Gant.
