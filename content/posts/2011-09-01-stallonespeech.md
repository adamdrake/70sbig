Drove 12 hours yesterday. Then slept 13. Getting Fantasy Football stuff together today and will update in a bit.
  

  
In the mean time check out this awesome video that Justin A. linked on the Fan Page. If you don&#8217;t want to watch the whole thing, at least listen to Stallone&#8217;s speech at 2:18.

> Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain&#8217;t all sunshine and rainbows. It&#8217;s a very mean and nasty place and I don&#8217;t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain&#8217;t about how hard ya hit. It&#8217;s about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That&#8217;s how winning is done! Now if you know what you&#8217;re worth then go out and get what you&#8217;re worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain&#8217;t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain&#8217;t you! You&#8217;re better than that!

Oh, and thank the seven&#8230;**FOOTBALL IS HERE**
