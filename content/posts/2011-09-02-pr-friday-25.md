Hectic week, yet we can rejoice in PR Friday. Post your weekly training updates to the comments. Discuss football: Boise State vs UGA and LSU vs Oregon.
  

  
This video took forever to upload. This is Mike making his shakes for his next day of work. He&#8217;s real meticulous about eating and making it consistent every day. He also gets a lot of calories and protein from shakes since they are convenient and cost less. He still eats about two pounds of meat a day. I&#8217;m not saying that what Mike does is necessary, but it&#8217;ll show you how he plans his food intake and keeps it consistent over time.
