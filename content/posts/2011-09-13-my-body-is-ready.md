In a perfect world you could completely commit to training and devote every aspect of your life to improve you&#8217;re training. Alas! You aren&#8217;t special and don&#8217;t get paid to perform and compete (I know this realization is hard to understand). Instead, you might have a job, have to study for exams, or have to help wipe your child&#8217;s bum. Whatever the case, it may cut into your training and learning how to work around that is important.
  

  
**Stress The Whole Body**
  
I haven&#8217;t had regular access to a gym or a repeating schedule for quite a while (probably six months), yet I&#8217;ve gotten a bit bigger, a lot stronger, and rehabbed back from a gnarly hip injury. The key with shoddy scheduling is to train the entire body when finally getting access to a gym.
  

  
This doesn&#8217;t mean you hit every lift you can think of, but emulate what most linear progressions consist of: a squat, a press, and a pull. Some days I have just sn/cj while other days I&#8217;ve sn, cj, squat, pressed, curls, and did RDLs. One day I squatted, rowed, and did RDLs (with no press movement). I&#8217;ve benched, squatted, did RDLs, and weighted pull-ups. Each week I try to bench and press once each, squat and RDLs at least once, and dabble in various assistance (at least once each of rowing, curling, weighted pull-ups, and round back extension). The point is that each day has lifts that use a lot of muscle mass and work on the structures that make the body strong: hips, back, legs, and shoulders. If your schedule is shoddy, aim to perform some of the basic lifts a minimum amount of times throughout the week. This will save you from having to figure it out each time you step in the gym.

**Don&#8217;t Wreck Yourself**
  
When you do finally get to train, don&#8217;t be a wise guy. You wouldn&#8217;t want your lifting exposure to give you crippling soreness. Ease into heavier weight over time, be patient, and don&#8217;t aim to PR every day. Save the most stressful lifts, like deadlift, for the end of your training week (if you know when you&#8217;ll get to the gym again). Don&#8217;t hesitate to work in RDLs or round back extensions in its stead; these exercises can help augment the deadlift when you finally get the time to focus on it again.
  


**Know When To Back Off**
  
Just because you finally get to train doesn&#8217;t mean your body is ready. When I was in Australia, I only trained twice: the first day felt really shitty (I squatted, pressed, and did pull-ups), then the second day I matched a PR on snatch and came close on clean and jerk. However, if my body wasn&#8217;t ready on day two, then I would have just done some sets across instead of pushing the weight.
  

  
Recently I tried to snatch when I wasn&#8217;t feeling that great. Maybe it&#8217;s because I squatted and did RDLs two days before, but I just wasn&#8217;t feeling it that day. I ended up missing simple snatches to the point where I audibly said &#8220;Fuck this,&#8221; and left to go bench. Then my first set at a regularly easy weight on bench was difficult; I racked it after the first rep and was all pissed off. I declared that I was done training for the day and just did some DB rows and dips. My body was not ready.
  

  
Ease back the training session if you aren&#8217;t feeling great. You can do this by changing the exercises (remember the &#8220;<a href="/blog/2011/08/when-in-doubt/" target="_blank">When in doubt, train your back</a>&#8221; post?) or reducing the volume and load of your intended workout.
  

  
**Maintain Mobility**
  
Some times the limiting factor is the body being all wound up from sitting at a desk, in a car, or on an airplane. If you have a good habit of working on your mobility on a daily basis, then these events won&#8217;t smash you as hard. Take care to do extra mobility work when you have been in any crappy position for a long time. &#8220;Crappy position&#8221; would imply that your knees and hips are bent and you are slouching forward. You can&#8217;t train well if you aren&#8217;t pliable enough to go through a ROM properly.
