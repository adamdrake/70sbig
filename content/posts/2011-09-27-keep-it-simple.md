I just got home from the 70&#8217;s Big Workshop Weekend in Chicago. We had a really good group and it was a fun weekend. I want to thank Greg from <a href="http://www.bulldogbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bulldog CrossFit</a> for hosting the lifting portion on Saturday and Ellee from <a href="http://acu4athletes.com/" target="_blank">Acupuncture for Athletes</a> for hosting the programming portion on Sunday.

As we talked about programming on Sunday evening, I thought of a concept that would be relevant to readers of this site. I could talk for hours about programming (as the attendees observed on Sunday). I could write thousands of words on it (and have in the <a href="/ebook/" target="_blank">TM E-book</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Dr-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1317079743&#038;sr=1-1" target="_blank">FIT</a>). I will continue to not only write about aspects of programming, but the other forms of content on this site: mechanics, nutrition, curls, supplementation, recovery, mobility, curls, sports, curls, lifters of yore, and, of course, curls. I put a lot of thought into programming and helping you in various ways to help you program, but when you sit down to actually do it &#8212; for yourself or others &#8212; keep it simple.
  

  
I showed a few programs to the attendees that will be in upcoming e-books as well as templates that I have and currently use on myself. I gave them reasoning for the placement of every item and rep scheme. However, I don&#8217;t want them to have sensory overload or over-think the process when actually doing it. Simply focus on what your goal is, pick a rep scheme that would work towards that goal, and utilize the basic barbell lifts into a weekly template. Sprinkle in a few assistance exercises or conditioning activities and you&#8217;re set. Don&#8217;t feel the need to over complicate the process just because I give many details and reasoning.
  

  
**Trapeze**
  
Last Friday I did trapeze by the lake in Chicago. I regret to inform you that it is not in my speedo. Yet we hung upside down from the bar, did back flips, and got caught when upside down by another trapeze dude &#8212; you know, the thing that happens in Batman and Robin, except I didn&#8217;t die (couldn&#8217;t find that scene on YouTube). I also had tremendous pain in the proximal gastrocnemius from hanging upside down from my knees. It wasn&#8217;t Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness; it was Immediate Fucking Soreness.
