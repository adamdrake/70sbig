How much mobility have you done today? In the last few days? Last week? Mobility is but one of the helpful and necessary aspects of recovering and training well. After seeing the mobility capabilities of my new friends in Chicago, I realized that they suck. Badly.
  

  
I hope that regularly bringing up the topic will a) remind you to do mobility, b) influence you to do if if you don&#8217;t, c) simplify the complicated realm of mobility, and d) show you some alternate techniques to improve your &#8216;mobility&#8217;. It&#8217;s important to include this kind of stuff regularly because they can help prevent some common injuries or tweaks that are associated with bad posture, lifting technique, or general tightness over time. Everyone has individual body dimensions, muscular structure, and tightness, so each stretch may not effect the same tissues on you as your friend.
