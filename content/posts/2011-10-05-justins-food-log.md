Some readers are really interested in what my diet looks like. I&#8217;m the first to point out that it&#8217;s not perfect (or interesting), but whether or not there is a perfect diet is debatable anyway. I&#8217;m 6&#8242; and usually weigh between 210 and 212 pounds. If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say my body fat is about 10%, however lower ab veins are said to be visible under 7 or 8%, so I guess I could be as low as 8 or 9%? In any case, my diet and training has evolved to the point that I&#8217;m stronger in most lifts than ever (with the exception of squat due to injury and overall body weight loss) while being the most lean and athletic I&#8217;ve ever been. Monday I pressed 220&#215;3 on my third triple, and last week I push-pressed 260&#215;2 on my fifth double after clean and jerking up to 315 for three singles.
  

  
I don&#8217;t really like talking about my training because I don&#8217;t like the lack of privacy inherent in a voyeur look at something that takes up a lot of my time (training, eating, recovering, etc.), especially when other aspects of my life will dictate and alter these activities. I&#8217;m not so narcissistic (like the late Zyzz) to think anyone really gives a shit anyway. The point is that I&#8217;m not that great, but I&#8217;m above average in most things to the point where my diet might be relevant. It&#8217;s not something that everyone needs to try and emulate, since I think diet is a very individualistic kind of thing, but hopefully you can get some pointers or ideas by looking at it.

My average day involves:
  
&#8211; Water, vitamins, and fish oil
  
&#8211; Fruit and whey protein smoothie
  
&#8211; 6 Eggs and bacon (random carb)
  
&#8211; Random meal (pre-workout is typically whey and random simple carb)
  
&#8211; At least one pound of meat, typically beef with salad and/or sweet potato
  
&#8211; Whey and sunflower seeds or peanut/almond butter
  
&#8211; Fishoil again
  

  
There are more specifics, but you can watch the video to hear them. The first three parts are always the same every day with slight variations (e.g. today I had 7 eggs), and the latter meals are variable. I&#8217;ll change things depending on if I have a high carb or sodium meal or if I drink a lot of alcohol (which is uncommon). This is sort of the baseline thing I do, and when there are significant perturbations, then I react in specific ways. I don&#8217;t shy away from awesome things like bacon cheeseburgers, waffles, or chocolate, but sometimes prepare my day around them or have set reactions to return to normal after eating them. In any case, enjoy the video. Oh, and the it&#8217;s kinda long, but it isn&#8217;t necessarily boring. Especially the beginning because I had just woken up.
