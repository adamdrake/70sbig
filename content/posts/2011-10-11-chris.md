Chris is a big, bad dude. One time, Mike, Chris, and I were leaving a bar and Chris was worried about the group of people his girlfriend was hanging out with. I don&#8217;t remember why he was mad, but I was convinced that I would have to go with him as he kicked these people&#8217;s door in and pick them up by the neck and bash their heads together like King Kong.

    Chris and his rig
  </p>
</div>

Chris has a pretty full schedule. He&#8217;s in his second year of grad school (getting his Master&#8217;s), teaches classes for his grad assistantship, and also has a part-time job. It doesn&#8217;t leave a lot of time and energy for training, but he gets it done nonetheless.

Another time Chris and I went to a sports store and for at least half an hour we were making up full names that included Gordon, Todd, and Melvin. Chris suggested Todd McGordon-fuck. Gordon Todd McDugan-Fuck was one of mine. Gordon McTodd. Melvin O&#8217;Gordon. This went on for at least half an hour and we laughed the whole time.

Despite his size and strength, Chris has excellent precision in various athletic movements with throwing and catching coming to mind. He has excellent hands and can gracefully throw any type of ball. We used to go to the pool and throw the tennis ball. He&#8217;d call me up, &#8220;Tennis ball?&#8221; and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Yeah. Be right over.&#8221; Of course it would take me at least 45 minutes when I only lived across the highway, but it&#8217;s fiiine.

Another time we were eating breakfast at a diner in San Antonio, and Brent was being extra ornery. He was antagonizing Chris, so Chris said, &#8220;Ask me how much I squat Brent?&#8221;
  
&#8220;How much do you squat, Chris?&#8221;
  
&#8220;First, more than you&#8230;&#8221;
  
And that&#8217;s how it goes.
