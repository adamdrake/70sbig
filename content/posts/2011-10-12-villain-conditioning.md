Running, burpees, turkish get ups, kettlebell swings, and&#8230;pain. That&#8217;s what <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/" target="_blank">Johnny Pain&#8217;s</a> new e-book, &#8220;<a href="http://strengthvillain.com/?page_id=20" target="_blank">50 More Greyskull Approved Conditioning Workouts for the Modern Viking</a>&#8220;, consists of. The model for all of the workouts is the infamous <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/?p=802#more-802" target="_blank">Bony</a>, who apparently is a glutton for punishment.

This e-book is pretty straight forward: it consists of 50 conditioning workouts that will make a man out of you. When I program conditioning for someone who is training for something, I primarily the entire workout to consist of efficient, large-scale movements that utilize a lot of muscle to use up as much energy as possible to induce the stress. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Dr-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1318436531&#038;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><strong>FIT</strong></a> I also talk about how to properly program the conditioning in accordance with your strength training. If you combine these elements with this e-book by JP, you have a repertoire of workouts to plug into your program.
  

  
There are a few workouts that use some slower movements, like floor whipers, lunges, and leg raises (interspersed with chin-ups), yet there is something to be said for getting through grueling sets of exercises. It does a few things: it provides a mental challenge without superfluous chipper-type workouts, it gets lots of muscular contraction which can assist in developing the look of muscles (see Arnold&#8217;s Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding if you&#8217;re confused), and they still provide a much higher relative stress compared to just straight lifting. In other words, the slower, arduous movements may not get maximum levels of stress, but for most people they won&#8217;t _need_ those high levels of stress and can receive a benefit to conditioning and musculature with these other movements. Besides, a movement like the backwards crab walk &#8212; influenced by JP&#8217;s Airborne infantry background &#8212; is a good way to work on agility, mobility, and pissing blood.
  

  
Workout #14 is very similar to something that I have used once a week for a while: burpees alternated with kettlebell swings (this workout alternates them in 30 second increments). JP uses creative exercise and rest period combinations that I&#8217;m sure will give you plenty of ideas for your own training. The best part of it all is that the workouts are all short and intense; you get a lot of bang for your buck so that you can bang when you fuck. God damn, I should copyright that.
