You know what? You guys don&#8217;t know shit. You don&#8217;t know what a hard day&#8217;s work is. You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to bleed and sweat. You don&#8217;t know how to dig DEEP, real DEEP, and get that last big of your SOUL and have it consume your nether region. You don&#8217;t know how to get a TASTE of the HARD work that is associated with being a champion. You don&#8217;t understand that to BE THE MAN, you have to BEAT THE MAN. This video teaches you a thing or two about training with a champion&#8217;s intensity. Take notes, you pile of shit.
