This week I want to motivate you women who actually do train, whether you&#8217;re already strong or not. You may be the queen in your gym, but somewhere out there a stronger woman is training her heart out. It just so happens that there is a gym full of these gals at <a href="http://www.crossfitretribution.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Retribution</a> in Westminster, MD. This facility is run by Beau Bryant (not to be confused with <a href="http://www3.images.coolspotters.com/photos/83115/bear-bryant-profile.jpg" target="_blank">this guy</a>) and he has developed a stable of good lifters and is even using The Texas Method (he bought <a href="/ebook/" target="_blank">the e-book</a> a while back).
  

  
This is Beau&#8217;s wife Angie hitting a fucking solid set of 225&#215;3 on squat. I&#8217;m impressed, because this is a beautiful low bar back squat and she crushes the first rep. The neat part about it is that Beau sent me a video of her after last week&#8217;s Intensity Day and she missed the third rep at 220.

I just watched it again &#8212; god damn it what a great set. She doesn&#8217;t have any chest dropping due to thoracic weakness or hamstring weakness. Just real fucking solid. Well done Beau and Angie, well done. Oh, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj_5IqZWxR0" target="_blank">here</a> is their new shirt.
  

  
I could end the post and be very happy, but THERE&#8217;S MOAR.
  

  
Here is Tiff &#8212; she had no barbell training experience prior to joining the gym. Here she is pulling 290&#215;5 like she&#8217;s drying her hair.

Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idVItht6afQ&#038;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a vid</a> of her squatting 275&#215;3.
  

  
Lastly, we have the 110 pound mother of two, Leah squatting 160&#215;1 a couple months ago. The record in her weight class is 170, so they are trying to break that.

Well done ladies, and nice job to Beau for good coaching and programming. If you want to submit your female lifting videos, shoot them <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
