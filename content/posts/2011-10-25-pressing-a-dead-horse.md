People scour the internet searching for the majestic Press Booster that miraculously improves pressing ability. Unfortunately the Press Booster is merely a tall tale created by real life creatures known as &#8220;fuckers&#8221; in order to buffalo you. What fuckers don&#8217;t realize is that first comes mechanics, then comes consistency, and then comes belligerency in a baby carriage.
  

  
**Mechanics**
  
Too often I see pressing grips that are very wide &#8212; the forearms should be vertical in the starting or rack position, and they should also be vertical from the front and side view. The wrist should be in a close-compacted position that puts the bar in the heel of the palm. The bar should remain close to the face during the ascent and descent while the lifter gets their torso under the bar. Speaking of the torso, it shouldn&#8217;t bend much and the thoracic/lumbar junction should never be in hyper extension. The hips should also not be in anterior rotation at lockout. Lastly, assuming all of this other stuff is occurring correctly, the shoulders shouldn&#8217;t be internally rotating. Pretty simple, huh?
  

  
I&#8217;ll be very clear in admitting that this post cannot address the questions that the last paragraph presents because I could write a long post on each item. The point is that there is a lot going on and until the mechanics are addressed, the program itself is not to blame.
  

  
**Consistency**
  
Pressing will increase with diligency (not a word). Constantly chipping away at it over time will develop a good press. I have been pressing for at least once a week since July of 2010 and have averaged at least once a week since January of 2009 (the only reason I didn&#8217;t initially use Jan of 2009 is because when I was on the Texas Method I alternated bench/press weeks). The press benefits from an accumulated work load. Most linear progressions nowadays utilize a good amount of pressing, yet eventually there is a limit on how far three sets of five (3&#215;5) can be progressed. There&#8217;s no point in beating a dead horse, so using some different rep ranges will help increase pressing strength. The first thing to play around with in programming is to use some heavier weight, but not to abandon old rep schemes. One example is that I have developed an ascending 3&#215;3 and 3&#215;5 rep scheme that alternates every week on the press and bench with <a href="http://www.crossfitironhorse.com/2011/07/great_success.png" target="_blank">great success</a>. The key is not to use anything fancy but to keep utilizing the press.
  

  
**Belligerency**
  
Once some basic programmatic variables have been played with, you&#8217;ll have to take chances on your pressing days. You&#8217;ll have to try and push your last triple, last set of five, or your 3&#215;5 sets across. You&#8217;ll have to learn how to grind through tough presses, and you do this by getting experience with hard reps. You will not press heavy weights if you push the bar forward so learn how to keep it close and get under it. Once you can grind though a ten second press, you will know how to fight through the hard reps.
  

  
Using other exercises to build the press isn&#8217;t necessary until mechanics, consistency, and belligerency are addressed. Then there are a few options for the seasoned presser. But whatever, this was all just an excuse to post my recent PR (this one is not in a speedo like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqsiykYN720" target="_blank">last time</a>).

You can see that I have a bit of stretch reflex to aid the start of the rep. In training, I don&#8217;t mind this assuming the fundamental mechanics are in place (referenced above). You&#8217;ll see that my torso, hips, and knees maintain rigidity, which are my requirements for a proper press. However, I would not allow this stretch reflex in competition as it is difficult to quantify and subsequently difficult to judge. I don&#8217;t have a problem in doing it, and I prefer to do it for the sake of handling more weight and reps (as long as it&#8217;s not excessive, and it&#8217;s not in either video).
