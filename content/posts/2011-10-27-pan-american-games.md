The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Pan_American_Games" target="_blank">2011 Pan American Games</a> are in full swing and 70&#8217;s Big has been covering some of the weightlifting sessions on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a>. There&#8217;s usually some decent stuff going on at the fan page, but this is an instance where we were essentially posting results of the sessions as they were happening. If you can&#8217;t see Facebook, then you can always follow on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> too.
  

  
I didn&#8217;t know the exact times of the lifting because the Pan Am website makes it difficult to navigate to the next day&#8217;s scheduling. In any case, today is the last day of lifting, and the schedule is as follows:
  

  
&#8211; 1:00 PM &#8211; Men&#8217;s 105kg (featuring American Donnie Shankle)
  
&#8211; 3:00 PM &#8211; Women&#8217;s 75+ (featuring Americans Sarah Robles and Chioma Amaechi)
  
&#8211; 5:00 PM &#8211; Men&#8217;s 105+ (featuring American Pat Mendes)

Guadalajara is in the Central time zone, yet I think the&#8217;s times are in Eastern time. Be on the lookout for the sessions (if anyone can confirm the time zone, then let me know).
  

  
Two time Olympian Chad Vaughn finished with a 326kg total to take bronze in the 77kg class.

Yesterday Kendrick Farris had a decent day taking bronze in the 85kg category. There was some kind of issue either with the display of the meet clock on the back, or his coaches not keeping an eye on it. In any case, he had to run out for his third attempt snatch. Kendrick came out and missed the jerk on his opener at 190kg, then hit 191kg on the second attempt. It looks like he&#8217;s back to doing his hybrid split/squat hybrid jerk instead of the squat jerk. He came out for the third attempt when his name was on the monitor, and we saw the judge tell him the bar wasn&#8217;t ready and to go back in the warm-up room. It&#8217;s possible that another lifter&#8217;s coaches changed their weight at the last second to dick Kendrick over, but either way his coaching team should have had better situation awareness. There was less than ten seconds when he ran from the curtain and he ended up getting his hands on the bar with one second left, and only clean pulled a deadlift. Despite these goofs, he still made bronze.

Jon North and Jared Fleming competed in the 94kg class. They both missed their third snatch with both hitting 155 on the second attempt. Jon hit his opener at 178kg and Jared missed his opening clean on 180k. Jared attempted 180 again, had a better front squat, then the jerk drove him down, and he had to stabilize it for about five seconds for a good lift. Jon then flexed for the camera and shouted &#8220;Shankle&#8221; before his second attempt at 183. It was a hard front squat, and then I wrote this:
  
Hit jerk, hopped around like a frog. Then tried to shake the judges hand and was denied????
  

  
They both attempted 190 on their third attempt. I noted that Jared had a great clean and front squat, but the jerk was just too heavy today. Jon went after Jared and was talking to himself, saying &#8220;Klokov&#8221;, &#8220;Steiner&#8221;, and &#8220;Ali&#8221;. I wrote &#8220;real hard clean&#8221; and &#8220;jerk too heavy today&#8221;. Jon finished in 4th place overall and Jared in 5th place overall.

70&#8217;s Big will be posting updates on the Facebook Fan Page and Twitter for today&#8217;s sessions and I&#8217;ll post a link in those two places for a live IRC chat as well.
  

  
Lastly, if you are someone who thinks that the sport of weightlifting needs to grow &#8212; or that you have BITCHED about it&#8217;s lack of growth or talked shit about the USAW, then this is the time to support it. I&#8217;ve already seen people bad mouth our lifters on my own Facebook page as if not competing well internationally is a reason to not support our lifters. I suppose these same people supported the fucking Taliban too. Nevertheless, share and watch the live feed, spread the pictures I&#8217;m posting on the Fan Page, share the results, and spread it around. If you have ever bitched about the sport&#8217;s lack of participation, then do something about it when events like this happen. Otherwise you&#8217;re a hypocrite and a pussy. Every CrossFitter should have at least a vague interest in this sport, and there&#8217;s no reason not to have a nice following for our lifters today. Good luck to them &#8212; let&#8217;s get some more medals.
