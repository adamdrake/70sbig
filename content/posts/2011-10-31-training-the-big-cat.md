This post was written by my pal AJ. I got to hang out with him a bit at USAPL Raw Nationals in Scranton earlier this year. His biceps are pretty decent. On a similar note, he coaches strength training and powerlifting in south Florida. This post is about one of his female lifters, (who he refers to as) &#8220;Big Cat&#8221;, who came to him with some hyper mobility issues yet has progressed very well in her 10 months of lifting.

The Big Cat came into Just Lift to ‘tighten up’. Not in <a href="http://youtu.be/cvP7cnmxlLM?t=55s" target="_blank">this kind</a> of way, but in the ‘my joints are fucked up from BJJ and need to stop being so mobile’ kind of way. I&#8217;ve never really heard of this, but whatever we’re <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Just-Lift/116645658515" target="_blank">Just Lift Powerlifting Team</a> so we’ll take in anyone who wants to be there. She wanted to lift, so I threw her at the weights and Starting Strength. By the way, I&#8217;m a &#8220;Starting Strength Coach&#8221;, the seminar was fucking great, and now I’m a good coach.
  

  
Big Cat already wanted to be in the gym, so there wasn&#8217;t much need for extra motivation. In her first round of programming she did the good old 3 sets of 5 reps, with little drama aside from some tricky shoulder joints requiring some extra warming up and an occasional rub to loosen up. She <a href="http://vimeo.com/24700100" target="_blank">high bar squatted</a> early on because of her shoulders and lack of traps and rear delts to hold the bar, but now she’s got a shelf that would make the <a href="/shrugthug" target="_blank">Shrug Thug</a> proud and no longer has issues holding the bar low.
  

  
We eventually got her to squat consistently without collapsing at the bottom. At first she would take some repetitions as &#8220;opportunities&#8221; to either go too deep or forget what she was doing and literally drop to the floor requiring some interesting spotting efforts and removing the bar from her back completely (we eventually got the hint and used side spotters). Her inability to recover from troublesome squat reps got better and now the Big Cat is capable of actually grinding reps out without going limp.

Her lifts were pretty straight forward; a solid deadlift, a strong, fairly wide-stance squat and finally a decent bench and press (when there wasn’t much shoulder pain). The Big Cat picked up a bunch of strength in the first few weeks, making good consistent progress once she figured out how to balance. It became clear that her athletic background gave her a good foundation of strength.
  

  
Oh, by the way, don’t ever turn your back on the Big Cat – you might be sitting on the bench talking about the fat pump you just caught doing rows for the bros and she’ll sneak up behind you and put you in a choke hold till you’re unconscious. The gym is a dangerous jungle.
  

  
After a few short months of training the Big Cat wanted to show off her strength and dominate other lesser domesticated animals. She had to work hard to make weight, and may have done so in a manner that wasn’t the safest; she may have fallen onto a hard object and showed up on meet day with bloody teeth (good intimidation for the other ladies lifting). This isn’t a meet recap so I’ll keep it quick: the ferocious Big Cat had a great first competition. Even with her coaches lack of attention she nailed a 242lb squat, 143lb bench and 297lb deadlift (above) weighing 132lbs. She had a bunch left in each lift, but we took it easy for her first comp. Did we mention she was the best female lifter? PRETTY FUCKING STRONG, eh?
  

  
Outside of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Just-Lift/116645658515" target="_blank">Just Lift</a>, Big Cat started noticing her legs where truly kicking ass. Sith her now more powerful legs she was taking chumps by surprise when getting hot and dirty in BJJ.

_AJ points out a few things regarding women training. I&#8217;ll summarize them in a list:
  
&#8211; Addressing hyper mobility with strength training (learning proper end ROM)
  
&#8211; Big Cat didn&#8217;t need motivation
  
&#8211; Used high bar until shoulders and musculature allowed for low bar position
  
&#8211; The squat and muscle control evolved from &#8220;loose&#8221; and &#8220;collapsing at the bottom&#8221; to tight and controlled
  
&#8211; New types of balance and control were learned (in addition to the non-barbell balance developed in BJJ)
  
&#8211; This newfound strength and stability helped augment another sport_
