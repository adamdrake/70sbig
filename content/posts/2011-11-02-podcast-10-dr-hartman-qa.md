In this podcast I talk with <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Michael Hartman</a>, a college professor, weightlifting coach, sport scientist, and new father. We also collaborated with Dr. Lon Kilgore to create a strength training, endurance, and fitness resource called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a> (I&#8217;ve been using the strength chapter to plan advanced lifting programs).

    Hartman as Ditka says LISTEN TO THE PODCAST

We talk a little bit about FIT, but also talk about weightlifting in the Pan American Games last week and the upcoming weightlifting World Championships occurring next week in Paris. There&#8217;s some time spent on talking about Kendrick Farris, how he did at Pan Ams, his jerk, and when Hartman met him as a school age lifter. Then we get into various questions about weightlifting including hitting a solid rack position in the snatch, push-pressing, rack position in the push-press and jerk, and possibly doing an old-time weightlifting meet with the clean and press, snatch, and clean and jerk. This podcast flows very well and has a lot of good information in it.

_There&#8217;s still something goofy happening with iTunes despite my podcast submission. Will let you know when it&#8217;s working._ 

Feel free to ask questions about Dr. Hartman, the podcast, or weightlifting here. Good questions will be used for Friday&#8217;s Q&A, and you can ask them to Dr. Hartman too.
