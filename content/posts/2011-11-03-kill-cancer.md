November is a magical month. Men across the world will forgo the confusing art of shaving and develop impressive and intense facial hair. Some may call it &#8220;No Shave November&#8221;. We have called it Novemburly. Many know it as Movember. Either way, you&#8217;re participating.
  

  
Movember started in 1999 and has developed into a month-long fundraiser for men&#8217;s health, particularly cancer. Cancer is a pestilent adversary and 70&#8217;s Big is joining the fight to kick it in the BALLS. Combine fighting and facial hair, and we&#8217;re there. However, this time it&#8217;s to raise money.
  

  
There are two ways you can participate: either create a profile and join the 70&#8217;s Big Fundraising team on us.movember.com, or donate to the team or one of our members. Either way, <a href="http://us.movember.com/mospace/1715536/" target="_blank">click here</a> and get started (the team is on the right).
  
**Edit: Even if you only donate one doll-hair, that will help. Various team members will be doing amusing things for donations, so keep an eye out.**

**Contest Prizes**
  
Whoever raises the most money on the 70&#8217;s Big Movember Team will receive $50 bucks, a 70&#8217;s Big t-shirt, and their choice of one of my e-books or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a>. That&#8217;s right &#8212; raise the most money for a badass cause, grow some facial hair, AND get cash and 70&#8217;s Big gear. I&#8217;M GOING TO PAY YOU TO GROW FACIAL HAIR, SO GET STARTED.
  

  
**Do I need to grow a mustache?**
  
Movember emphasizes shaving at the beginning of the month and growing a mustache. Since Jacob Cloud and I already have sweet facial hair, we&#8217;re certainly not going to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmFnarFSj_U" target="_blank">SHAVE</a> it. Instead, grow whatever you want. If you have a beard, show it off. If you don&#8217;t, then either grow a &#8216;stache or don&#8217;t shave all month. Pick one, join the fundraising team, and LET&#8217;S FUCKING KILL CANCER.
  

  
And now a word from co-captain Jacob Cloud and his cat Weezer:
