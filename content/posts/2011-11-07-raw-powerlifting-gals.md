Monday&#8217;s are dedicated to displaying or helping female lifters and trainees. Today&#8217;s feature is a couple more regular women who are pretty damn strong. Jen Higgins of <a href="http://www.crossfitworks.com" target="_blank">CrossFit Works</a> sent me the e-mail but was mostly talking about how great of a lifter Liz Cameron is.
  

  
This is Liz pulling 286.5 lbs (130kg) weighing 114 (52kg weight class).

That&#8217;s pretty solid technique for a max rep, especially for a female (round backs are the norm). Jen told me how Liz is about half her age, but was a great training partner as they readied for the 100% RAW Single Lift Worlds in Las Vegas. Liz&#8217;s best competition bench is 150lbs and her best competition squat is 220 (weighing 110). Liz has won the Best Female Lifter in the two meets that she&#8217;s competed in! She also teaches salsa dancing and apparently is &#8220;frequently sighted in short dresses and high heels&#8221;. Jen conveniently didn&#8217;t send pics of this claim.
  

  
All of this is high praise from Jen Higgins as she is also pretty damn strong. Here&#8217;s a video of her pulling a really clean looking 292.1 lbs (132.5 kg) in the 123 lbs/56kg weight class.

Well done, ladies.
