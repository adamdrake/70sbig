Veteran&#8217;s Day is a holiday that is formerly called Armistice Day that commemorates the armistice between the Allies and Germany in World War I. It took effect on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. In the Commonwealth it&#8217;s known as Remembrance Day to remember those that have died in the line of duty. In the United States it honors all military veterans.

There are many different types of jobs that military servicemen can hold, but the common theme among them is sacrifice. The infantryman sacrifices for long months in the most barren areas of the world. He sacrifices years of his life in combat zones and sacrifices bodily harm &#8212; some more so than others. Some are hit by flak, some are blown up, some are shot. Some are medevaced and some are patched up and step outside the wire again because they can&#8217;t bear the thought of letting their friends down. He sacrifices his emotion as he leaves the combat and steps back into civilization. Many sacrifice their ability to un-see their friends falling apart and killed in front of them. Others wish that it were them instead and live with the guilt that they survived and others didn&#8217;t.
  

  
The medic, the corpsman, the nurse sacrifices daily to keep friends and strangers alive. They may live with the horror of losing someone in their care, whether the victim could have been saved or not. The maintainer works on aircraft, vehicles, and other pieces of equipment that others rely on. They pull extended duty to make the impossible happen whether at home or deployed. They keep the world functioning for pilots and drivers. They provide covering fire as door gunners, they ensure the safety of their cargo, whether it&#8217;s human or supplies. They sacrifice back-breaking hours and efforts to assist those in the direct action, often finding themselves in the thick of it.
  

  
The special operations units engage in dangerous missions, putting their lives at risk daily for recognition that they will never receive. The things that they accomplish are hardly televised, they will never receive thanks, and often their job isn&#8217;t known or understood by a civilian. And they wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way.
  

  
Above all, each soldier, Marine, sailor, and airman sacrifices freedom. They are held to higher standards, meticulous laws and orders. They are taken from their families and often miss their children being born or growing up. They cannot travel on a whim and are underpaid. They lose relationships, break their bodies, and struggle with their memories. They know their country will never fully pay them back for everything that they&#8217;ve sacrificed. They lose the freedoms and liberties that a civilian takes for granted, but in the end&#8230;they, above all, earn that freedom.
  

  
Some veterans still find it odd to be thanked for what they do, but they should know that the thanks is there.
  

  
It&#8217;s also PR Friday. Post training updates or PRs to comments. Weight is irrelevant &#8212; you don&#8217;t have to be strong as everyone else to post here, just work hard. What is your least favorite lift to do?

> At first glance this makes sense. But then I realized that when comparing hip/shoulder width pulls, this will probably turn out to be minor. Your legs being narrower, lengthens the pulling distance because you are standing up taller. Thereby negating the lengthening of the arms by having them more vertical. So unless your anthropometry is really weird (long arms, long femurs, and short tibias), it stands to reason that it would even out.

Dear wreeder,
  

  
Your analysis is a correct one, yet it ignores muscular action in this movement. Remember that the more narrow stance allows for more external rotation in the hips (since the knees should be touching the inside of the arms). I&#8217;ll remind everyone that this external rotation a) prevents hip impingement with the femur and the ASIS (hip bone) which b) allows the lower back (lumbar/sacral) to be extended better and set for an optimal pulling position compared to a slightly more rounded position had the knees not been pushed out, c) contracts the external rotators creating some torque and tightness around the hips, and d) stretches the adductors and subsequently hamstrings more so that they have tension in the starting position and subsequently in the early part of the pull off the floor.
  

  
There was a guy in the 83kg class in the IPF World Championships that had a wide stance and wide grip, and he missed his second and third attempts about three or four inches from lockout. There&#8217;s no way to say why this could have been, however the wider grip is not doing him any favors. A lifter who has continuously deadlifted with sub-optimal mechanics will develop musculature to support this movement. Such a lifter may not pull more if he adjusts his feet and grip width, yet most readers here are not advanced to the point of havingbalanced strength and musculature, and following the &#8220;stance/grip width&#8221; information provided here, they will more fully develop their musculature for general strength or powerlifting.

Dear artesuave,
  

  
I&#8217;m not a fan of any relatively inexperienced lifter (under 12 to 18 months) excessively rounding their back just to pull a heavier weight. Powerlifting is different as the point is to lift more weight, not do it correctly to develop strength evenly through a full ROM. If these girls are not competing and are within my above time frame for _consistent lifting_ (dabbling in CrossFit doesn&#8217;t count), then I would rather see them develop their posterior chains so that they can lift correctly. Developing and strengthening the posterior chain will help improve their shitty-round-back-deadlifts anyway.
  

  
I see this a lot in CrossFit: girls will have developed quads and no posterior chain due to the vertical emphasis in all squatting within CF (high bar, front squat, overhead, &#8216;air squat&#8217;, lunges, pistols, etc.). Furthermore, they think that just because they can pull decent amounts of weight that their posterior chain is strong. Not so. I have friends who can pull lots of weight, albeit pretty rounded, and they could stand to strengthen their hamstrings (to the benefit of everything, including the deadlift).
  

  
Since women typically lack a background in lifting, I will have them <a href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/" target="_blank">RDL</a> consistently (at least once a week). Use 3&#215;8 or 3&#215;10 every week, and focus on the technique and muscle action instead of driving the weight up. Once the weight progression slows, use 3&#215;5 for strength, yet still focusing on the technique. The same goes for guys if they can&#8217;t pull heavy weight with decent technique.

Dear lunamud,
  

  
Sure. Women typically don&#8217;t have good posterior development or strength and often pull with a round back. See the previous question.

> Hi Justin,

> I have a question I was hoping you could help me with, for a couple of weeks I’ve been thinking about the nervous system and its role in weightlifting, in essence the question is do you think that it would be helpful to take some sort of supplement to help boost neurotransmitters before workouts? I try to keep supplements to a minimum but in this case I am unsure and would really appreciate your opinion. 

Dear Jonas,
  

  
It&#8217;s a misconception in modern online fitness and strength communities to say &#8220;my CNS (central nervous system) is burned out&#8221;. This is a silly simplification of a system that that integrates the information that it receives and coordinates the activity of the body. Instead, we should think in terms of the &#8220;neuroendocrine system&#8221; because it concerns the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. To say, &#8220;my CNS is fried&#8221; is just a pseudo-intellectual way of saying &#8220;I experienced too much stress and now my system is suppressed&#8221;. The &#8220;achy&#8221; feeling that you may have from high volume or high intensity is a combination of the high localized stress imparted on individual muscles or groups of muscles compounded with the fact that recovery processes are in a chronic deficit as a result of not getting a chance to recover and supercompensate.
  

  
So, in other words, the nervous system is merely a piece of the giant, complex, fascinating system that makes the body. When we combine this beautiful system with stress to improve its performance, things are even more complicated than they already are. I know this firsthand after seeing a dissected body and observing it&#8217;s complexity in anatomical structure. To give you an idea of how complicated metabolism is, look at <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ojAVykXqU5w/TiEuaJK5z6I/AAAAAAAAAEo/o6LbhUeq7ws/s400/Complete+metabolic+map_2.jpg" target="_blank">this thumbnail</a> for a wall map (the map is probably 5&#215;5 in feet, at least). Now compound all of that craziness with how we are applying stress and changing variables through training, eating, supplementation, sleep, stress, rehab, recovery, rest, and more. It&#8217;s really fucking complicated, and cannot be simplified in terms of the CNS. So stop saying that (getting off soap box).
  

  
Now, going back to Jonas&#8217; question, worrying about what your neurotransmitters are doing is like worrying about the left pinky finger of one soldier of the 300,000 Persians attacking the Greeks at the Battle of Thermopylae &#8212; it&#8217;s irrelevant. Are you ample enough <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">protein</a>? Are you sleeping at LEAST 8 hours a night? Are you on a good program? Is your body fat under control? Have you been lifting consistently for at least two years? Are you supplementing vitamins, minerals, fish oil, BCAAs, and possibly creatine effectively?
  

  
If you answered &#8220;no&#8221; to any of those questions (along with many more similar questions), then you have no business worrying about this. At all.
  

  
All right, well it&#8217;s been fun guys. I&#8217;ll talk to you here in a little bit. Be on the lookout for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a>/<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> posts on the IWF and IPF World Championships.
