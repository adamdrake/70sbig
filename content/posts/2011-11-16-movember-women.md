This is a list of people already on the 70&#8217;s Big Movember Team who are yet to raise any doll hairs:
  

  
Will Cook, Wayne Reeder, Ryan Buck, Ryan Berube, Pete Townley, Neil Sater, Luke Smith, Kevin Diaz, Justin Coons, Jeremy Shepard, Jay Stadtfeld and Jake Golovchuk (my homies, c&#8217;mon!), J.T. Matherly, Iman Crawford, Foster Scott Devine, Eli Weber, David Sharp, David Hagrety, Daniel Villava, Craig Kilgo, BJ Fox, Bill Clark, Ben Urich, Andrew Swisher, and Aamir Syed.
  

  
Gentlemen, if you do your part in raising some doll hairs, it will help 70&#8217;s Big reach its goal of $5,000. I challenge each one of you to raise $100.
  

  
**Women Can Join the Fundraising Team**
  
This isn&#8217;t solely a guys-only thing. Women, you can join the 70&#8217;s Big Movember Team and help raise money as well. No, you don&#8217;t need a friggin&#8217; mustache and I prefer that you don&#8217;t have facial hair. If you&#8217;re a fan of dicks, cocks, or penises (or the utility thereof), then help us raise money for the cause. This won&#8217;t be the first 70&#8217;s Big fundraiser, so we&#8217;ll scratch your back (although most of us supported breast cancer awareness). I&#8217;m sure the few women who join the team will undoubtedly be better at this fundraising stuff than the majority of guys on the team.
  
**Edit: What I mean by this is that women can create a profile just like the guys have. I believe the site calls it being a &#8220;MoSista&#8221; whereas guys are &#8220;MoBros&#8221;. You then could join the team like anyone else, and then have people donate to you specifically. When you are a part of the team, that total would go to the team as well. And you could win the money/book/t-shirt prize too.** 
  

  
**What Do you Want**
  
Do you want silly stuff? I&#8217;ve got silly stuff for you. Here&#8217;s a video of me hitting a mob. There&#8217;s no relevance whatsoever, other than I do it with a mustache, but maybe it will give you an idea of the lengths we&#8217;re willing to go to raise money. Or something.

**Lift-a-thons?**
  
Patrick Stroup, Jacob Cloud, and I have already stated that we&#8217;re willing to do some kind of lift-a-thon. Jacob does some deadlifts in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-xihPL0gN4" target="_blank">THIS VIDEO</a>, and Stroup is going to do squats and yell whatever obscenities that you submit with your donation. Instead, I&#8217;ll do clean and jerks. I&#8217;m thinking that for every $50 raised to the team from this point on (current total is $2,683, we&#8217;ll round it to 2,700 to keep it even). If you want a phrase shouted with the weight overhead, then include that in your donation (regardless of the person you donate it to). I&#8217;m sure Stroup and Cloud will join back in the fun for lift-a-thons. It&#8217;s your chance to kill us.
  

  
**14 Days of Movember Left**
  
We only have two weeks. In the first two weeks we raised a bit over $2,500, so the goal is to raise $5,000. I&#8217;m killing my dignity (see video above) and willing to do up to fifty reps on the clean and jerk. Let&#8217;s get it done.
