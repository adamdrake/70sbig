I&#8217;m in a hurry today, so this will be quick. Lately there has been more &#8220;dicking around&#8221; posts because I&#8217;ve been juggling various projects. If you e-mailed be about a consultation, I&#8217;ll get to you soon, but these projects won&#8217;t get done if I keep pushing them back. In the mean time, let&#8217;s watch some random vids:
  

  
My friend Jake from Chicago sent me this Kazmaier video. I have no idea what the context is, but I know it&#8217;s part of a film/documentary called &#8220;Tom Magee: Man of Iron&#8221;. This is the only part that Kazmaier is in. He seems kind of like a dickhead in this, but he obviously doesn&#8217;t act like that anymore. It&#8217;s still funny.

Here is some footage of some 77 and 85 lifters in the training hall at the World Weightlifting Championships from the last couple weeks. Fast.

Here is Rybakov snatching his second and third attempts (175 and 178) in the B session for the 85s. He&#8217;s the World Record holder and one gold in the event, yet his cj is low and wasn&#8217;t in the A session. He placed 7th overall and cj&#8217;d 190, 19kg lower than the best cj.
