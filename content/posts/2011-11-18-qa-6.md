Happy PR Friday to you, sir. Or madame. Whatever. Post your PRs and training updates to the comments. Last week I asked what your least favorite lift was, and it seems that most of you hate front squats.
  
What is your biggest muscular weakness?

This wasn&#8217;t really a question, but I just thought I&#8217;d point out how a <a href="/blog/2011/10/pressing-a-dead-horse/" target="_blank">proper grip</a> on the press makes it mechanically efficient and properly utilizes the musculature of the triceps and shoulders.

Dear Terrible,
  

  
You won&#8217;t need to &#8220;pull around your knees&#8221; in a mechanically sound starting position that is followed by &#8220;pushing the floor away&#8221;. Methinks your butt is too low and stance potentially wide (see <a href="/blog/2011/11/04/" target="_blank">Q&A-4</a> for stance info). If you were able to get your knees out a bit with your shoulders slightly in front of the bar (putting your scapulae over the bar), then push the floor away, then you won&#8217;t have this &#8220;KNEES KNEES KNEES&#8221; business. Long femurs usually means long arms, so you could get by with a grip that is a finger width or so outside of the inside rings (the rings where the knurling starts in the center of the bar). The wider grip would allow your knees to shove out a bit more.
  

  
Keep in mind your musculature won&#8217;t currently be adapted to lift heavy weight well with the conventional technique if you&#8217;ve been doing sumo. In fact, I&#8217;d wager you have a hamstring weakness. But, like I said in the reply to your comment, send a video and I can say things definitively.

> A question for Justin: a quick wikipeida WR comparison between the classes shows that the heavier the class the lower the total kg:class kg ratio. For example – the 56kg class shows a total that is 5.44 times the lifters body weight, but the 105kg class is 4.15. Why does this happen? Is it because the lower weight classes are shorter and don’t have to move the weight as far?

Dear echo,
  

  
There is not a direct correlation with body weight and strength among a population of lifters. There still is a correlation, but it isn&#8217;t linear. As with any physical attribute, there are diminishing returns. It&#8217;s just what happens. For example, my Facebook friend Klokov went 196/232 for a 428 total. If it were possible to replicate the 5.44xBW total of the 56kg class, that would mean about a 570 total. If his snatch were 84% of his clean and jerk (like in the WWC a few days ago), that would result in him snatching 260 and clean and jerking 310 to make a 570 total. Numerically we can see that this isn&#8217;t possible given that 260 is near the clean and jerk WR.
  

  
In any case, how many times the BW a lifter can lift is irrelevant since absolute weight is what matters. And even when it does &#8212; like in the Sinclair formula &#8212; larger amounts of musculature matter since Akkaev and Klokov (105kg lifters) placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in the Sinclair formula for the WWC.

> Justin, for someone training 2 days per week who wants to try and linearly progress on press and bench, would going to 5&#215;5 sets across be helpful? Just wondering if the bump in volume would offset the reduced frequency.

Paul has decreased his training frequency cause he&#8217;s about to be a daddy. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of using 5x5s in general, but especially when that lift is only done once a week. The 5&#215;5 inherently uses a low percentage of the 1RM, and creeping it up over time would primarily get someone adapted to lower percentage, high volume lifting. Instead, I&#8217;d suggest using one week of an ascending 3&#215;5 and a second week of an ascending 3&#215;3. The bench and press, especially the press, respond well to encountering some heavier weights. In fact, this is the strategy I&#8217;ve used for at least 8 months, and I&#8217;ve PR&#8217;d at 350 on the bench and 240 on the press (with 250 in reach, methinks, but I&#8217;m currently focusing on the push-press).
  

  
Ascending sets will let you hit a higher weight on the third set, yet it should be done systematically. I suggest using 10 pound jumps as it will allow for more weight on the third compared to only increasing by 5 pounds (15 would be too large, especially on press). If you have a weak press, 10 pounds would be a greater percentage of your lift, so you could always use 7 or 5 pound jumps. I also like 10 pound jumps on the ascending 3&#215;3.
  

  
The good thing about this set up is that every 5 or 7 weeks you could always single on up. It&#8217;s a way to test the 1RM (if you want), but it also provides an extremely high percentage stress that usually resonates well when going back to the regular press sets. I never systematically used singles; whenever I got into PR territory with the top triple or set of five, I would try a single. Earlier this year I was only hitting around 215 for a triple, and then I used it for a set of five before attempting the 240 press (previous PR was 230). I typically pressed Monday, benched Wednesday, and use weighted dips on Friday (after sn/cj, or something like that).
  

  
I write more about this method in the Texas Method: Part 2 e-book that is almost done (I finished writing the last chapter yesterday), so be on the lookout for that.

Dear EVERYONE,
  

  
Several of us will be doing something to raise money and reach our goal of $5,000. I will be doing one clean and jerk for every $50 raised (starting with the total on Wednesday morning) at the end of the month, Stroup is going to be deadlifting or something fucking stupid, Cloud is going to be abiding, and Paul Sousa is gonna be watching Twilight (I would never agree to that shit). I really don&#8217;t know the specifics despite the fact that Stroup, Cloud, Brent, Briskin, and I chatted for two hours the other night. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll put up a post clarifying what we&#8217;ll be doing so you know where your donation money is going.

> I&#8217;ve been thinking about using snatch grip for my DE Deadlifts for the increased R.O.M. Is this stupid, smart or are you indifferent?

Dear the Mark,
  

  
I know that you are a powerlifter, so the first thing that comes to mind is, &#8220;How will these benefit you more than regular speed deadlifts?&#8221; You&#8217;ll use less weight with abnormal mechanics. The good thing with how I would normally program someone with intermediate deadlifting programming is that they pull a full ROM deadlift 3 times a month (with the other week being rack pulls, most likely) and that&#8217;s accomplished with speed pulling &#8212; more on this in Texas Method Part 2 e-book.
  

  
If you are keen to try it, then let me know how it goes. If I were coaching you I&#8217;d have you work with regular speed pulls, emphasizing the fast lockout (after the knees) as it&#8217;s more applicable. I&#8217;d consider snatch grip stuff worthy of a try for a powerlifter later in their advancement, if at all. This doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t be beneficial, but after my analysis, I&#8217;d rather you use conventional style. 

All right, that&#8217;s good for today. I&#8217;ll see you guys on the field.
