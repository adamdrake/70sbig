The TL;DR of this post can be summed up in this vid (if you just want the good stuff, skip to <a href="http://youtu.be/VwAr5m9_iO0?t=3m10s" target="_blank">3:10</a>)

As of this writing, we have raised $3,922. The goal is $5,000. I&#8217;m not above wearing a speedo to raise some doll hairs, but only if we eclipse the 5k mark. Here is what a few of us are doing. If anybody else wants to get in on the donation festivities, put it in the comments. Here are the top raisers in the team. I&#8217;ll remind you that the best raiser not named Jacob will win cash and prizes.

**Justin&#8217;s Money Raising**
  
I will be doing one clean and jerk for ever $50 raised starting from the amount when I announced it ($2,700) till the end of the month. So far I have 24 reps to do. I originally said I was going to do 300 lbs, but that may have to change if it gets around 50 reps. I&#8217;ll probably do as many as I can at 300 and go from there. I&#8217;m not doing them in a row, but instead spacing them out. I&#8217;ll probably stream the event as well as record stuff because I&#8217;ll be doing it at a local CrossFit. **Also, if we reach $5,000 I&#8217;ll do it in a speedo.**

**Jacob&#8217;s Money Raising** 
  
Jacob is going to do a max set of squats at 315. He&#8217;ll take pledges for &#8220;amount of doll hairs per rep&#8221; prior to the set, and when he finishes, the pledging donators will pay their pledge x reps. **All of Jacob&#8217;s efforts are dedicated to his friend Mike Gardner who died of brain cancer. Rest in peace, Mike.**

**Paul&#8217;s Money Raising**
  
Paul said that if he eclipsed $300, then he would watch a Twilight marathon. Jesus Christ. I would never agree to that. I&#8217;d rather do a 12 mile ruck in the middle of summer. He&#8217;s going to record his thoughts and I&#8217;ll put them on the site after.
  

  
Paul is also going to do a max rep set of whatever value he raises. Right now he&#8217;s at 310, so he&#8217;ll add $5 and do 315 for reps if he doesn&#8217;t raise anything. If it gets over $440, he&#8217;ll attempt a new PR as 440 is his current best.

**Stroup&#8217;s Money Raising**
  
Stroup is doing a squat-a-thon type thing where you can purchase a squat rep with $2 donation. He will also shout whatever obscenity or phrase you want at the top of the rep if you clarify with your donation. He&#8217;s up to 12 reps.
  
<a href="http://us.movember.com/mospace/1723662/" target="_blank">Donate to Stroup here</a>.
  

  
**If we don&#8217;t raise $5,000, then you&#8217;ll have to see Jacob, Stroup, and Paul in a speedo.** I didn&#8217;t ask them, and Paul said, &#8220;I am far too hairy to don a speedo in public. It would look like I was smuggling Snoop Doggs afro in my shorts.&#8221; If we raise 5k doll hairs, then they are off the hook for this.
  

  
**Bill&#8217;s Money raising**
  
Bill Clark is a martial artist and breaks things with his hands. If you donate 10 to $20, he&#8217;ll break a brick with your name on it. If you donate $21 or more, he&#8217;ll break a coconut with your name on it (he&#8217;ll be breaking them with his hands). He&#8217;ll video them and upload them to YouTube and I will post them on the site.

## Every doll hair counts, even if it&#8217;s just a few. Thanks for your donations.
