I compiled the results of seven competitors not including me. I expected a few more, but I knew there was only a few non-pussies that read this site anyway. Oh, and domjo54 commented and said that he wanted to do it but didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d be fair? What the hell, man? You ate two dinners, so fucking what? This better not be the type of jelly dick reasoning you use to not enter a meet or competition. YOU&#8217;RE BETTER THAN THAT.
  

  
It was funny seeing the difference in people in the post-eating weigh-in. They were lethargic, possibly drunk, and not as lively. Several of them even commented how their math was totally off (mine was too, but because I forgot my previous weight).
  

  
Anyway, I did a little filming for funsies. I&#8217;ve never been confused with a competitive eater and only gain two pounds in about 50 minutes. As usual, there&#8217;s more to the vid for your enjoyment:

Brian AKA criedthefox wins the &#8220;Funniest Video Award&#8221;, hands down. Here is his video:

HarveyMushman wrecked shop and won the Absolute Weight Gain Award by gaining 10 pounds in 4 hours (222.6 to 232.6). Despite being larger than most of the competitors, he also gained the most weight as a percentage of body weight (4.49%), but you can only win one award so it goes to someone else. Here&#8217;s Harvey&#8217;s vid &#8212; his wife is funny and he also throws in a &#8220;We&#8217;re doing it live&#8221;:

This puts my friend Elliot into the lead with the Percent of Body Weight Gain Award with 4.16%. He was also wearing a singlet.

The shortest pre/post weigh-in was accomplished by Thomas Wywrot, and he gained 5.4 pounds going from 183.8 to 189.2. He wins the Greatest Gain in the Shortest Amount of Time Award. He ate a lot of Ukranian food, which looked awesome. His fiance also hits a front single bi pose at the end. Here&#8217;s his vid:

Here are the rankings for Absolute and Percent Weight Gained (everyone didn&#8217;t record times, so I&#8217;m not ranking it):

Other notables are:
  
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPzSLBdz-Sw" target="_blank">Daren</a>, who sharted while squatting that morning and has a nice Movember stache. He also recently cleaned up his body composition amidst getting stronger but that didn&#8217;t stop him from gaining 7.2 pounds and 4.06% BW.
  

  
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viKO220mXcU" target="_blank">Kittensmash</a>, who almost won funniest video. Watch his first weigh-in (overall, he gains 8.4 lbs, 3.57% BW).
  

  
My buddy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhBYuPUIjkg&#038;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Yosh</a> would have won creepiest video since we don&#8217;t see his face and he doesn&#8217;t talk. He gained 6.8 lbs and 3.51% BW.
  

  
Thanks to everyone for participating.
