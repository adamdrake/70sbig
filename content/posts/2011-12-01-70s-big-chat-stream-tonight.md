The first 70&#8217;s Big chat in a long time will be tonight at 6:00 PM EST and coincides with the Movember Lift-a-thon I&#8217;m doing. I (regrettably) agreed to do one clean and jerk for every $50 raised when we were at the $2700 mark. That means I have 72 reps to do this evening during the chat, and it&#8217;ll be streamed live.

Thanks to Adam at <a href="http://www.panhandlecrossfit.com/" target="_blank">Panhandle CrossFit</a> for allowing me to act like a stooge in his gym tonight.

There will be a chance for Q&A during the chat, but most people like to mingle with 70&#8217;s Big folk.
