Last Friday one of history&#8217;s greatest weightlifters died at the age of 69. Vasily Alekseyev won two Olympic gold medals, eight World Championships, and set 80 World Records. Yes, 80. He was the first man to clean and jerk 500 pounds, and the first to total 600kg (when the clean and press was still in competition). He also had one of the first legitimate power bellies in strength sports. I&#8217;ll recap his life by linking various articles that have been published in the last few days, including two by <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Michael Hartman</a> and <a href="http://www.theironsamurai.com/" target="_blank">Nick Horton</a>.

> **“The ‘Babe Ruth’ of Olympic Weightlifting”** is how I described Vasily Alexeev to my wife over the weekend when I learned of his passing. Winning 8 world championships (1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1977), 2 Olympic gold medals (1972 and 1976), while setting 80 World records, and basically going unbeaten for the eight years at the peak of his career is a testament to his strength, power, and ability in the sport…doing so in a very competitive weight class, while being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, and profiled on Wide World of Sports is a testament to his legacy and fame.

Dr. Hartman also has some cool pics, including the famed &#8220;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-w7RaDH7HBdk/TtP7R9UjbKI/AAAAAAAAAaw/ctbcDKnkMog/s320/Alexeev1.jpg" target="_blank">Alekseyev doing cleans in the water</a>&#8221; photo. There is also a photo set by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bklemens/sets/72157626392362845/" target="_blank">Bruce Klemens</a> (one of the photos is below).

> His best ever snatch was 190k.
  
> His best ever Clean and Jerk was 256k.
  
> His best ever Clean and Press (they did that still in the early part of his career) was 236.5k!

Horton also compiled a thorough list of YouTube videos of Alekseyev that include some of his big lifts, some documentaries, and a video of him water skiing like a boss.

> “For some performers, there is a psychological problem,” he told Sports Illustrated. “As the weight is greater, the more the mind makes the weight seem to be. But we are from the U.S.S.R., and such a psychological situation is no problem. To successfully lift the weight cannot be avoided. I experience the tortures and the celebration. But I lift as well as I lift because it cannot be avoided.”

This article also details Alekseyev&#8217;s dad was a lumberjack, how his last couple meets went, and how he enjoys reading.
  

  
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Alekseyev" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> talks about his life after lifting, which included coaching and was elected into the IWF Hall of Fame. His <a href="http://chidlovski.net/liftup/l_athleteResult.asp?a_id=5" target="_blank">profile on Lift Up</a> includes all of his World Records and when they were set. During his eight year reign, he hit multiple World Records every year. We will never again see an athlete this dominant in the sport of weightlifting. Rest in peace, Vasily.
