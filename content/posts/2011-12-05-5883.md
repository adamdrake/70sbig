This is just a small collection of videos that can help motivate the female readers. Also, I&#8217;m taking topic requests for this Monday column; I have a few ideas but my list doesn&#8217;t have much on it right now.
  
_Edit: It was hard to find decent lifting videos of chicks when you don&#8217;t know names to search._ 
  

  
This first video is probably more for the fellas, but it shows some world class and American weightlifters:

This one is a random video of a Canadian gal who is doing a log clean and push press with 110 pounds.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrLsyXTTLyU&#038;feature=related" target="_blank">This video</a> is pretty good of a girl squatting 135kg weighing 56kg (embedding is disabled). And while we&#8217;re text linking stuff, don&#8217;t fucking drop your bar like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=don7aNiNALA&#038;feature=related" target="_blank">this girl</a>.
  

  
This chick squats up to 295&#215;2 with a Gordon behind her and shitty camera work:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&#038;v=E8KHFNVxzu4" target="_blank">This one</a> is more of what NOT to do, but it&#8217;s really good. 

This is a girl squatting who ran SS for a while. The bar positioning is kind of off, but still pretty good squats:
