I&#8217;m busy editing the chapters for the _Texas Method: Part II_ e-book and don&#8217;t have anything lifting-related for you. My friend Shawn sent me this video last week and I have saved it for a post since. The speech is about 15 minutes long and I thought it was good enough to share on the site.
  

  
In the following video General Peter van Uhm, Chief of the Netherlands Defense Staff, eloquently explains why he chose the gun, instead of the pen or the brush, to make the world a better place.
  

  
Keep in mind that his son, First Lieutenant Dennis van Uhm, was killed in a roadside bombing in Uruzgan, the southern province of Afghanistan. Some have tried to turn this into a supporting argument for the right to bear arms, but I prefer the General&#8217;s direct message.
