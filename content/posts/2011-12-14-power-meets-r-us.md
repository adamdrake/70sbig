Chris and Mike did a meet this past weekend and Rory did one about a month ago. We&#8217;ll go in chronological order.
  

  
<a href="/blog/2011/10/another-awesome-day/#more-5536" target="_blank">Rory</a> had a goal of breaking the collegiate American squat record in the 198 lb class. Jacob went to the meet to <del datetime="2011-12-14T16:34:02+00:00">touch himself</del> watch, but Rory&#8217;s coach/handler didn&#8217;t show up! The fuck? After pulling his beard in rage, Jacob stepped in and did a swell job handling Rory in his record setting quest.
  

  
Rory primarily used a Smolov squat cycle to get his squat up and pretty much neglected the other lifts. It worked well for him as he broke the record with a 230k (507 lbs) squat on his second attempt, and then got some cues from Jacob to come back and increase his record to 235k (518 lbs):

Chris and Mike didn&#8217;t really taper for the meet and used it as a training day. Both had solid days. They ate at a shitty restaurant for breakfast and apparently it wreaked havoc on their stomachs. Chris cites this diarrhea as the primary reason his squats didn&#8217;t go as well. He went 622 and 639 on his first and second attempts, then on the third attempt at 650 he farted at the bottom and missed the rep. I&#8217;ll also address a small squatting issue in the programming and he&#8217;ll definitely hit 660 at the Arnold.
  

  
Chris then worked up to a simple 380 on his third attempt bench after not really pausing in training (although he recently doubled 385). On deadlift we did the normal &#8220;first attempt is last warm-up&#8221; around 585, then an intermediate jump around 622, then he took 307.5k (677) on his third for a routine pull. Chris went 8/9 with two meet PRs and he&#8217;s geared to have a great meet at the Arnold.

Mike continued his streak of very successful meets going 9/9 and hitting PR&#8217;s of 573 on squat, 325 on bench, and 628 on deadlift. Just fucking outstanding. I&#8217;ve said this before, but Mike is very in tune with his training. He usually knows exactly what he&#8217;s capable of in a meet based on how his training has been going. Lately he has been utilizing ladders on his bench volume and high bar and front squats on his squat volume with a lot of success (they will be discussed in detail in the new e-book).

Great job all around for everyone. Briskin also did a meet and PR&#8217;d on everything, although he&#8217;s unhappy with his progress. Go to the Facebook Fan Page for some more pictures and shenanigans from Rory/Mike/Chris&#8217; meets.
