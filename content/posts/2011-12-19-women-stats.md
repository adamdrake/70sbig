I&#8217;m interested in looking at information from female lifters. I&#8217;ve been observing the difference between the Volume and Intensity Days in the Texas Method for a while. Recently I started thinking in terms of percent instead of absolute weight; reducing the Volume Day weight to a certain percent of the Intensity Day weight is more instructive than aiming for a discrepancy between the weight lifted.

This led me to start thinking about the differences between female and male lifters. The neuromuscular efficiency of a female lifter is lower than a male&#8217;s. In other words, her nervous system cannot utilize motor units as well as a males. The neuron will innervate fewer muscle fibers compared to a male; it&#8217;s a result of different sex hormones and characteristics. This means that a female is not capable of lifting her true absolute strength &#8212; what her muscle fibers are actually capable of &#8212; because it&#8217;s always limited by the nervous systems ability to innervate muscle fibers (AKA neuromuscular efficiency).
  

  
This means that a girl&#8217;s 1RM is relatively lower and as a result she can perform multi-rep sets at a higher percentage of her actual max than a guy. If I can press 240, then I might be able to double 228, or 95% of my max. A girl might be able to do as many as five reps with 95% of her max.
  

  
To get more data points, I&#8217;d like the females to answer a few questions. Please forward these questions to any friends you have that lift (even periodically in CrossFit).
  

  
**1. List the 3 rep maxes (3RMs) of all the lifts you have data on. For example, if you don&#8217;t have data for bench, then omit it. If the weight is merely your best triple and not a true 3RM, please indicate this*.
  

  
2. List the 5RMs of all the lifts you have data on. If the weight is merely your best set of five and not a true 5RM, please indicate this*.
  

  
3. List the 1RMs of all the lifts you have data on. These 1RMs should be within three months of the above numbers.
  

  
4. List the set/rep scheme of your recent and/or current program. If you primarily perform fives or triples, point that out. If a girl has only done fives, then her lack of adaptation to singles would explain an artificially low 1RM.
  

  
*If you are able to perform this set more than once in the same training session, it is by default not a repetition max since repeating it means it wasn&#8217;t a representation of maximal ability.
  
Note: If you don&#8217;t have exact 3RMs or 5RMs (i.e. your best squat is 180&#215;4), then list the closest number.**
