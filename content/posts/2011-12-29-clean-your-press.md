About a year ago I started cleaning all of my press sets, and I prefer it. There&#8217;s a lot of utility in doing it, but it&#8217;s just cool. Here&#8217;s an example:

Weightlifters in the press era (before &#8217;72) always cleaned their presses because it was a contested lift. In the early days, there weren&#8217;t even racks, so cleaning the weight was the only way to get it on the shoulders for overhead movements. Whenever Bill Starr writes about pressing, he encourages lifters to clean it and even said that it&#8217;s possible to lift more weight that way. Bah, how could that make any sense?
  

  
**Lift More Weight**
  
Yet, the first time I cleaned and then pressed the weight, I completed a weight that was typically difficult out of the rack easier. I believe this was because my grip widened slightly (I have broad shoulders) and perhaps I was using a more narrow grip. However, other lifters have echoed similar experiences in lifting more after cleaning the weight. Some possible explanations include better wrist position after doing a clean compared to a normal un-racking, better intra-thoracic/abdominal pressure post-clean, or better thoracic extension post-clean. It also could be a combination of all three reasons, plus some other factors that are specific to an individual.
  

  
**Practice The Clean**
  
Since you&#8217;ll be cleaning every set of press or push-press, you&#8217;ll significantly enhance the number of cleans you perform IRREGARDLESS of program. This may not be relevant for a stress application &#8212; for example, my best press of 240 is at most 68% of my max clean &#8212; yet it can solidify starting position and teach attention to detail regarding &#8220;finishing the pull&#8221;. It can be used as speed practice; really focus on a fast jump in the power clean. It can also be practice for &#8220;getting under the bar&#8221; in a full clean. Since it&#8217;s probably a lower percentage of your max, it won&#8217;t significantly inhibit the press itself or the rest of the training session. Whether you want to power it for general strength work or do a full clean for Oly practice, you&#8217;ll get more repetitions which will only improve your skill. Uh, assuming you don&#8217;t suck really bad or something.

**Get Effective Clean Work In**
  
If the power clean or clean is a higher percentage of your max, then you train two movements at the same time. For example, in this 300 pound push-press, I power clean the weight:

That might be at most 92% of my max power clean (I don&#8217;t drop closer to parallel for power cleans). Yet it&#8217;s a high enough percentage where I&#8217;m receiving some stress from the power clean itself in addition to the stress applied from doing the push-presses. Assuming your technique is decent, you can kill two birds with one stone by training the power clean or clean as well as the overhead movement. This can help the lifters who need to be efficient with their time usage.
  

  
**It&#8217;s Cool**
  
Taking a weight off the floor, putting it on your shoulders, and then putting it overhead has been done as a test of strength for thousands of years. The bench press became more popular in the last fifty years because it&#8217;s used in football training and testing, but lying on your back is a poor excuse for strength compared to muscling something overhead. Being the only guy in an average gym that can put two or three hundred pounds over his head easily makes you instantly more badass than Johnny Flex mirin&#8217; his bis, tris, kis, dis, and tis in the corner. If I see someone put a decent weight overhead out of the rack, I&#8217;ll think, &#8220;Well, he didn&#8217;t clean it.&#8221; To me, it&#8217;s like not walking a squat out; cleaning the weight is old school and badass.
  

  
**It&#8217;s Functional**
  
The CrossFit crowd often needs to validate what they do by a movement&#8217;s utility. I can&#8217;t think of anything more relevant than picking something up and moving it around. Besides, the clean and press falls into the &#8220;<a href="/blog/2010/12/how-to-press-your-girlfriend/" target="_blank">pressing your girlfriend</a>&#8221; realm. If you can&#8217;t do that, then you&#8217;re not functional.
  

  
**It Will Help You Not Be Fat**
  
If you&#8217;re a fat person who doesn&#8217;t want to be a fat person, then doing more &#8220;full body&#8221; lifts will help. Training a lot of musculature has a greater systemic effect. In order to recover and adapt from systemic stresses, more calories are needed. Also, the hormonal response is different in that it promotes muscular growth and fat loss (when combined with an appropriate diet). Even if you&#8217;re still squatting in the workout, by doing some power cleans with your press, you&#8217;ll train more muscles to have a larger systemic stress to help you lose fat compared to the same workout without the clean.
  

  
**You&#8217;ll Get Stronger and Bigger**
  
Lastly, by doing the clean with your press or push-press, you&#8217;ll get stronger. You&#8217;ll be regularly training more musculature that includes the quads, hamstrings, glutes, lower back, upper back, and traps. You&#8217;ll solidify your pulling technique as well as add ancillary work. You&#8217;ll get adapted to a greater work load by doing more full body lifts in the week. It will make you a better person. It will make you rich. Everyone will love you. It&#8217;ll rain tits on you. You&#8217;ll walk on the moon without a space suit and be okay.
  

  
Start cleaning your presses and push-presses. It&#8217;ll make you a better human.
