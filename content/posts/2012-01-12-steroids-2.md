Readers occasionally ask me what the 70&#8217;s Big&#8217;s &#8220;official stance&#8221; on steroids is. That boils down to what my stance is, albeit with the opinion of some friends. We have talked about steroids on this website in the past (the first two links were posted by me, the last two posted by Gant):

For the sake of discussion, when I say &#8220;steroids&#8221; in this post, I&#8217;m referring to steroids and anabolic type compounds &#8212; the whole gamut of stuff that enhance performance via hormonal manipulation.
  

  
When I was younger, I was staunchly against steroids. Nowadays, I don&#8217;t really give a shit. If someone wants to use them, then it doesn&#8217;t bother me. And for the record, I think that it&#8217;s their right to decide if they want to or not. I haven&#8217;t ever used steroids, do not currently, and won&#8217;t in the future any time soon. I don&#8217;t have a problem with guys around the age of 35 to 40 and up supplementing a little bit of testosterone to stave off negative health effects (though I currently don&#8217;t have research to link to support this idea). Technically, I don&#8217;t have a problem with anyone currently using steroids. But when someone asks me, &#8220;Should I use steroids?&#8221; my answer is always the same:
  

  
1. Do you do everything in the realm of training consistently including, but not limited to, eating right, regularly training, mobbing, sleeping right, etc.?
  
If not, then it&#8217;s clear there are things to address that could improve your goals, whatever those goals are.
  
2. If you make the decision to use steroids, then do so with an informed opinion. Learn as much as you can from people who do it right. Don&#8217;t learn from some dickhead at the local Gold&#8217;s. Don&#8217;t learn from some guy on the internet who has gotten results from them. Learn from someone who has done it properly and has learned from or actually is a knowledgeable person that you can actually trust. This person should be able to explain the &#8216;why&#8217;, &#8216;how&#8217;, and &#8216;what&#8217; about steroids. Changing the hormones in your body is serious business, and I wouldn&#8217;t want you to have something bad occur because of negligence or ignorance.
  

  
Personally, I know very little about steroids. In every book I write, I clarify that I don&#8217;t have experience in coaching anybody that uses them, and I&#8217;ve already pointed out how I don&#8217;t have any experience taking them (though I&#8217;ve been accused of it at various points in the last 8 years). I also never knew a simple, direct source to learn about steroids basics. Every resource either seems to be chemistry related that is a bit over my &#8220;steroid knowledge&#8221; head, or it&#8217;s forum-type information saying &#8220;use this and this, it&#8217;ll work like a charm&#8221;. However, now there is such a source of information in the _<a href="http://strengthvillain.myshopify.com/collections/ebooks" target="_blank">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Steroids</a>_ by Brent Larson at <a href="http://strengthvillain.com" target="_blank">Strength Villain</a>.

I realize that some of you may be bothered by the steroids topic or a picture of needles, but it&#8217;s a topic that comes up a lot (even with people who don&#8217;t have any intentions of using). This book purposely reads as a conversation from the author to the reader about the very basics of steroids. The author, Brent Larson, is close with SV&#8217;s Johnny Pain and is also friends with steroid guru Anthony Roberts. First, I want to dispel any negative assumptions about this book. It&#8217;s not a meat head pro-steroid book. It does not include any information on how to illegally obtain steroids. It merely provides good basic information on what types of steroids a beginner needs to worry about and how to safely take and administer them. 

> I would like to remind the reader that this book is not intended to serve as an endorsement for steroid use, nor is it intended to deter the reader from experiencing the benefits of the drug. It is important to recognize the potential legal and health issues that may arise should you make an informed decision, as an adult, to partake in the use of anabolic steroids.

Overall, I found this book to be very informative. It doesn&#8217;t cloud the text with tons of chemistry and medical terms, but instead points out the positives and negatives about various types of steroids. It fairly discusses the implications for taking steroids, the side effects, how to train while using, how to administer the various drugs, and the limits of what should be taken within the first few cycles. It also discusses some strategies for how to take them beyond the beginning stages as well as various &#8220;stacks&#8221; (that term originated in steroid culture, if you didn&#8217;t know). **All in all, this book has much more content than the last couple SV books.** 

There&#8217;s even an appendix that includes various stories from first time steroid users &#8212; both good and bad &#8212; to help the reader make informed decisions. Despite not having any intentions in taking the drugs, even after reading this book, I found it to be very informative and useful; it clears up a lot of misconceptions that non-using steroid haters have.
  

  
Some concepts that I found particularly interesting were the concepts that steroids are not magic. 

> Steroids will enable to you to train harder and recover faster; use the drugs as a performance enhancement instead of a substitute for hard work, and you will never be disappointed.

Another concept is that steroids should account for a lack of attention to important aspects of training like diet. For example, I know people who have asked me if they should take steroids and they eat like shit. 

> There is no drug on the planet that will go to the gym for you or serve as a
  
> substitute for the quality nutrition that you need to feed your body.
> 
> :::
  
> If you are serious enough about your performance to take steroids, there is no reason why you should not have gotten your diet in order long ago.

Personally, I believe that if someone is going to have an opinion on steroids, whether for or against them, they should have a good understanding of what they are and what they do. The ethical and moral discussion are, in fact, relevant, yet steroids can be taken in a way that is not dangerous. Whether or not you support steroids, I think this e-book is very informative and will help uneducated (with respect to steroids) like me understand them better. If you have been mildly interested in using them, then this book will help you make the decision to do so or not (for me, it showed how much of a pain in the ass it is to use them). If you have made the decision to actually use them, then this book will give you good information to prevent you from fucking up your first cycle (whether through poor administration or training).
  

  
**REMEMBER:** I&#8217;m not endorsing the use of steroids, but I think a knowledge of them is useful and important in today&#8217;s training society. My primary points is IF you intend to use them, then you should learn and understand everything you can. This _Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Steroids_ is a place to start.
