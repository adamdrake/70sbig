Check out <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/" target="_blank">this really cool article</a> called &#8220;Instinctive sleeping and resting postures: an anthropological and zoological approach to treatment of low back and joint pain&#8221;. Be sure to read the actual article in addition to looking at the <del datetime="2012-02-15T05:44:33+00:00">awkward</del> pictures. It&#8217;s fascinating.
  

  
After yesterday&#8217;s post highlighting the benefits of a quality diet, and today&#8217;s post focused on how resting postures can improve or prevent joint problems, some readers are thinking, &#8220;What the hell? Is he gonna live in a cave next?&#8221; Well, if I had a choice, <a href="http://www.northernutahhomesearch.com/fine/real/estate/home_view/1064296/mlsname/WFRMLS" target="_blank">I&#8217;d live in this quaint cabin</a>. Here&#8217;s the deal: I&#8217;m obsessed with efficiency. When I was in school, I wanted to learn about the human body so I could improve it. When I started coaching, I wanted to learn how to best move the body with respect to mechanics and anatomy. When I started learning about training, I wanted to know how to optimally train the body. I constantly aim to have optimal technique in any athletic movement whether it&#8217;s lifting, shooting a gun, swimming, running, or agilely moving when playing pick-up volleyball. When I am cleaning up around the house, I think of the most efficient method to do each chore so that I don&#8217;t waste movement or time walking back and forth. So when there is clearly a dietary method that can improve the efficiency of the human body AND it can be tweaked to use for lifters, then I&#8217;m going to use it. It results in recovering more efficiently, but it also results in increasing the potential for long-term health. Like Rob Lowe, I want to live until I&#8217;m 150.
  

  
So when I see a physiotherapist who has spent many years around tribal and zoological populations, and he observes constants in how they rest, I consider that information relevant. I don&#8217;t take it for granted when the physiotherapist says that tribal populations simply don&#8217;t have many musculoskeletal problems. I deem that highly relevant. In the same way that a series of adaptations resulted in the evolution of various species, they have adapted to using particular methods of rest that prevent getting gunked up hips, knees, backs, and shoulders. I&#8217;m an anatomy and physiology nerd because it helps you and me get better.
  

  
Think about it: were our &#8220;ancestors&#8221; sitting hunched over in chairs on a regular basis? Even if we disregard the &#8220;this is how we evolved argument&#8221; (which is entirely valid and relevant), we can still observe the lack of joint issues in &#8220;tribal populations&#8221;. For example, what we call the &#8220;paleo squat&#8221; is observed by Tetley in this article and &#8220;can be very helpful in treating backs&#8221;, particularly in opening up the sacro-iliac joint and lumbar region.
