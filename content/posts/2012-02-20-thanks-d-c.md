If nothing else, say 70&#8217;s Big is thankful.
  

  
I wanted to have a formal thank you to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/crossfitannandale/5979958708/" target="_blank">Jeremy</a>, Phuong, and Courtney of <a href="http://www.crossfitannandale.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Anandale</a> for, in no particular order, helping to set up and host the workshop, showing me around D.C., entertaining me with food, drink, and good company, and allowing everyone (including the attendees) to have a great time. They are now some of my favorite people, worthy of drinking with at the mead halls in Tamriel.
  

  
Thanks to the attendees for being a good crew and asking great questions. It was a pleasure and I hope you all have fun.

Thanks to Rudy and Laura from <a href="http://outlawcrossfit.com/" target="_blank">Outlaw CrossFit</a> for letting me train at their gym. We also had a compelling interview that can be seen <a href="http://outlawcoach.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/120218/" target="_blank">HERE</a> on Rudy&#8217;s blog. It also includes me doing a weak-ass clean and jerk, the heaviest since &#8220;the Movember incident&#8221;. Also, check out Rudy&#8217;s programming; he makes some strong mother truckers over there.
