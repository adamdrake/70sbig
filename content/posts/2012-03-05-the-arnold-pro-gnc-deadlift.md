The Pro GNC Deadlift Competition is an invitation only event where the only contested lift is the deadlift. 15 men are selected along with 8 women. There are two scoring categories: 1) absolute weight and 2) Wilks formula. The criteria for selecting participants are:
  


 Men&#8217;s Competitor Criteria: Minimum 320kg Deadlift and Minimum 200 Wilks Score
  
 Women&#8217;s Competitor Criteria: Minimum 200 Wilks Score
  

  
The event occurred on the main stage inside the expo and was fantastic. The seating was good yet there was plenty of standing room. The music was loud, the announcers were solid (they were the same guys at the NAPF Raw Challenge that our guys lifted in), and the energy was high. Here are some notable lifts (I wasn&#8217;t able to record everything).
  

  
Kimberly Walford pulled 512 weighing 136 pounds! (not my video)

And Gillingham&#8217;s third attempt at 837. He&#8217;s 45 years old! Seeing him lifting in person was an experience.

Other notables include Carl Yngvar Christensen (pulled 832 on third, Gillingham went up 2.5kg to beat him) and Alyssa Hitchcock (who is attractive, <a href="http://youtu.be/n7na2OVtGEs" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a vid from 2011</a>). Everyone was notable in this competition; they wouldn&#8217;t be in it if they weren&#8217;t.
