Mike&#8217;s goals for this meet were to go 9/9 and total at least 1550 (if all the lifts were good, he would have had 1552). But the theme of the day was &#8220;trouble&#8221; for Mike.

During the squat warm-ups, I noticed that Mike&#8217;s knees were sorta forward at the bottom of the squat. Lately he&#8217;s been using high bar and front squats on his volume day, and it seemed that he developed a bit of &#8220;forwardness&#8221; in his squat. I brought this up to him, but we decided not to try and cue it all that much. Instead, I was more concerned with cuing &#8220;speed&#8221; on the descent. At 2011 USAPL Raw Nationals, I thought Mike&#8217;s lack of speed on the descent limited him in his bounce, and it also facilitated the judges in red-lighting his third attempt in that meet. My emphasis on a fast descent would ensure he gets the full stretch-reflex out of his hamstrings and probably help him achieve some depth. He looked better during the final few warm-ups. Note that it&#8217;s possible he sits back better with heavier weight (anything over, say, 475); some lifters will look different with light stuff than heavy stuff.

    Mike's third attempt squat -- it was red lighted on depth

I can&#8217;t remember his opening squat well (since we don&#8217;t have video on it), but I remember that it wasn&#8217;t as fast as I would have liked &#8212; both on the descent and ascent. Our original plan was to go from 240/529 to 255/562, but he was slow, so I called for 252.5/555. He was red lighted on that attempt. Mike wanted 581, but I called for 260/573 and cued speed on the descent and to get deeper. He was deeper &#8212; deep as he could possibly go on that day &#8212; was red lighted again. Here is the official IPF/USAPL ruling: 

> Upon receiving the Chief Refereeâ€™s signal the lifter must bend the knees and lower the body until the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of the knees. 

This essentially means that the &#8220;crease of the hip&#8221; is lower than &#8220;the top-most visible portion of the knee&#8221;. Very fair. Standing at a 45 degree angle from behind, I could see how it would be difficult to clear Mike on the second attempt. However, I thought he was good on the third attempt, though I remember thinking it was still close. In retrospect, I should have focused more on depth after the red-lighted second attempt. I should have cued &#8220;knees out&#8221; and &#8220;depth&#8221; instead of still focusing on speed with depth. I felt that if he went down fast that he&#8217;d actually hit depth and catch a bounce for a pretty easy squat, but he has learned to be a bit slow on the descent. But, Mike and I both agree that he physically could not have gotten any deeper on that rep.
  

  
Mike was pretty pissed off over missing two squats, and comically threatened to quit powerlifting and become a janitor. He was legitimately irritated, but we got focused back in to hit our bench numbers. One thing at a time in powerlifting.
  

  
Mike opened with a simple 140/308 opener, which is nice considering that his first meet in 2010 he only benched 281. We took 147.5/325, and then called for a solid 155/341 on the third attempt. It was a good call, because I think he would only have been able to hit 2.5kg above that (and it would have been a limit rep). Mike has made a good, consistent progress on bench and has even developed a good method of using ladder benches for the volume day (to be discussed in the new e-book).
  
   

  
At the start of deadlift, Mike&#8217;s goal was to stay ahead of Randy Cairns, a 47 year old lifter in the 120+ weight class. We didn&#8217;t realize it at first, but this became a battle for third place in the super heavy class. We took the standard easy opener on the platform at 250/550. Then we took 272.5/600 as the intermediary jump, but the lockout was, to me, uncomfortably slow. It wasn&#8217;t necessarily hard, but I would have loved to see Mike rip the shit out of that attempt. Meanwhile Cairns had hit that weight on his second attempt right before Mike. We called for 287.5/633, which made Cairns opt for 277.5/611 to stay ahead of Mike (assuming Mike hit the 287.5kg), but he missed it on his third attempt (hard to make multiple near maximal deadlifts). So we made a weight change to 290/639, a lift that would tie Mike and Randy with Mike winning with a lighter body weight.
  

  
I knew the lockout would be rough, so I cued a smooth lockout. The bar left the ground fast, passed the knees fast, and then slowed down so much as it neared lockout. Mike was literally only several inches from lockout when his knees shifted forward slightly, relieving tension and stalling the rep. Check the video. I&#8217;m upset that I didn&#8217;t cue a &#8220;fast lockout&#8221; since that could have helped, but from now on I will cue Mike to get his &#8220;hips through&#8221;. Had he pushed them through, possibly thinking about flexing the glutes, then he may have been able to struggle through that lockout. Randy ended up winning third place in the 120+, a position that Mike would have solidified with white lighted squats or a good third attempt deadlift. Congrats to Randy. It&#8217;s also interesting that Mike thought he would only place as high as fifth in either the 120 or 120+ class, and he ended up with a shot at a bronze medal in the 120+. You never know what can happen.
  

  
Mike finished with:
  
Squat &#8211; 240/529
  
Bench &#8211; 155/341
  
Deadlift &#8211; 272.5/600
  
Total 667.5/1470 (goal was 1550, will hit it at Nationals)
  

  
Mike has a few things to work on. The first item relates to the squat depth issue. I think we can move his stance in a little bit. If the stance is too wide, then it&#8217;s harder to get externally rotated at the hip (via shoving the knees out). External hip rotation prevents any impingement with the upper femur and the ASIS (hip bone), including the mass between those bones. More external rotation would allow for more hip flexion while maintaining good posture in the lower back. However, this is dependent on the mobility to actually shove the hips out. I think we can improve Mike&#8217;s mobility with specific lacrosse ball work on the external rotators (while in hip flexion) as well as opening up the anterior hip. Lastly, he can improve his ankle flexibility to allow a) a more acute dorsiflexion that will facilitate a deeper squat and b) the shin to have a better lateral angle coming off of the ankle joint whilst his hips aim to externally rotate. I&#8217;d also like him to start working on the speed of his heavier squats, but that might open up as a result of improved mobility.
  

  
As for his bench, we&#8217;ll keep working on it and improving it gradually. Mike bought a slingshot at the expo, so I think it will be a tool that will help his bench training. We&#8217;ll be learning about ways to program it within the context of our template and programming strategy. As for his deadlift, I think he should have an emphasis on rack pulls between now and nationals. He&#8217;s never really had an issue with getting the bar off the floor, but his long femurs create a disgustingly horrendous lever arm during lockouts. Rack pulls will allow him to handle heavy lockouts which will prevent what happened on his last deadlift. He&#8217;ll be back with a vengeance at nationals, I assure you. And probably in the 120 class.
