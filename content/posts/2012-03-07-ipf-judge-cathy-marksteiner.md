I&#8217;ve seen Cathy Marksteiner at some meets in the past, and she&#8217;s always been really amusing to interact with. This past weekend she was working the table and ultimately coddled me when I kept screwing things up. I&#8217;m only half joking, but she and some other IPF officials made the meet fun for a coach.
  

  
I was unaware that she was <a href="http://www.usapowerlifting.com/halloffame/women/cathy_marksteiner/index.shtml" target="_blank">inducted into the USAPL Hall of Fame</a>. She&#8217;s been in the sport of powerlifting for over 30 years. That article quoted her as saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s all about friendships and relationships across the US and World!&#8221; That&#8217;s obviously true given that she hit a front double biceps pose with me on the stage (pictured above). Below is a video of her competing at the 2009 IPF Master&#8217;s World Championships. If you ever see Cathy at a meet, strike up a conversation because she&#8217;s easy to get along with. There are good people in powerlifting.
