I know you guys really wanted me to harass people, but most of everyone I met was really nice (even the fitness models &#8211;> more on that in another post). This was some giant eastern European or Russian guy who was competing in the amateur strongman competition on Friday morning. I can&#8217;t remember his name and can&#8217;t hear it well in the video, but he was a big dude.

_Edit:_ Paul Sousa posted the <a href="http://americanstrongman.com/2012/03/Arnold2012-Sheet1.pdf" target="_blank">results of the amateur strongman</a> and thinks that Dimitar Savatinov is in the video.
