I first saw Preston at the 2010 Texas State and he&#8217;s&#8230;grown a bit. Now he&#8217;s 19 years old and kicking ass in USA Powerlifting. He&#8217;s a 120kg/264 lb lifter who competes in single-ply gear and has recently squatted 821 and deadlifted 650 at Junior Worlds. His raw bench is about 550. He ended up benching 300kg/661 at the bench only meet on Sunday and missed a second attempt 312.5/688.94.
  

  
Preston is friggin&#8217; stout, and he&#8217;s a really nice guy. Again, there are a lot of good people in powerlifting. Keep training hard, Preston, and good luck.
