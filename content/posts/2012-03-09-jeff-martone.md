I&#8217;ve known of Jeff Martone (owner of <a href="http://tacticalathlete.com/index.php" target="_blank">Tactical Athlete</a>) since I got into CrossFit in early 2008, but I had never met him. After Shankle lifted in the 105 session on Saturday morning, Martone was sitting at his booth by himself and Jeremy and I decided to try the 90 pound pull-up (for a free t-shirt). I, of course, missed it:

Then I asked Jeff he was going to do any kettlebell juggling, but he only had 90 pound kettlebells (a bit heavy for KB juggling). Then I asked if he was going to do any Turkish Get-ups, and he said he needed a female that weighed 135 or less.
  
Mission: Find female who was 135 or less.
  

  
I went up to an over-cooked-tan blonde girl, and said, &#8220;Hi. I realize this isn&#8217;t a question a guy would typically ask a girl, but how much do you weigh?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t get slapped because I&#8217;m a little more suave than that, but she was 155. Then I saw a little gal walking with her husband. I politely asked the husband, and after hearing the question he chuckled and said, &#8220;Ask her,&#8221; while pointing to his wife. Well, we already know that that MISSION WAS ACCOMPLISHED, and here&#8217;s the vid (she weighed 110 pounds):
