Sorry folks, there&#8217;s not Q&A. I&#8217;ll also save my reading list for next week. There are still more posts that will be trickling out today from the Arnold including an interview with the young Preston Turner, the Arnold Strongman Classic Finals, the bodybuilding finals, some clips of Arnold, clips of me dicking around with one of the booths, random expo footage, Jeff Martone, and Mark Bell (probably put Bell&#8217;s up next week).
  

  
This post is where you should tell us about your weekly training PR&#8217;s and training updates. You may have some overall training goals for 2012, but now reverse engineer that and tell us what your goals for March are.
  

  
Train hard. If you can&#8217;t, <a href="/blog/2012/03/crush-your-enemies/" target="_blank">read this</a>.
