If you&#8217;re wondering why there wasn&#8217;t a post yesterday, it&#8217;s because my ISP took a shit. Today, I had to use internet at a public location. I had a nice &#8220;Toe Angle when Squatting&#8221; post lined up, but the upload speed for the accompanying video is abysmal. Instead, here are some videos to wet your whistle.
  

  
**Ask questions for tomorrow&#8217;s Q&A in today&#8217;s comments.** I&#8217;ll gather up the good ones and use them tomorrow. Also, feel free to post interesting articles for me and other readers (if they are solid, I&#8217;ll add them to the weekly reading list).
  

  
Oh! I nearly forgot. Klokov was in my dream last night. We sat on a bench in Soviet Russia and had a conversation.. He was wearing a tank top. He talked about life and training. I came.

Here&#8217;s Norik Vardanian cleaning, then front squatting, then jerking 210kg (no big deal):

Here&#8217;s another of him hitting a <a href="http://youtu.be/zon7CBQY1Ck" target="_blank">really solid snatch at 170kg</a>. He also <a href="http://youtu.be/7e6Ld5YrCDk" target="_blank">CJ&#8217;d 215</a>. Norik used to lift for USA Weightlifting but <a href="http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/18425/Suspension_N_Vardanian_090929.pdf" target="_blank">tested positive for marijuana</a>. He now lifts for Armenia and is a 94kg lifter.
  

  
Here&#8217;s Konstantinovs doing his max effort squatting day:

His recent &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/sUEVZrYeWco" target="_blank">deadlift training day</a>&#8221; vid is even more impressive.
  

  
And lastly, here&#8217;s Hysen Pulaku CJing 200kg at a 77kg body weight. He&#8217;s an Albanian lifter who is rumored to get US citizenship&#8230;
