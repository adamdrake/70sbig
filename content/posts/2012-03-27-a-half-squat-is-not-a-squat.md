I was at the gym last night and a younger guy stepped into one of the squat racks. _This outta be good,_ I thought. If someone actually does squat in a fitness gym, it&#8217;s a half squat done with a back pad. To my pleasant surprise, this guy walked out 135 and squatted it to full depth; I&#8217;d rather see light weight squatted fully than heavy weight done partially. After a few minutes, I motioned for him to take out his headphones and said, &#8220;Hey man, I just want you to know I appreciate that you squat to full depth.&#8221; After a split second of confusion, I added, &#8220;Cause nobody ever does.&#8221; He nodded in recognition and I walked away. We never talked again.

I hate half squats&#8230;<a href="/blog/2010/10/squat-all-of-the-way-down/" target="_blank">so fucking much</a>. **Every time you donâ€™t squat to depth, I pour a beer down the drain. And I HATE wasting beer.** I just don&#8217;t understand why people think it&#8217;s okay to do partial reps of _anything_, much less in squatting. Muscular development or strength is achieved by working muscles through a full range of motion. Squatting, benching, or curling through half of the ROM only trains the musculature through that given ROM and typically subjects it to injurious forces. For example, a half squat will not utilize the adductors, hamstrings, gluteals, or external rotators and as a result place excessive stress on the anterior aspect of the knee. This is why ignorant people claim that squats are bad for the knees. And wWhy would someone want half a muscle?
  

  
Ego lifting is such a joke. Aside from the &#8220;let&#8217;s see how many plates I can put on the bar&#8221;, it isn&#8217;t quantifiable whatsoever. There&#8217;s no way to determine if one rep is comparable to another. It drives me insane and I can&#8217;t evedslkf;j;lasdkjfaskdlgkad;svn w089yt204389fvay xgch&#8217;jbk&#8217;fuck

Here&#8217;s a video of an easy full-depth squat (445&#215;3, BW 187ish) by Brooks Conway at <a href="http://quest-athletics.com" target="_blank">Quest Athletics</a>.

Never, ever half squat. If you do we should all just quit lifting and start drinking mermosas while getting pedicures and facials.
