Oi! 70&#8217;s Big is headed back to Austraya in April to hang out with top fuckin&#8217; blokes and conduct some workshops. The first big date is the 70&#8217;s Big Workshop Weekend on the weekend of April 14 and 15. This will consist of the Saturday Lifting Workshop (where participants receive coaching on lifting) and the Sunday Programming Workshop (where I lecture on various programming topics and teach you how to program). There will also be an opportunity to do some small group or one-on-one training. <a href="mailto:70sBigWorkshop@gmail.com" target="_blank">E-mail me here</a> to inquire.

That&#8217;s just the stuff that I&#8217;m allowed to show you. Oh, and this:
