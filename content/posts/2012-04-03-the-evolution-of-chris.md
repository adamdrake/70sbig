I moved to Wichita Falls in January of 2009 and didn&#8217;t know anybody at all. I became friends with Brent when he would come into the gym and train by himself. Shortly after, I met Chris. I&#8217;ll keep the sappy stuff to a minimum, but since then he&#8217;s been one of my best friends and is a hard working, hilarious, and caring friend who has always been there for me. You guys see his videos these days and see a guy who is stronger than cat piss, but it wasn&#8217;t always so. I want to show you how far he&#8217;s come so that you understand that you&#8217;re fully capable of it too.
  

  
Chris deadlifts 705 at the Raw Challenge at the Arnold:

In early January 2009, Chris wrecked his shoulder doing a jerk in a weightlifting meet (he probably required surgery). A few weeks later he knew he wasn&#8217;t going to be able to do the Oly lifts any time soon and wanted to get as strong as possible. This is where our &#8220;training relationship&#8221; started; we became training partners and I started programming his training. If you&#8217;ve never had a true training partner, you&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s an intimate relationship where you feed off of their energy when lifting. To this day, I still get exponentially more amped up when Chris is lifting than I ever have for my own lifting.

At this point, Chris was squatting in the mid to high 300s for reps and was deadlifting in the low 400s for a set of five. He did not lift in high school but had been at it a couple of years. His favorite lift was and is the deadlift. We were on a linear progression together, though we couldn&#8217;t always train during the week together (I was always present during his session since I was always at the gym). Early on, I asked Chris what his goals were, and without hesitation he said, &#8220;I want to deadlift 600 for 5.&#8221; When he said that in March 2009, I looked at him, thought about where he was at (about 425&#215;5 or so), and I said, &#8220;That would be sweet.&#8221; It was a lofty goal, but I thought one day he could do it, though it would take some time.
  

  
Every time Chris deadlifted, he would wear this old, hole-ridden Arkansas football shirt. He happened to wear it on every deadlift session to the point where I started joking around and saying, &#8220;Hey man, is that your deadlift shirt?&#8221; He laughed and was like, &#8220;Yeah man, I&#8217;m gonna wear it when I do 600 for 5.&#8221; And so that became his thing. He would wear this ratty-ass shirt with holes in it when deadlifting, and we made jokes that it would explode off of him as he pulled the fifth rep at 600.
  

  
Let&#8217;s begin our timeline.
  

  
July of 2009 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/_whTgZnwXW0" target="_blank">Chris deadlifts 515&#215;5</a>. This set a milestone as the heaviest weight he had ever deadlifted period, and the heaviest he had done for a set of five. Something about this video makes me laugh. Maybe it&#8217;s cause Chris looks like a kid, or maybe it&#8217;s because when he deadlifts this weight nowadays, he rips it off the floor so fast the bar flings back and forth at the top. I dunno.
  
Note that there was a two month period where Chris couldn&#8217;t squat because of a groin strain (it was somewhere in the April/May/June time frame)
  

  
September of 2009 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/g9lj-DI7IEE" target="_blank">Chris deadlifts 600 for the first time</a>, then hitched 625. We worked his &#8220;one set of five&#8221; deadlift progression up to 545, and it was close to a limit set. I hadn&#8217;t decided what I wanted him to do on the next deadlift day, so when he walked in (with that smelly, ratty Arkansas shirt), I said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do 600 today.&#8221; His eyes got all wide; 600 was a barrier, a giant milestone for Chris. He got pretty nervous, and he had to wait until after squatting and pressing to do it.
  

  
November of 2009 &#8212; Chris and I are now on the Texas Method. I&#8217;ve since started competing in Olympic weightlifting and he&#8217;s continuing to get stronger. I embedded this video because I want you to see him squat 500&#215;3. The set isn&#8217;t very hard, but it isn&#8217;t easy. He also misses a fifth rep on a 215 press and does some haltings (which I do not recommend).

April of 2010 &#8212; 2010 Texas State Meet (all meets are USAPL, I&#8217;m handling him at the meet unless otherwise noted, and Chris competes raw and un-drugged). Chris squats 600 for the first time and deadlifts 633 (no video).
  

  
May of 2010 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/FPT6tNVrhZk" target="_blank">Chris pulls a routine 600</a> without getting amped.
  

  
July of 2010 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/KKyt5SFKA6s" target="_blank">First national raw meet</a>. He misses a third squat at 606, misses his second bench of 368 due to the lower back cramping (I waved the third), and <a href="http://youtu.be/KKyt5SFKA6s?t=2m57s" target="_blank">misses a heartbreaking 650 deadlift on the third attempt</a>.
  

  
September of 2010 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/aVIz4yX-EnU" target="_blank">Chris deadlifts 600&#215;3</a> in training.
  

  
October of 2010 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/A6xs-XnrxVY" target="_blank">Chris squats 585&#215;2 in training</a>.
  

  
November of 2010 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/-pZB8b9mfvo" target="_blank">Chris squats 600&#215;2</a> in training (still using Texas Method, modifying it and tweaking it as we go and developing it into what the second e-book consists of).
  

  
April of 2011 &#8212; Fast forward to the <a href="http://youtu.be/7GHDyhk2rOQ" target="_blank">2011 Texas State meet</a> (I wasn&#8217;t there). Chris squats 644 on his third attempt, misses a third bench at 385 (363 on second), and deadlifts 661. <a href="http://youtu.be/7GHDyhk2rOQ?t=2m19s" target="_blank">He&#8217;s also a good dancer</a>.
  

  
August of 2011 &#8212; 2011 Raw Nationals (no video). Chris squatted 622 on his second (missed the third), made a 374 bench on his second (missed third), and devilishly deadlifted 666 on his third.
  

  
November of 2011 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/rDoMsDj2duk" target="_blank">Chris deadlifts 625&#215;3</a>.
  

  
December of 2011 &#8212; Holiday Classic in Arlington. Chris misses third squat, but got 639 on second, benches 380, and <a href="http://youtu.be/aygYX2MA4yM?t=57s" target="_blank">deadlifts a solid 677</a> (I wasn&#8217;t at this meet, Mike/Chris used it as a training day). Later in the month he <a href="http://youtu.be/vBrrKQTEKis?t=33s" target="_blank">rack pulled 650&#215;3</a>.
  

  
January of 2012 &#8212; I realize my programming fault on his squat, modify things, and <a href="http://youtu.be/CnWhlww29kI" target="_blank">Chris squats 610&#215;2, 620&#215;2, and 630&#215;2</a>. He also rack pulled 675&#215;3 and <a href="http://youtu.be/evHE2N2Qh5M" target="_blank">then 700&#215;1</a>.
  

  
February of 2012 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/uRHA50pJcz8" target="_blank">Chris squats 640&#215;2 on his third double</a> (did 600/620&#215;2 as well).
  

  
March of 2012 &#8212; <a href="http://youtu.be/P4RAPRC4BKM" target="_blank">USAPL Raw Challenge at the Arnold Sport Festival</a>. <a href="http://youtu.be/P4RAPRC4BKM" target="_blank">Chris squats 661</a>, close grip benches 374 (shoulder hadn&#8217;t been enjoying the regular grip), and <a href="http://youtu.be/jXlgEPzEU8g" target="_blank">deadlifts 705</a>.
  

  
April of 2012 &#8212; Chris aims to deadlift 600 for max reps with the minimum goal of 5 reps. Three years ago while weighing about 245 and deadlifting in the mid 400s, Chris told me he wanted to deadlift 600 for 5. Let&#8217;s see what happens:

Edit: You can view <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/criley3434/videos" target="_blank">Chris</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ghoststoglory/videos" target="_blank">Mike</a>&#8216;s YouTube channels for additional training footage.
  

  
600 for 6. Three long years of ups and downs. The one constant thing in Chris&#8217; life is that he trained hard every. single. week. The only time I can remember him missing a session is when he was sick for several weeks before the Arnold this year. Training is a priority in Chris&#8217; life not because he thinks he has to do it, but because he loves it. I&#8217;m glad to have been a part of the journey in being his friend, training partner, and coach. Mike is also an integral part in Chris&#8217; training, coaching, and handling (at the smaller meets) and has the same mentality with his training.

If you&#8217;ve ever doubted yourself or thought a goal was too lofty, then look at where Chris started. You see him deadlift 705 and think it&#8217;s a lot, but he was just an average lifter three years ago. It&#8217;s absurd to claim that he&#8217;s genetically superior, because if he was, he would have been hitting this weight three years ago. He didn&#8217;t just all of a sudden squat 661 and deadlift 705, he had to earn it every step of the way. Remember that you may have come a long way, but you still have a journey ahead of you. What are you committing to today?
