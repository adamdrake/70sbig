I&#8217;ve had pain in to the left of my spine, a little inferior (below) the scapula and just lateral of the vertebrae, off and on over the last year. It&#8217;s often not debilitating, but it will get worse when I sit for long periods of time. I have strained several times where I couldn&#8217;t train for a few sessions. I did it in January when I was playing Skyrim, and another time it happened when I was front squatting in Texas (2010, I think). The earliest I ever strained it was before I even did CrossFit, so that must have been in 2007 (I was doing a dumbbell row). I have a slight curve to my thoracic spine which would probably explain why the erector spinae muscles on that side have issues. Most people have a small degree of scoliosis that is hardly noticeable without an x-ray.
  

  
I&#8217;ve tried a lot of different things from Mobility WOD, and they helped, but the pain still lingers. I used two parts from &#8220;5 way shoulder&#8221; (specifically a) flexion and external rotation to stretch the lats and b) the cross-chest stretch in external rotation that pulls the scapula away from the spine. They helped, and my thoracic flexibility improved (to the point that those stretches don&#8217;t accomplish as much anymore), but I still have the pain. I&#8217;ve noticed that sometimes I tend to slightly over extend at my thoracic/lumbar junction and my sacro/lumbar junction in an attempt to not slouch. This could be something that makes it worse. When I laterally flex to my right side, the left side feels stretched and alleviated. Also, if I push my left ribs to the right, and push my right hip to the left, I get an overt stretching sensation along the lower erector muscles.
  

  
All of the above is to give you an idea of the data I&#8217;ve collected on this injury and how it could help me work on it to improve it. Deep rooted types of pain or injuries will not respond as well to merely stretching them, and there aren&#8217;t really any joints to approximate in the spine (like you can do with the shoulder, elbow, hip and knee). This is a long term issue, so if I&#8217;m going to penetrate deeper into the tissue, I will need to use a lacrosse ball and at least my own body weight laying on top of it. I can increase the amount of weight by using a weight (plate, dumbbell, dog, etc.) on my chest. However, what I do while on that lacrosse ball is important.

Look at the three muscle groupings that make up the erector spinae. Some are right next to the spine while others fan out and attach on the ribs. By knowing what&#8217;s going on under the skin, I can better attack these muscles to alleviate their &#8220;deep rooted&#8221; problem. It may be that my anatomical assymetry (slightly curved thoracic spine) has helped them get tight, or it might be that they have gotten tight from how I sit at my computer and drive (likely). Someone might look at this and say I have a muscular imbalance. Yes, there&#8217;s an imbalance, but not necessarily due to a &#8220;weakness&#8221;. If there&#8217;s a weakness (and I don&#8217;t think there is), it&#8217;s due to the chronically tight position, not the other way around. Or, there might be some ROM limitations that result in a a weakness (the same way that if your biceps couldn&#8217;t move through the full ROM, it&#8217;d look or feel like a weakness).
  

  
Instead of just laying on a ball and just mashing stuff around, instead I should have a plan. How can I have an effect on these particular muscles to relieve tension, let them slide over one another, or function better? Let&#8217;s move along the muscle belly. I hadn&#8217;t really focused on moving along the muscle belly of these erectors until last night, and the effect was instantly noticeable. I tried tack and stretching medial to the scap as well as inferior to the scap, but it never really produced the effect. However, after looking at the muscle attachment sites and looking at a trigger point therapy book I have, I realized I hadn&#8217;t moved along the muscle belly. I worked from above the pain, towards it, on it, and then below it, and I freed up those tissues and had an instant relief of pain. Neato.
  

  
If you are a coach or if you lift alone, improving your anatomy knowledge is important in your ability to prevent and treat injuries or &#8220;issues&#8221;. Obviously I think anatomical knowledge is important for understanding the lifts themselves, but that&#8217;s pretty easy to grasp. To understand injuries and how to rehab and treat them, you need an understanding of the smaller details. Knowing &#8220;hamstring&#8221; and &#8220;quad&#8221; isn&#8217;t enough; you need to know where those muscles attach (like how the hamstrings wrap around the head of the tibia after crossing the knee).
  

  
My little epiphany also brings up the point that if you know the muscular anatomy, then you know how to work on it with a lacrosse ball. Instead of blindly smashing on tissues, work along their muscle bellies. There are instances when feathering over the muscle perpendicular to how the fibers run is necessary (like when working on the TFL after carrying a heavy pack on your back), yet there I bet most instances work better when you move parallel with the fibers &#8212; especially when there is a long muscle belly like in the erector spinae group. Think about other muscles that have long bellies: quadriceps, hamstrings, biceps, back muscles, and the forearms. If you have pain in a region, then see what happens if you move &#8220;upstream&#8221; and &#8220;downstream&#8221; of that pain with careful, controlled undulations on a lacrosse ball. But before you do, learn the anatomy of the structure so you know where to put that lacrosse ball.
  

  
My favorite musculoskeletal anatomy book is the &#8220;Trail Guide to the Body&#8221;, a book made for PTs and massage therapists. I had to get it in school, and it&#8217;s phenomenal. I&#8217;ve heard other people cite other anatomy books, but nothing has the detail, muscle action, origin/insertion, and how to palpate every structure like this book. There&#8217;s a 4th edition out, but you can find the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=trail+guide+to+the+body+3rd+edition" target="_blank">3rd edition</a> for pretty cheap (I just bought another copy for $15, which is an absolute steal).

I use this book every time someone asks me an injury question. The good thing is that every time I get a question, I review what I&#8217;ve learned in the past by studying the area again. It helps me learn how to rehab things (by getting the muscle to contract) as well as how to mob things (as I described above). Combine this book with &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Without-Scalpel-Dr-Kilgore/dp/0615390722" target="_blank">Anatomy Without A Scalpel</a>&#8221; and you&#8217;re set up to have a good understanding of musculoskeletal anatomy.
  

  
I&#8217;m surprised to learn how many coaches and lifters do not have a good understanding of anatomy. Make it a point to improve this understanding because it will heighten your understanding of lifting mechanics, but also help with injuries and mobility work.
