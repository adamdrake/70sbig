There are many people who write about weightlifting in the USA, but they don&#8217;t always agree with each other. There are intricacies in the set-up or pull that will set some coaches on opposing sides of the battlefield. Despite these differences, there are still aspects of programming and mechanics that should be universal. My pal Jacob Tsypkin, the hated YouTube sensation, does a nice job of summarizing these &#8220;truths&#8221; that should be accepted as self evident. Jacob has been learning and training under <a href="http://pendlayforum.com/" target="_blank">Glenn Pendlay</a> at <a href="http://www.californiastrength.com/" target="_blank">California Strength</a>; he will be a very good weightlifting coach in the future.
  

  
Below are five important concepts that, when followed, will yield appropriate training and execution. Read the full article on <a href="http://tsypkin.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/general-philosophy-for-development-of.html" target="_blank">Jacob&#8217;s blog/site</a>.

> #1: Position Is Everything
  
> 
  
> #2: Mechanics, Consistency, Intensity
  
> 
  
> #3: Regularly train at or near maximal weights
  
> 
  
> #4: Everything which is not a competition style snatch or C&J is an assistance exercise
  
> 
  
> #5: Never stop doing the full lifts. Ever. 

Note that these concepts are specific to an Olympic weightlifter; some may not apply to a general strength and power trainee. Do you think Jacob left any important concepts out? What else would you add?
