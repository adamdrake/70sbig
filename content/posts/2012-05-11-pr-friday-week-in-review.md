It&#8217;s been a hectic month, and things still aren&#8217;t normal. I&#8217;d like to formally thank Tom, Pete, Shannon, Shaun, and Shari for a lovely time in Australia. There are plenty of other assholes &#8212; like Stu, Josh, Sean, Jobbo, Kurt, Jeff, Steady, Sharpie, Gary, and plenty more that I&#8217;m forgetting &#8212; that made the trip heaps of fun. To all of you: stay in touch, train hard, eat well, and mob your genitals off.
  
_Edit: I also have some good footage of a koala flipping his shit (literally and figuratively)._ 
  

  
**PR Friday**
  
It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve had a formal day to post training updates and PRs, so make sure and do so. I&#8217;ll remind you that one of the coolest parts of this site is the interaction between the readers, and if you don&#8217;t actually post, you miss out on that indefinitely. I&#8217;d like you guys to point out any specific aspects of your programming that you think have helped out in the past several months. This could be a programming template, a mob, or an accessory movement.
  

  
**Pan American Championships**
  
The Pan Ams begin today and will mark the last chance any American men have at earning the single spot to the Olympics. Chad Vaughn has pulled out of this competition due to a groin injury &#8212; Chad had an excellent career and competed in the last two Olympic games and was a top 20 world competitor. Kendrick Farris is currently sitting in the driver&#8217;s seat for the single spot while Donny Shankle will try to hit massive numbers to earn the spot. More information on this throughout the day (after I train) as well as any streaming links. There may also be a live chat with the stream as well as current coverage of the competition. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> will provide the most updated coverage.
  

  
**Week In Review**
  
On Monday we talked about the &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/05/banded-good-morning/" target="_blank">banded good morning</a>&#8221; (with video) and how it has immense utility in working the posterior chain, rehab, and a finisher that can aid recovery. I highly recommend it&#8217;s inclusion in most programs. On Tuesday we talked about how <a href="/blog/2012/05/prilepins-chart/" target="_blank">Prilepin&#8217;s Chart</a> can a trainee&#8217;s programming template to ensure appropriate doses of stress. There will be a follow up on using different intensities in the same training session. On Wednesday we took a look at the <a href="/blog/2012/05/london-94kg-battle/" target="_blank">94kg class</a> in preparation for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. It seems that Ilya Ilin and Artem Ivanov are hitting great numbers in training, and it could lead to a toe-to-toe battle in London.
  

  
**Questions**
  
There won&#8217;t be a Q&A this week, but feel free to ask questions for next week&#8217;s Q&A in the comments. If it&#8217;s a simple question, some of the other readers may attempt at an answer, and I&#8217;ll take the best ones for next week&#8217;s column. I&#8217;ll also sift through some of the comments, e-mails, and messages I received while abroad and pick out the good ones.
