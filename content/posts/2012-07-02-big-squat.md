I&#8217;m travelling; lots o&#8217; driving. Interact with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. ooga booga.

Here&#8217;s a video of Beverly Crawford, a young powerlifter who will is preparing for the IPF sanctioned North American Powerlifting Championships (to put it in perspective, it&#8217;s the single ply version of what Chris/Mike/Alex did in the raw version at the Arnold Sport Festival). She&#8217;s squatting 365 for two singles and then 335&#215;2. Bev is coached by the unbearably handsome Brooks Conway at <a href="http://www.quest-athletics.com/" target="_blank">Quest Athletics</a>. The front angle may throw you off, but the Quest lifters are using the same mechanics as what we call &#8220;the low bar squat&#8221;, yet note the differences. The more narrow hand placement allows the lifter to lock down their trunk, particularly the lats, before descending. The upward eye gaze is pretty different, but it doesn&#8217;t inhibit the emphasis on hip drive. I&#8217;ll note that I coach a 45 degree downward angle at the lowest (as opposed to looking near the feet). Here&#8217;s another video of Bev smoking the SHIT out of a <a href="http://youtu.be/jC7BWcs1Hr8?t=30s" target="_blank">425 reverse band conventional deadlift</a> and then <a href="http://youtu.be/UYymkMQmWIE?t=47s" target="_blank">squatting 355&#215;3</a>.
