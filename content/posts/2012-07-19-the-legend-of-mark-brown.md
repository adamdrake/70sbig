There is not a man, but a legend. There&#8217;s a man whose name is whispered into the night by children in distant villages. There&#8217;s a man who some may call a conjurer &#8212; not of cheap tricks, but of demons. Others call &#8220;that crazy guy&#8221;. Still, yet, others simply call him Mark Brown.

Mark Brown is a good friend of mine that lives in Texas. He trains at least three times a week, every week.Â When people boast about not having a light day, that is just standard ops for the legendary Mark Brown. The reason I love Mark Brown so much is because he brings intensity EVER. SINGLE. DAY. His intensity shifts depending on what he&#8217;s training that day. When he snatches and cleans, he is a stolid, grim figure. He paces back and forth between lifts. In an instant he&#8217;ll snatch 100 kilos, then shake his shoulders out and walk away. Yet when he&#8217;s squatting or deadlifting, THE WORLD IS ON FIRE. The intensity is cranked up, because there&#8217;s an animal within Mark Brown, and he must &#8212; HE DESIRES &#8212; to unleash it on the bar.

Some of my most favorite training sessions of my life &#8212; and I&#8217;ve had many in the 13 years that I&#8217;ve trained &#8212; are with Mark Brown. We would yell and kick and antagonize each other. We would summon the demons. I still remember the exact phrases Mark Brown would say as I would go to hit a PR squat.

&#8220;C&#8217;mon Justin. GET MAD AT IT. Grit your teeth!&#8221;

Mark Brown is about 5&#8217;8&#8243;, 185 pounds. He can deadlift about 550, and squats at least 450. He&#8217;s about 50 years old nowadays. At the same time he can do a set of ten ring muscle ups unbroken. One of his finishers is to hook his toes over a pull-up bar and do sit-ups (bring his elbows to his thighs) with a 25 pound plate. He can do one armed chins and the flag. Another finisher is to do kip-ups off the floor to his feet. He has long hair and is one of the craziest, most amusing people that I&#8217;ve ever met.

I still think of training with Mark Brown during those dark times when I&#8217;m feeling sorry for myself. It allows me to &#8220;summon the demons&#8221;, releasing a surge of unprecedented adrenaline. The other day I was in my second Oly session in a long time. The first session I worked up to 100 and 125kg for a few singles on the snatch and CJ respectively. In this session, I had snatched up to 120 and CJ&#8217;d 140 &#8212; numbers I was happy with in my second session. I don&#8217;t have a squat rack, so in order to front squat, I have to clean the weight. I lost some weight in my hectic month, so I&#8217;m using around 5 reps with eating and sleeping well to put some weight back on. I haven&#8217;t squatted in over a month and have done some lighter front squatting until this day. I say all this because the weight I am using is not all that impressive, but I&#8217;ve accepted that I&#8217;m not purely a weightlifter.

I did 125kg on the first two sets, and I was feeling a bit knackered. Then I started thinking&#8230;What would Mark Brown do? This is what transpired.

I hope that you all can learn to summon the demons, because mindset is important for getting the most out of your body in the gym. Just ask yourself, &#8220;What would Mark Brown do?&#8221;
