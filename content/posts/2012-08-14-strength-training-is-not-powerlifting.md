However, there are some terms that are thrown around that are often misguided, confuzzled, or plain wrong, so let&#8217;s clarify them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**&#8220;I&#8217;m doing the powerlifts.&#8221;**

This is almost always said by someone coming from CrossFit, but I&#8217;ve seen it in some general populations as well. Squatting, benching, and deadlifting does _not _mean that you are powerlifting. This is like saying that tossing a football around is &#8220;playing football&#8221;. Powerlifting is a specific sport with specific demands and powerlifting, at the very least, requires that you enter a competition. Many athletes will strength train to augment their physical capacity for their sport, but it doesn&#8217;t mean they are powerlifting.

Instead, just say that you are &#8220;strength training&#8221;; it will solidify the distinction. It&#8217;s sort of ironic that powerlifting includes the word &#8220;power&#8221; since there isn&#8217;t a lot of power developed (speed is relevant in high power production). I just refer to squatting, pressing, deadlifting and other slow movements as &#8220;the strength lifts&#8221;. It helps me sleep better.

**Let&#8217;s be fair to &#8220;weightlifting&#8221; too. **

As an extension, we could say that you aren&#8217;t doing &#8220;weightlifting&#8221; if you&#8217;re snatching and clean and jerking. This misnomer isn&#8217;t as common (probably because weightlifting isn&#8217;t as accessible to the average trainee), but saying &#8220;I am doing the Olympic lifts&#8221; is more accurate. Oh, and Glenn Pendlay hates when you say &#8220;Oly&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a CrossFit thing to use certain lingo, but when it&#8217;s incorrect it alienates certain people.

**&#8220;Should I do Wendler?&#8221;**

I bet he&#8217;d fucking like that a lot, assuming you have the required equipment (a vagina, I&#8217;d assume). Jim named the program &#8220;5/3/1&#8221;, and it&#8217;s pretty simple, so let&#8217;s just say that. There&#8217;s no need to rename stuff, especially because it makes you seem like a hipster. And ___everyone_ hates hipsters.

**&#8220;High hang super power balls snatch&#8221;**

****Everything above is just nitpicking semantics (IT MATTERS, OKAY?), but this is more of helping new people with the definitions. The Olympic lifts have variations, and I will help you know them. In a biblical sense.

_If the movement is named by itself (i.e. snatch, clean), then it&#8217;s done from the floor to the fully squatted position (i.e. overhead squat or front squat to receive the bar). _

_If the movement is preceded by &#8220;hang&#8221;, it&#8217;s held in the hands while standing straight up, lowered to &#8216;second position&#8217; or the thighs, then the lift is completed as normal (fully squatted). The presence, or lack thereof, of &#8220;hang&#8221; tells you how you start. _

_If the movement is preceded by &#8220;power&#8221;, it is not caught in a squat position, but at least above 90 degrees in the knees (i.e. it is caught high in the &#8216;power position&#8217;). The presence, or lack thereof, of &#8220;power&#8221; tells you how you finish. _

_If the movement is preceded by &#8220;hang power&#8221;, then you not only start with the bar (hanging) in your hands, you also finish in the &#8216;power position&#8217;. _

There are some other variations, but if you&#8217;re having trouble with these, then let&#8217;s not worry about _those._ We don&#8217;t like their kind anyway. These variations can be used in weightlifting programs or complicated strength and conditioning programs. I say &#8220;complicated&#8221; because it&#8217;d be easier or more efficient to just say &#8220;do power cleans&#8221; instead of &#8220;hang power boner cleans&#8221;. Or something.
