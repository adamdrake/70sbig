**Weekly Challenge**

****<a href="/blog/2012/08/qa-37/" target="_blank">Last week&#8217;s challenge</a> was to do a set of continuous push-ups (no stop, no rest) until failure, rest 20 seconds, and then do another continuous set to failure. Record your reps in the comments.

**Next Week&#8217;s Challenge: **After each training session, do side plank holds (on the elbow) for 30 seconds, three sets on each side. If you have a wonky lower back issue, then note how you feel the next day.

**Week In Review**

****On Monday we raised <a href="/blog/2012/08/ali-mcweeny-is-stronger-than-that/" target="_blank">Ali McWeeny</a> about $4,000, no big deal. But seriously, we had a review of her story and how she sets an example for not giving up, and then we helped donate a bit of money for her to get a prosthetic that will let her increase her activity significantly. Tuesday consisted of some <a href="/blog/2012/08/strength-training-is-not-powerlifting/" target="_blank">clarification of some misused terms</a>; I didn&#8217;t have to try hard to offend people. On Wednesday I provided a video to help folks <a href="/blog/2012/08/finding-the-psoas/" target="_blank">find their psoas</a> so they could give it a nice little stroke (yeah buddy). Thursday I did an AMA on /r/weightroom (on reddit).

You can find the &#8220;Ask Me Anything&#8221; **<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/ybtbl/i_am_justin_lascek_i_run_70sbigcomama/" target="_blank">here</a>**, and **it will act as this week&#8217;s Q&A**. I spent 5 hours answering questions, so it&#8217;s worth a read.

**Other Stuff**

Here is a quick 2 minute hip opener that all of you should find easily accessible prior to training. Make it a point to do it, especially if you&#8217;re one of these &#8220;I sit down for over four hours a day&#8221; people.

I&#8217;ve been thinking about bringing the weekly chat room back. Thoughts?

Don&#8217;t forget the <a href="/blog/2012/08/fantasy-football-2/" target="_blank">fantasy football stuff</a>. We have some spots open for the main league and need league managers for the regional leagues.
