The Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition occurred this past weekend. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the bodybuilding competitions, male or female, since it has changed so much than the &#8220;glory days&#8221; in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s, yet there are still some interesting categories that include competitors that we can learn from.

I&#8217;ve posted some videos of Kai Greene on the site before (including mentioning him in &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/02/contraction-vs-moving-weight/" target="_blank">Contraction vs. Moving Weight</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/03/bodybuilding-fact-or-fiction/" target="_blank">Bodybuilding, Fact or Fiction?</a>&#8220;). Despite his best efforts, he only placed second at the Olympia underneath Phil Heath.

If you follow this site, you know I&#8217;m a fan of Erin Stern (I&#8217;ve written about her in posts such as &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/03/hahd-werk/" target="_blank">Hahd Werk</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/07/the-enemy/" target="_blank">The Enemy</a>&#8220;, and &#8220;<a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-2/" target="_blank">Getting Girls to Train &#8212; Part 2</a>&#8220;). She seems to have a great personality, sets a good example for good year-round nutritional and training habits, and trains explosively (with track work and some Olympic lifts). Well, <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/2012-olympia-weekend-erin-stern-wins-figure-olympia.html" target="_blank">Erin won first place</a> in the figure category this past weekend, so congratulations to her (<a href="http://streaming.bodybuilding.com/2012-olympia-webcast/?q=figure-finals-introductions-replay" target="_blank">video of finals is here</a>). The figure category is a step down from the bodybuilding category &#8212; the latter consists of creepily &#8216;roided-out women while the former is a more natural, healthy look.

Other categories include bikini, which is a fairly new style of competition that puts less emphasis on muscle mass and seemingly has no quantifiable judging criteria (though it can be entertaining for men &#8212; <a href="http://streaming.bodybuilding.com/2012-olympia-webcast/?q=bikini-olympia-confirmation-replay" target="_blank">video of the finals for proof</a>). Another interesting female category is &#8220;fitness&#8221;; these competitors are judged on both their physiques as well as a fitness routine that requires impressive ability. This typically attracts shorter, athletic girls with gymnastics or dance backgrounds. 40-year-old <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/2012-olympia-weekend-adela-garcia-wins-seventh-fitness-olympia.html" target="_blank">Adela Garcia won her seventh Fitness Olympia</a> title this past weekend (<a href="http://streaming.bodybuilding.com/2012-olympia-webcast/?q=fitness-olympia-routine-finals-replay" target="_blank">video of the fitness routines here</a>). I&#8217;d also point your attention to Oksana Grishina, a Russian and former gymnast; her routine was pretty impressive and I&#8217;ve heard grumbling that she should have won.

You may wonder why this post is about physique competitions when 70&#8217;s Big makes a point to acquire physique through performance training. I think that figure and fitness competitors set themselves apart from bodybuilding since their form is the result of function (especially for the fitness competitors). We poopoo bodybuilding as a whole, but the truth is that there are many good role models to look up to &#8212; consistent and hard-training people like Erin Stern or the impressive Adela Garcia, a 40-year-old woman who can &#8220;out-athlete&#8221; anyone half her age.

Sure, our end goal or training methods are different, but there is still a lot we can learn from these women. Erin Stern, for example, stays quite lean year-round with healthy eating &#8212; something that&#8217;s incredibly difficult mentally and physically. She commits herself to excellency not only in the gym, but outside of it. That is certainly a lesson that we, male or female, can benefit from. I can think of worse female role models than hard-working women who eat right and set goals.
