There are two dichotomous styles of weightlifting. One is sort of a relic of the past and puts an emphasis on jumping the bar up while the other focuses on efficiently getting under the bar. In &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/01/jumpshrug-vs-catapult/" target="_blank">Jump/shrug vs &#8216;Catapult</a>&#8216;&#8221; I briefly discussed the differences between these techniques. The primary difference is that if the bar is jumped vertically, the lifter and bar become &#8220;floaty&#8221;, making it difficult to have an efficient turnover to rack the bar. The &#8220;get under&#8221; method sets the lifter up to not only have greater turnover speed, but to use more efficient mechanical positioning to maximize their force production.

The key is that the &#8220;get under&#8221; method is necessary for lifting loads that are significantly greater than body weight. Personally I can tell the difference between the two methods; I was taught to use the jump method and have taught myself the &#8220;get under&#8221; technique, though I&#8217;m probably not perfect. I&#8217;m lifting the same PR loads weighing 15 pounds lighter and without back squatting for a couple of months. The &#8220;jump&#8221; method is good for general strength and conditioning (especially with non-lifting sport athletes), but it&#8217;s less efficient when trying to lift the most weight (i.e. Olympic weightlifting).

This post isn&#8217;t meant to be a full biomechanical analysis of the &#8220;get under&#8221; technique (that can come later), but the technique&#8217;s starting position and execution better produce a stretch reflex on both the quads and hamstrings. This not only allows these muscles to produce force maximally, yet makes the bar-lifter mechanics more efficient. For example, if a person is snatching significantly more than their body weight, then manipulating the bar-lifter center of mass is important, but it&#8217;s not as simple as making the bar &#8220;go up&#8221; vertically.

There are two standard cues used after the initial motor pathway of the lift are learned: &#8220;bar back&#8221; and &#8220;finish in the heels&#8221;. Keeping the bar back prevents it from swinging forward, disrupting the delicate bar-lifter system. Even slight alterations to center of mass with very heavy loads will create exponential mechanical problems that result in a failed lift. Finishing in the heels ensures that the lifter doesn&#8217;t put an emphasis on &#8220;up&#8221;, prevents the lifter from floating, and sets them up to transfer into their heals in the bottom of a snatch or clean. It also facilitates the finish &#8220;arched back&#8221; position &#8212; a necessary difference to snatch or clean heavy loads.

To keep the bar back, a lifter will actively need to extend their shoulder joint (if the elbow is straight, shoulder extension pushes the wrist behind the body &#8212; see the &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/13_Nq4QgALs" target="_blank">Anatomy Motion Explained</a>&#8221; video for a review). This same thing occurs on a deadlift to prevent the bar from swinging forward, but it&#8217;s absolutely critical in the Olympic lifts. It&#8217;s the difference between a good lift and a bad lift. For some, it can be the difference between a good lift and annihilating their dugan and coin purse. Observe what happens when the bar isn&#8217;t kept back:

Okay, this might be an extreme example. My arm length may facilitate nut crunching, but leaving the bar out front changed the mechanics to bring the bar into my body at a different trajectory. Let&#8217;s look at the same problem on the snatch from earlier in the same training session. I had not snatched 130 in a while, and I was feeling good in warm-ups that particular August day. You&#8217;ll see that I miss 130 three times in a row. You&#8217;ll also see that it seems like I easily complete the lift, and then it falls forward. It&#8217;s because my lack of &#8220;keeping the bar back&#8221; puts the bar in a slightly forward position &#8212; maybe by a few  centimeters &#8212; and results in a missed lift. I even spiked my adrenaline for the second and third lifts to no avail. Finally, on the fourth attempt, I focused on keeping the bar back and made a good lift with significantly lower adrenaline levels.

As a side note, look how different the mechanics are from <a href="http://youtu.be/iZFKv6dfmiI" target="_blank">this video</a>. Yikes.

I learned why keeping the bar back was important by missing a doable snatch three times in a row and smashing my sausage on a clean. Most of you probably won&#8217;t be able to discern your problems on the spot, so I suggest watching the <a href="http://californiastrength.com/olympic-weightlifting-videos/viewcategory/12/olympic-weightlifting" target="_blank">Pendlay teaching progressions on Cal Strength&#8217;s website</a> and routinely executing the basic cues (like &#8220;bar back&#8221; and &#8220;finish in your heels&#8221;). Your beef bugle will thank you.
