By the time of this post I&#8217;ll be in Denver, Colorado for the Great American Beer Festival. I&#8217;ll also have been in the wilderness by myself for a couple of days, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there.

I&#8217;ve always wanted to teach and entertain through 70&#8217;s Big, but I also like to help you stay motivated, inspired, and ready to kick the wall down every time you train. Mike linked me the following video, and I thought it was powerful enough to share. If we can all keep this drive, motivation, and consistency in our lives, then impossibility is no longer in our vocabulary.
