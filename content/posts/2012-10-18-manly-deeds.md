In &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/09/qa-43/" target="_blank">Q&A &#8211; 43</a>&#8221; I asked readers to perform as many manly deeds as possible to win a 70&#8217;s Big shirt. They were pretty interesting or amusing, so I thought a separate post would be good.

> Manly deeds: carried boxes of books for a teacher, created sucrose solutions of varying molarity for bio teacher(manly?), helped my elderly neighbor move junk out of her house, spread training knowledge, snatched 205 and cl and j 245 at 190 bw 3 weeks after starting Olympic lifts, and finally my highschool lacrosse coach officially dubbed me “the beast” and said I look like a man playing among boys.

> Manly deeds: 1) completed navigation and tour of the California coast with my new wife in a rented mustang convertable. I’d never been there before and neither had she. Most days I wore short shorts, except for when it was too cold I wore pants similar to vietnam-era BDUs. One day we completed a 10-mile loop through a state park in Big Sur covering stunning beaches, mountains and redwoods, all without a map. I mean I looked at the map at the entrance, then went with it from there. I didn’t want to leave. During this time I grew a beard as a place holder so that I could have a mustache (not really possible to grow a mustache solo IMHO). Day 10 I shaved the beard with a shitty disposable razor and left the mustache. When I got home my electric shaver was packed in a moving box so I shaved 18 days of growth off of my lip with a dull disposable razor. 2) This morning I noticed one of my chest hairs almost touches one of my throat hairs. They day the two sections legitimately merge will be nothing short of monumental in my life.

> &#8211; i helped em…not totaly normal girl which is overweight with exercises, she takes care of mentally disabled people (she kinda is…well in that team) but wanted to lose some weight and get more social with people, i will take care of her for some time. she can squat now, yet she doesnt quite now why she should, but we are working on it : ) it’s hard to comunicate with her, but im learning to.
  
> &#8211; i took my friends with their girlfriends to the gym . and thought them all to squat, soo 4 people more squatting:D girls loved it. that’s all, not quite a lot..

Basically taedoju is saying that he helped a mentally handicapped girl in the gym. My older brother is mentally handicapped and I grew up around a lot of handicapped kids, therefore I have a special place in my heart for them. Most people are afraid to approach them since they are different, but they typically really enjoy interaction with people. Taedoju wins the manly award for going out of his way to communicate and help with the mentally handicapped girl; it&#8217;s a really kind thing to do. The kind of thing a man does.
