_Mondays are dedicated to female topics. _

I&#8217;ve spent so much time trying to help guys get their the women in their lives training that I&#8217;ve neglected the gals who actually DO train. You lovely ladies actually carry the torch &#8212; the one that sets fire to bullshit conventional cardio bunny stereotypes.

<a href="http://youtu.be/-tS6QfIZfKY" target="_blank">In this video</a>, Nick Offerman of <a href="/2012/07/RON-SWANSON-ADVICE.jpg" target="_blank">Ron Swanson fame</a> reads tweets by young female celebrities. Ashley Tisdale &#8212; who I honestly have never heard of before &#8212; said, &#8220;Cardio then yoga? I am gonna be sore!&#8221; This is a god damn joke. Aside from the fact that it&#8217;s one of those pointless-ass status updates that reflect the epitome of narcissism in American youth, the girl expects to be sore from repetitive movement on an elliptical, stretching, and posing. FUCKING POSING.

Ladies. This is what we&#8217;re up against.

Wait, this isn&#8217;t supposed to be about the enemy. Let&#8217;s try and ignore her internal rotation and thoracic flexion. Let&#8217;s try and ignore her complete lack of muscle mass. Let&#8217;s try and ignore the fact that if she were to be caught in a stiff breeze, she would fall apart.

No, this is about you ladies &#8212; you lifting, training ladies &#8212; carrying that torch, lighter fluid, and trebuchet to burn down the preconceived notion that being a useless human being WILL NOT STAND. I salute you, woman of barbell lifting.

Tell us about yourself. How did you get into lifting and serious training? Why do you like it? What do you hope to get out of it? There is no wrong answer, I&#8217;m just curious as to what was the catalyst for setting yourself apart from the waif or fat girl modern society expected you to be.

Continue to pave the way for serious female trainees by setting a good example. If possible, help your friends &#8212; male and female &#8212; try it out. Find your niche, whether it&#8217;s just getting stronger, powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting, or strongman, and stick with it. Train hard and have fun.
