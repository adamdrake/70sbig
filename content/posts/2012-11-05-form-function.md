Today I was at a loss of what to write about for the female post. I&#8217;ve written about how society negatively affects the body image of women and how lifting can help modify it. I&#8217;ve written about how the gals who do lift can set a good example to try and encourage non-lifting women to try it out &#8212; or get their friends in the gym period. I&#8217;ve written about how guys can convince the lady friends in their lives to train and explain why &#8220;doing cardio&#8221; is futile, irrelevant, and inefficient. I&#8217;ve written about programs, developing a pull-up, correcting mechanics, improving muscle imbalances, and what to do if a girl cries in training.

The first person that comes to mind is Olympian Holly Mangold (right).

I don&#8217;t know Holly Mangold. I&#8217;m the first to say that the picture I chose for the post couldn&#8217;t be worse, but this is what girls of all ages see. I&#8217;ve seen this exact picture all over the internet mocking Holly, weightlifters, lifters, as well as being used as in &#8220;fat girl memes&#8221;. Most women don&#8217;t see this picture as someone who is near the pinnacle of lifting, but someone who looks grotesque. Lifting already has a bad enough stigma, but then you attach this face to it and I can hear the teenage girls (who actually exercise) run to the celebrity waif trainers.

To make matters worse, MTV &#8212; the shittiest network ever &#8212; did a special on her over a year ago (I&#8217;d link it but I refuse to give them clicks). This solidifies the idea that &#8220;weightlifting&#8221; and &#8220;fat&#8221; are synonymous. It doesn&#8217;t matter that we know this <a href="/blog/2011/11/nude-weightlifters/" target="_blank">couldn&#8217;t be farther from the truth</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t matter what _we _think. What matters is that the anti-lifting dogma is only made worse. Imagine every asshole personal trainer telling their new female client, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to lift; did you see that big girl at the Olympics? Do you want to look like her?&#8221;

Sure, Holly has athletically accomplished more in four years of a sport that everyone &#8212; including me &#8212; could only dream about; she qualified for the Olympics and placed 10th in the world. But my focus is on the big picture. Yes, I think Holly is abhorrently fat. No, I don&#8217;t think she should die because of it. No, I don&#8217;t want her feelings to be hurt, but I also don&#8217;t care about her feelings. She&#8217;s an Olympian now, and that means she&#8217;s been awarded with the fact that she is a role model whether she likes it or not. Her physique is not necessary for her performance and she will do more harm than good to the sport of weightlifting &#8212; and lifting in general &#8212; by failing to do something about it.

This isn&#8217;t just my opinion; it&#8217;s how society works. We are all judgmental assholes. We judge personality on outward appearance. There&#8217;s so much sensory and data input in our lives that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to function if we didn&#8217;t do this. If anything, it&#8217;s a necessarily selected trait in order to function and survive in civilization. Besides, you can&#8217;t look me in the eye and tell me that a 17-year-old girl is not going to have a negative view of female weightlifting after watching Holly&#8217;s MTV special. Ptsh, you couldn&#8217;t even truthfully tell me that the teenage girl would have a _neutral_ view of it. If I&#8217;m wrong about society, I&#8217;m definitely not wrong about a shallow air head who watches reality TV.

The good news is that it&#8217;s not like Holly can&#8217;t do anything about it. She&#8217;s an Olympian. She should have the capacity to set her mind to a goal, work towards it, and achieve it. She has the ability to tighten her diet and training regime and come into the 2016 games looking svelte and hitting PRs. It&#8217;s not like I expect her to compete as a 75kg/165lb lifter (the second heaviest female weight class), but there&#8217;s no reason she needs to weigh 165kgs/363lbs. And if she fails to do this again (she&#8217;s tried in the past), then she fails female weightlifting, exacerbates the image of female lifting, and further poisons the misconception of female body type and legitimate training methods. I&#8217;m rooting for Holly Mangold, but it&#8217;s solely on her plate.
