Tomorrow will be the 70&#8217;s Big Thanksgiving Weight Gain Challenge. To clarify, submissions will consist of pre/post weigh-ins (on film) and extra points will be awarded to funny stuff. Be sure to check tomorrow&#8217;s post before filming (it&#8217;ll post at midnight).

Meanwhile, the friends at 70&#8217;s Big are all training well. Chris and Mike are getting ready for another strongman competition and AC is pressing his wang off. The fourth video are outtakes from USAPL Nationals and was <del>fair at best</del> amusing.

AC presses 270&#215;2:
