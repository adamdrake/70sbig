Today&#8217;s post compiles the results of the annualÂ <a href="/blog/2012/11/thanksgiving-weight-challenge-2012/" target="_blank">2012 Thanksgiving Weight Gain Challenge</a>. Each video was pretty funny and worth watching. I&#8217;ve made a table of the winners in each category:

<p style="text-align: center;">

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Most of the contenders weighed about the same, so the &#8220;Percent of Body Weight&#8221; category did not vary much from the &#8220;Absolute Gain&#8221; category. The heaviest guys were Joe Bloom and Rob Brown (start weight of 225 and 236.6 respectively). Lightest guys were criedthefox (Brian) and Daren Welsh (176.5 and 184.6 respectively). Of the 11 contenders, there was a total weight gain of 86.5 pounds.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Willey&#8217;s winning results are surprising because he started at 191 and gained 13 pounds, but his discomfort seemed sincere in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/440YoexaVd8" target="_blank">post weigh-in video</a>. One contender can&#8217;t win both categories, so Daren Welsh will win the other (he&#8217;s second in both).

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As for &#8220;funniest video&#8221;, I have narrowed it down to a few. I want to point out that I thought all of the videos were amusing, so give &#8217;em a watch. We will choose the funniest video in this post&#8217;s comments out of the following x:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  criedthefox clearly spent a lot of time on this year&#8217;s entry. He went from 176.5 to 184.5. Will he retain the title?<br /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/coQ0vBKINd4" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>

Zach Paulus has really come out of no where this year. Literally. In this video he said he used to weigh 135 and weighed in at 188.2, so he&#8217;s been hard at work (his second weigh-in put him at 194.6). This video is a must-watch. Don&#8217;t make fun of him.

Alphantis did two quick vids, but I laughed really fucking hard at the end of this first video. He went from 187 to 193.5.

newgetelqueso participates in the challenge from the Middle East and questions a girl on manly qualities. He went from 75.6 to 78.6kg (his response to kilos is good).

Daren Welsh&#8217;s video is very good, and he sports a nice mustache (which undoubtedly helped him win), but he can&#8217;t win another award. He went from 184.6 to 194.6 for an even 10 pound gain.

The others with comments from memory:

Rob Brown&#8217;s girlfriend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vEXa8Mk79dI" target="_blank">brought a scale in her purse</a> to Cracker Barrell and at the end of the video Rob presses her (she squeals with delight). Rob went from 236.6 to 241 in about 45 minutes of eating. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t include a category for most weight gained in shortest amount of time.

Joe Bloom went from 225 to 235 and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qYNZDpxA8gk" target="_blank">makes a porno joke with his wife</a>.

Mike Innola went from 188.8 to 195.8 and is quite clearly drunk in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/k1wbP3roQYg" target="_blank">second weigh-in</a>.

Broseph went from 192.8 to 201.6 and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oz9_QbDsNpo" target="_blank">caught a pump prior to going on camera</a>.

Austin went from 194.4 to 200.2 and is in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2wjKI31xUX4" target="_blank">middle of his third trimester</a>.

Well done to the contenders. We&#8217;ll see you in 2013.
