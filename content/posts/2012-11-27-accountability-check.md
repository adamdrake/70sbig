I haven&#8217;t posted anything on <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">protein</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/09/water-and-protein/" target="_blank">water</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/08/public-service-announcement-toe-angle/" target="_blank">mobility</a>, or <a href="/blog/2012/02/garbage-in-garbage-out/" target="_blank">nutrition</a> in a while and I feel that doing so makes you consider your habits. Have the guys been eating one gram of protein per pound of body weight plus fifty (e.g. a 200 pound male would hit a minimum of 250g of protein)? Have the gals been aiming for almost 1g per pound of body weight? Are you drinking half your body weight in ounces of water (e.g. a 200 pound male would drink 100 oz of water)? Are you doing daily mobility to improve your movement limitations or painful areas? Are you returning to a clean diet after last week&#8217;s eating extravaganza?

These are the little things that make or break your training. Any child can go into the weight room and attack the barbell, but it takes a professional to pay attention to details outside of the gym. If you&#8217;re encountering recovery problems &#8212; and aren&#8217;t using stupid amounts of volume, intensity, or frequency &#8212; then look to how well you&#8217;re adhering to the above &#8220;outside of the gym&#8221; aspects of training. If you&#8217;ve read this site for a while, you should  be thinking &#8220;duh&#8221;, but at the same time you may realize you haven&#8217;t been hitting your daily protein requirements.

Remember that recovery is not a glass of water that you can quickly fill or empty; it&#8217;s a continuum. Eating 300+ grams of protein, doing an entire hour of mobility, or over hydrating in one day might be impressive, but it amounts to precisely dick if you don&#8217;t do it regularly. You should be consistent enough so that you don&#8217;t require a cram session. It&#8217;s the same thing as lifting: if you haven&#8217;t lifted in a week, you can&#8217;t make up for lost time by squatting 20 sets of 5 in your next workout. The concept makes sense in the gym, so act the same outside of it.

If you&#8217;re sitting there wondering why you haven&#8217;t squatted 405 or pressed your body weight, it might be because you don&#8217;t take your training seriously&#8230;which is fine if you don&#8217;t want to hit your goals. Spending 5 to 10 hours of your week toiling with the iron is more than a fucking hobby; quit dicking around and <a href="http://youtu.be/SCFfCPX6Nr8" target="_blank">get serious</a>.  Do you want to be an imposing physical specimen who lets children do chin-ups off of your biceps after pressing a car? Then realize that these &#8220;little things&#8221; _are_ training and get to work.
