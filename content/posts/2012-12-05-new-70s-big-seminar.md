This seminar weekend is significant for a few reasons.

1. **I&#8217;m polishing and adding new material, particularly the mobility stuff**. Day #2 now includes a Mobility portion prior to the lectures. Day 1 consists of attendees getting coached in lifting and Day 2 consists of a &#8216;mobility workshop&#8217; in the morning and &#8216;how to program&#8217; lectures for the rest of the day. Saturday&#8217;s lifting portion will provide the same coaching, but will have focused points of emphasis in a way that lets the attendee take them home to implement in coaching or training  The mobility portion will feature material that I haven&#8217;t ever taught on the site or in seminars. The programming lectures are being reworked and improved (I constantly work on the material with each seminar I do, but this is an overhaul to present it differently).

2. **This is the last seminar I&#8217;ll be doing for a while. **This means that east coast folks on the fence about attending should make a point of getting a spot.

3. **The seminar will be filmed. **I don&#8217;t think this changes the experience for the attendee; if anything it elevates the level in which information is presented and taught (I&#8217;m already working on the material).

This seminar will be the best one I&#8217;ve ever done, so I hope you can make it. We always have a fine meal on Saturday evening (location undecided, but it&#8217;s been all you can eat Korean BBQ in the past) and CF Annandale has increased in size since the last seminar. If you have attended a seminar in the past, you&#8217;re eligible for a discount assuming you purchase both days (just <a href="mailto:justin@70sbig.com" target="_blank">shoot me an e-mail</a> with &#8220;SEMINAR&#8221; in the subject).
