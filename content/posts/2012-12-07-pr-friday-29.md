I&#8217;m not at home, so here is a quick post. Post your PR&#8217;s and training updates to comments. Also ask questions for next week&#8217;s Q&A.

&nbsp;

Justin asked me to post a &#8220;good pic or video&#8221; to today&#8217;s post, so here you go:

First up is a video from the weightlifters at Northern Michigan University during their prep for the American Open. NMU is a US Olympic Education Center.

Next, we have a video taken by 70&#8217;s Big member Tbone of a few notable lifts at the American Open:

And finally, a friendly reminder from 70&#8217;s big member Paul Sousa to not bite the horses
