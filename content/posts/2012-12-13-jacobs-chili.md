_In January of 2010, Gant asked Jacob Cloud to make a video about one of his chili recipes. I realized that because of a technical issue, the videos were removed from the post, and wanted to re-post them. The videos are entertaining and educational, but look how young and beardless ol&#8217; Jacob looks.&nbsp;_

Make some Texas Chili this weekend. To help with this, Jacob Cloud has sent in a video. This video has everything: history, training, Texas beer, mild hazing, and skillet corn bread! Yes!

Here is his recipe list:
  
2 lbs course ground beef
  
2.5 lbs tri-tip, trimmed and cubed
  
1 can peeled whole tomatoes
  
1 can Rotel
  
1-2 minced jalapenos (more or less depending on how spicy you want it)
  
4-5 crushed/minced garlic cloves
  
1/2-1 cup chopped white onion
  
1/4-1/2 cup chopped cilantro
  
Lime juice from 1 large lime
  
Thickener (corn starch, masa, flour, etc)
  
6 pack of Texan beer

Chili Mix (all measurements heaping!):
  
2-3 tbsp chili powder
  
1+ tbsp cumin
  
1 tsp ancho chili powder
  
1 tsp chipotle chili powder
  
1 tsp paprika
