**PR Friday:** Post your training updates and PR’s to the comments.

**Weekly Recap: **<a href="/blog/2012/12/addressing-spinal-hyper-mobility/" target="_blank">Addressing Spinal Hyper Mobility</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/12/quality-over-quantity/" target="_blank">Quality > Quantity</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/12/just-because-you-can/" target="_blank">Just Because You Can</a>,  and <a href="/blog/2012/12/jacobs-chili/" target="_blank">Jacob&#8217;s Chili</a>.

I&#8217;ve been debating doing Q&As on Fridays &#8212; thoughts? They don&#8217;t seem to get much of a response. That being said, go ahead and post questions to comments.

I made a video to piggy back off of the post on Monday about <a href="/blog/2012/12/addressing-spinal-hyper-mobility/" target="_blank">spinal hyper mobility</a>. The post was about a Mobility WOD video that stresses the importance of external hip rotation when pulling to engage musculature around the hips. The video I made explains how stance width will effect the ability to externally rotate along with some other tidbits.

And to give you some other stuff to chew on over the weekend, here&#8217;s an awesome video with Swedish strongman Magnus Samuelsson. It starts with an emphasis on his arm training, but gets into some other stuff. I thought it was interesting because of how the &#8216;online training community&#8217; shuns arm training with cited reasons of &#8220;vanity&#8221; or &#8220;functionality&#8221;. Well, strong arms serve a practical purpose instead of just looking massive, and strengthening them is vital in strongman. It&#8217;s a good lesson to take from strongman training: train your entire body and do not neglect certain body parts.
