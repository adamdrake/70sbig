November and December represent a time of year when people almost purposely eat unhealthy with the comforting idea that they will rectify all of their bad choices at the start of the new year.

To be clear, I&#8217;ve always been a proponent to **enjoy your holidays**. I hate when these OCD people with borderline food disorders go and tell everyone to maintain a strict diet on Thanksgiving or Christmas. I can&#8217;t think of worse advice since this will only develop the person to hate themselves if they do indulge in a Christmas cookie or pumpkin pie. My advice: enjoy the holiday, but keep it controlled acutely and don&#8217;t turn &#8220;holiday&#8221; into &#8220;two weeks&#8221;.

All of that being said, you might be a person that necessitates an adherence to good nutrition. If you are fat, unhealthy, or ill, then you should make it a point to eat clean, quality foods (i.e. no grains, primarily meat and vegetables, aim to improve insulin sensitivity, etc.). You do not get a reprieve just because it&#8217;s Christmas; your health is more important than anything else. It, at the very least, effects not only your enjoyment of daily activities, but your productiveness. If I&#8217;m your boss, I want you being alert, energetic, and effective instead of lethargic, ineffective, and in pain.

Nevertheless, everyone provides a mental comfort with the idea that they can dick around towards the end of the year because they&#8217;ll &#8220;get on the right track&#8221; in the beginning of the year. Bullshit. What&#8217;s so special about flipping a calendar? If something is important to you, do it right. fucking. now.

It&#8217;s one thing to reduce your training frequency on the account of spending time with family, stressing to buy presents, or prepare for a holiday tradition, but if you&#8217;re slacking on the account of laziness or the promise that you&#8217;ll do better in ten days, then sort your life out. Health should be important to you &#8212; and training probably is &#8212; so put the emphasis on those things.

I wish I would have written this a month ago, but don&#8217;t cripple yourself just because everyone else around you is weak minded. Whatever your &#8220;resolution&#8221; was going to be &#8212; reading more, starting a journal, mobbing more, eating healthier, establishing a training routine, being nicer, learning a new subject &#8212; just simply start doing it. If you have logistical limitations that&#8217;s fine, but don&#8217;t let your mind be the limitation.
