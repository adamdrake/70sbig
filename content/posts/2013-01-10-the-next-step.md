Last Friday you were tasked with pulling your balls out from between your legs and committing to a competition. The day you sign up will be one of the greatest days of your life because your training will suddenly have new meaning. You won&#8217;t understand this until the end of the competition. You&#8217;ll either walk away from the competition&#8217;s last effort thinking, &#8220;This was one of the best experiences of my life and I can&#8217;t wait to do it again,&#8221; or &#8220;I could have been better, I _should_ have been better, next time I will reach my full potential.&#8221; Either way, you will be of the mindset that your life craves competition, _needs_ it.

If you haven&#8217;t signed up for something: do it. There&#8217;s no better time to sign up. It&#8217;s like cleaning a toilet; the longer you wait, the more it stinks and the less likely you will be to do anything about it.

Assuming you&#8217;ve signed up, it&#8217;s now time to ensure your training is efficient so that you have a fun and successful first competition. Most likely you can just keep doing whatever program you&#8217;re doing now, but just do it better. Increase your bar speed on every rep. It&#8217;s easy to go through the motions, but when you actually grit your teeth, clench your B-hole, and attack every rep like it owes you money/sex/bacon/chocolate, you&#8217;ll accomplish much more. Make the bar go fast; make the weights go boom.

If your program has a lot of dicking around &#8212; activities that will not improve your performance in the competition &#8212; then cut them out. This is, of course, an individualistic and circumstantial thing, but you don&#8217;t need to do conditioning or irrelevant assistance exercises in the six weeks before your lifting meet (other competitions may have different guidelines). Let this be a time where you train primarily for something, and you&#8217;ll be rewarded with good progress. Especially if you put a premium on spending all of your recovery resources on specific training (i.e. recovering from compound strength lifts instead chest flyes and wiener lifts).

Next, pay attention to the &#8220;outside the gym recovery&#8221;. Improve your <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">daily protein requirement</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/09/water-and-protein/" target="_blank">hydrate</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/12/importance-of-sleep/" target="_blank">sleep</a>, do your <a href="/blog/2011/06/mobility-basics/" target="_blank">mobility </a>(this post is a little dated, I&#8217;ll write a new one), and <a href="/blog/2012/02/garbage-in-garbage-out/" target="_blank">eat well</a>. If you do any of these things poorly, you will not be as prepared for your competition as you could be. If you don&#8217;t go 9/9 in powerlifting or 6/6 in weightlifting with PR&#8217;s, then you could have done something better. To be clear, PR&#8217;s are not necessarily the goal in competition because competition lifts are different than gym lifts. But, if you walk away from a good or bad competition thinking you could have done better, chances are that these &#8220;outside the gym recovery&#8221; variables could have been improved. And they can&#8217;t just be worked on a few times a week like lifting &#8212; they have to be done well every day.

**Summary**

Commit to something. Bash the shit out of quality reps in training and then start good habits outside of the gym. Eliminate the fluff in your program. Have a week of reduced training leading into the competition and be smart with weight choices (there are many resources on this site pertaining to meets), and you&#8217;ll walk away knowing that you busted your ass for something, and it paid off. Is there a better feeling?
