****I am a firm believer in holistic training throughout life. Developing the body is why we are all here, but improving mental and emotional strength is just as important. We know that mental and emotional aptitude can be a corollary to quality physical training, yet to reach full potential we need dedicated time to develop them &#8212; just like strength, conditioning, speed, or agility.

Today we&#8217;re focusing on mental capacity. True, some of you may require a level of intellect to conduct your job or deal with your life, but that is akin to believing you can get stronger just by shoveling some dirt and going to work. So let&#8217;s take some time out of our day or week to better our minds.

Some of you are already shaking your heads. &#8220;I have a wife, kids, work, and training. How can I possibly add anything else to my day?&#8221; I&#8217;ve always had the mentality that you can dedicate one fifteen minute period of your day to _something_. There are 96 periods of 15 minutes in a day (4 fifteen minute periods in an hour x 24 hours in a day = 96 fifteen minute periods). You can certainly spend one of those 96 periods &#8212; hell, you can spend five dedicated minutes to mental training. So make the time.

Basically you should aim to stimulate your mind with critical thinking. Think of the mind as a muscle, and without this dedicated training it will grow soft and weak. There are several great ways to do this like doing mental math, playing chess, doing sudoku (though I&#8217;ve never gotten into them), or solve puzzles. There are many mental math apps available on the iPhone or Droid OS. The one I have gives you two minutes to solve as many simple math problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as you can. The difficulty increases with your prowess. For some people, 737/67 might result in an instantaneous solution, but others whose math skills have grown dusty will need a moment of strained thought.

When I first moved to Texas &#8212; and before I became friends with Brent and Chris &#8212; I would sit in my house at night and do physics problems until one or two in the morning. They weren&#8217;t terribly hard (usually simple alegbra), but I felt it would keep or make me sharp. At least it passed the time when I didn&#8217;t have any friends in Texas (Debbie Downer music).

Playing chess is a fantastic and stimulating activity. I have seen studies that say there isn&#8217;t a correlation between IQ and chess ability, but we&#8217;re not intending to use chess as a means to a higher IQ. We&#8217;re using it to stimulate the critical thinking areas of our mind. I&#8217;m an inexperienced chess player, but when I play I have to consider the implications of my move and subsequent possible actions in my opponent. I take entirely too long to make a move, so I suspect that playing with a clock will force me to speed the analyzing process up and take higher risks in the match. I believe that doing this regularly, and under pressure, will only help develop this &#8220;analyze, plan, and act&#8221; process in other areas of my life.

Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s father would force him and his brother to do math problems when they were boys. And throughout his life Arnold would play chess &#8212; even on the plane while serving as the Governor of California. Mental strength is a necessary tool for success, so let&#8217;s keep our skills sharp by spending a few minutes of dedicated training each day.

**Questions: What mental training techniques have you used in the past? What do you currently use? What are other good ways to train the mind?**
