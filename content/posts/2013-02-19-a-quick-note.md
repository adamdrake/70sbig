Dear 70&#8217;s Big Readers,

I have accepted a position that will limit my ability to write for 70&#8217;s Big for a few months. In order to be successful I will not have time to reply to messages on the website, social media, or e-mail. Fortunately, Jacob Cloud will continue to help in his new role as Editor and will make sure you are supplied with quality, entertaining content.Â I&#8217;ll be around &#8212; helping Jacob &#8212; but I won&#8217;t be interacting as much.

Even though this website is a part of my personality and life, throughout the years I&#8217;ve made it a point to hold onto some element of privacy. Thank you for not violating my privacy by repeatedly asking about it.

Enjoy the site, get edu-muh-cated, have a good time, train hard, and eat well.

&#8211;Justin
