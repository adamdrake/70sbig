It&#8217;s finally here &#8211; this is the week of the <a href="http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/" target="_blank">Arnold Sports Festival</a>, which runs this Thursday to Sunday in Columbus, Ohio, and is so massively awesome, it might make you shit your pants. You&#8217;ve been warned. If you do, just own it.

This is a huge deal. We have a bunch of 70sBig lifters competing, a lot of readers attending, and there will be more sports and competitions and displays than we could possibly begin to preview, or cover. Luckily, I&#8217;m guessing not many of you care as much about the &#8220;5k Pump &#8216;N Run&#8221; or the World Jump Rope Championships, and we&#8217;ll be sticking to covering mostly the lifting exploits, and probably a few pictures of the IFBB stuff just for funsies.

In the spirit of Ladies&#8217; Mondays, I thought I&#8217;d highlight two female weightlifters who will be competing on Saturday, and whose coaches actually post on here.

Glenn Pendlay is a household name in our world (unless you&#8217;re ow3n), and his MuscleDriver USA team will be very well-represented at the Arnold, which also serves as the qualifier for the Pan-Ams. I think he&#8217;s coaching around 9 athletes, which sounds pretty much like cardio. We&#8217;ll cover some of the guys later in the week, but you already know Jon North is one of &#8217;em. Did you realize, however, that Jon&#8217;s wife is also competing? Jessica is a ton of fun to watch in the MDUSA training streams, because her quiet intensity and determination is inspiring as hell. Check out this video, ignore the cheesy music (really, Jon, really?), and tune in Saturday to see how she does in the 75kg class.

[Big Ben &#8220;Brown Thunder&#8221; Claridad][1] has also been a friend of the site for a long time, and was teaching us all how important it was to have ginormous arms before we even knew who CT Fletcher was. He&#8217;s not only competing (105+), but also coaching two female lifters, Emelie (75+) and Cecily (69). I haven&#8217;t met Emelie, but I can attest to the fact that Cecily is just as fun and inspiring to watch as Jess North. When I briefly met her and Ben at Cal-Strength, I got to witness one of the most badass jerk recoveries of all time. Little did I know she would make a habit of it.

    Amanda and Jess at Raw Nats
  </p>
</div>

In Powerlifting, I could go on and on about at least half of the female competitors. There are several who have posted on here in the past, and several who I&#8217;ve met in person and are flat out awesome. Amanda Padgett&#8217;s long humble discussion with my special lady friend at Raw Nats is something Jess still smiles about to this day. She also loves to tell the story about her competitor, the one-and-only Jennifer Thompson, taking time to cheer her on mid-meet. JT is one of the best powerlifters of all time, male or female, and at last year&#8217;s Arnold, <a href="/blog/2012/03/jennifer-thompson/" target="_blank">she broke the 300lb bench barrier</a> &#8211; raw and drug tested &#8211; at 132 pounds. I think she&#8217;s going to break that this year&#8230; Check out this vid she put out in the past week of her smoking a 305lb training lift.

We&#8217;ll continue coverage this week of more lifters, more sports, more hookers, and more blow. If you&#8217;re attending the Arnold and would like to submit some photos, I&#8217;d appreciate it &#8211; click on <a href="/submissions/" target="_blank">Submissions</a> and get&#8217;r&#8217;dun.
