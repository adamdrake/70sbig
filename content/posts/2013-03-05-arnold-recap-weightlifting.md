Well, the weekend of the Arnold is over. Sadly, I did not attend this year, but I was constantly in contact with various field reporters and friends who were on-site, and I&#8217;m already looking forward to Arnold 2014, where I hope to be coaching several lifters. We&#8217;ll have a pretty big gathering of 70sBig folks for sure. Did any of you meet up and share mead? Were you able to watch the multitude of our community who competed? Did you get a cool shirt, at least? (Many thanks to my lifter Ben, who brought me one back!)

Last Monday, we <a href="/blog/2013/02/the-arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrnold-is-here/" target="_blank">previewed</a> some of the female weightlifters (along with Jennifer Thompson&#8230;who, spoiler alert, broke her own bench world record!). Now, you can check out the results, since you couldn&#8217;t watch it live. (Note: I&#8217;m still waiting on the ACTUAL results sheet to be posted, but keep clicking the facebook pages below since that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll be sourcing them from).

The Columbus Weightlifting Club holds this annual meet, which is no small feat. There are countless hours of work involved in putting on the Arnold Weightlifting Championships, so give them some credit. They have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColumbusWeightlifting" target="_blank">team facebook page</a>, but also an Arnold-specific one <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArnoldWeightliftingChampionships" target="_blank">HERE</a>.

Note that they recently asked &#8220;Only 361 days until Arnold 2014!! What would you like to see next year?&#8221; I suggest letting them know that livestreaming the lifting is something you&#8217;d be interested in, if that&#8217;s the case. I will be suggesting that, at least.

In any case, they posted most of the videos online relatively quickly. You can search through various parameters and find who you want to see <a title="Tons of videos" href="http://www.dartfish.tv/Presenter.aspx?CR=p90777c60150" target="_blank">HERE</a>.

There are also some great photos from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hookgripdotcom" target="_blank">hookgrip.com</a>. I don&#8217;t know these guys, but they have by far the best photos of Olympic Weightlifting you&#8217;ll see on the internet. Go to their facebook page and like them. You won&#8217;t be sorry.

So, there are the links. Let&#8217;s open this up for discussion. How did you feel about not being able to watch the weightlifting on the internet? How do you feel about the coverage this event received? Did you know it was the Pan-Am qualifier? Whose performance was the most impressive to you, and which performances were you disappointed by?
