_During the Arnold Sports Festival Mike Jenkins was kind enough to let me interview him in the Rogue booth. Unfortunately, the two minute interview we did had too much background noise. When I told him about it on Twitter, he told me to call him and do a phone interview. Yesterday we had a 20 minute conversation discussing his career. Unfortunately (again) the app I used on my phone to record the conversation only recorded me talking. EPIC FAIL. Clearly I do not have future in journalism. Thankfully, I have a decent memory, and wrote down most of the things we talked about. -Mike B._

In case you have been living under a rock, Mike Jenkins is an American Strongman Corporation professional strongman sponsored by [Rogue][1] and Maximum Human Performance ([MHP][2]). In case of you have never tried MHP’s Dark Matter, do yourself a favor; it’s pretty awesome (MHP has the best supplement names ever).

For those of you that don’t know, even as a sponsored professional strongman, it is difficult to make ends meet just doing strongman. Although Mike has won the Arnold Strongman Classic with a $50,000 prize, not every contest has a purse that high. For his day job, Mike is a recreation leader at Milton Hershey School in Hershey, Pennsylvania. This is not a typical school however. [Milton Hershey School][3] is a private school that focuses on the individual growth of the student more so than a traditional school. The students at the school have different social and financial needs than traditional schools, and talking to Mike about it, he clearly has a passion for his work. The kids also love the fact that Mike competes in strongman, and love watching him compete.

Additionally, Mike works with a few younger, local football players, because he feels that some of the football strength programs are a bit out of touch with the times. He also emphasized that not all of these coaches are enthused about the help he gives these players, which to me is just crazy. Just looking at Mike and what he has accomplished, why wouldn’t you want him to help your players get stronger?

Prior to picking up strongman in 2007, Mike played 12 years of high school, collegiate, and professional football. When I asked why he stopped playing, he gave the answer I have heard many times, and it was that he lost love for the game. Thankfully for us, in 2007 Mike picked up a pair of farmer’s walk implements that his friend had, and entered his first contest shortly thereafter. Also in 2007, he went to North American Strongman Nationals and placed sixth. In 2009, Mike would place second in that same contest. In 2010 however, is where Mike truly took the strongman world by storm.

The Arnold Amateur Strongman World Championships were first held in 2010, and the winner received a pro card. In 2010 that winner was none other than Mike Jenkins. Not only did he receive a pro card, he was invited back in 2011 to compete with the big boys (literally) at the Arnold Strongman Classic (ASC). While the World’s Strongest Man (WSM) title might be the title that the average person has heard of, strongman enthusiasts know that the Arnold Strongman Classic is the heaviest contest, and carries prestige nearly equal to WSM. Mike pointed out that because the ASC is such a heavy event, there are rarely repeat winners (aside from six time champ Zydrunas Savickas). In 2011 Mike made his professional debut at the ASC, and finished in second place behind Brian Shaw. More impressive than that however, was that he came out ahead of Big Z, who placed a disappointing third. How many people can say in their debut pro strongman contest they upset Big Z?

In 2012 Mike would go on to win the ASC ahead of fellow American Derek Poundstone, and 2011 winner Brian Shaw (who suffered a torn biceps). I was fortunate enough to be sitting in the center row of that contest as I watched this:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EgcZjMxves?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

After other athletes failed to press the log, Mike comes out and presses it TWICE. And this log weighs 460 pounds. It was quite a sight to see, especially since Big Z, arguably the greatest strongman ever, only pressed it once.

In addition to a 2nd place finish at the ASC 2011, and a 1st place finish in the ASC 2012, Mike has also competed in two WSM finals. In the 2011 WSM Mike finished in 8th, and in 2012 he finished in 5th. When I asked if he thought he could one day be a WSM title holder, the answer was a resounding yes.

Unfortunately, as we all know, strongman can be hard on the body. Going into WSM 2012 Mike had some pain in his left knee, but didn’t think much of it other than it was a minor issue. Unfortunately, during his narrow miss to match Big Z on the 220k log press he heard a “crunch” in his left knee. After returning home from California, Mike spent a few months trying to rehab it himself, and even received shots that made it feel temporarily better. However, nothing was really working to allow him to train at 100%. In December, Mike made the decision that he needed to have surgery. Mike said that although in the short term he had to withdraw from the ASC 2013, it was his career and even more so, his long term physical abilities that needed to worry about. Since then Mike has made significant progress, and plans to be ready in September for WSM 2013. He has resumed squatting and deadlifting, and is quickly getting back to where he needs to be.

When I talked to Mike about his strengths and weaknesses in the gym, he was quick to identify them. I figured Mike would say his world class pressing ability was his strength, but he said he felt moving events were his best. I can’t really argue with that though, the guy can seriously move with a yoke. As far as weaknesses, Mike says he needs to bring his deadlift up. Moving forward, he is going to be working with Brandon Lilly from [Juggernaut Training Systems][4] or Jesse Burdick from Powerwod.com/Supertraining (<http://powerwod.com>/) in his pursuit of a bigger pull. Mike has actually been working with Jesse for the past few months on his diet, and has dropped from 400lbs to about 350lbs. Note: Mike routinely posts pictures of empty Ben & Jerry’s ice cream containers on Twitter, and keeps losing weight. We need to redefine “superfood”. Something else that was interesting is that this will be the first time Mike has ever worked with a coach for strongman. He has taught himself to be a strongman through trial-and-error. He did however mention this is not an approach that will work for everyone. Mike said that if you have the opportunity to learn from anyone that has competed in strongman, at least listen to what they have to say.

When I asked Mike about his long term future in strongman, he didn’t give me a definitive answer. He knows for now that he wants to get his knee back to 100%, and get back to WSM. We briefly discussed the longevity of athletes in the sport, and he pointed out how heavy the weights have gotten over the years. In January, Mike wrote [this article][5] for JTS strength highlighting how the log press records have been utterly annihilated over the past 15 years. The fact is, the weights keep getting heavier, and this is going to be a factor in how long strongmen are in the game. How many ASC and WSM competitions can a person’s body really handle?

I’m extremely thankful that Mike took time to let me interview him not once, but twice in the past week. Mike has already accomplished quite a bit in his career, and doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. I for one would love to see him press a 500lb log, maybe even before Big Z. Let’s hope he has a fast recovery and once again makes a trip to WSM. Who knows, maybe he could be standing on the podium in six short months…
