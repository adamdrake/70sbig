This week in 70sBigVille, we discussed how, like it or not, CrossFit is impacting the strength world in big ways. Not only are there a million more ladies wearing Lulu tights, <a title="Click here, get gainz" href="/blog/2013/03/some-truths-about-crossfit-and-weightlifting/" target="_blank">there&#8217;s also a huge spike in the interest of weightlifting as a sport</a>. Tsypkin wrote up a good post, then trolled a bit imo, and a good time was had by all. Or most, at least. Maybe. Continue arguing below if you think that&#8217;s a productive use of your time (vs. more curls).

On Wednesday, Mike B wrote up an <a title="Click here if you want to live" href="/blog/2013/03/interview-with-mike-jenkins/" target="_blank">interview with Mike Jenkins</a>, large human and competitive Strongman. Strongman as a sport represents a lot of what 70sBig is all about &#8211; moving around heavy things and having fun doing it. Mention your latest feats of strength in the comments. I&#8217;ll be at a SM contest in San Antonio tomorrow cheering on some brothers. If you know of any events in the near future, mention those, too, and I&#8217;ll award you multiple bonus points. These interviews are getting a good reception, so I hope you&#8217;re ready for next week &#8211; Tsypkin scored a discussion withÂ <a title="Niko is Awesome" href="http://www.garageinkpowerteam.com/Garage-Ink-Lifters.html" target="_blank">Niko</a>. Boom.

A few weeks ago, we had a 2-part series of Articles by Bert and Marijke (<a title="Part 1" href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-one/" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, <a title="Part 2" href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-two/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>). Bert was kind enough to send me an update, because they&#8217;ve both competed again since then. How many times have you competed this year?

> Hey Jacob, Thought I&#8217;d keep you informed.
> 
> Last Saturday Marijke and I competed again and she did 72,5 (2,5KG PR) &#8211; 35 (matched previous meet PR) &#8211; 80 (10 kg PR).
> 
> Right after the first Platform was done, a judge DEMANDED that she tried extra-wide sumo and she pulled 90kgs x 2 (so a 20 kg deadlift PR in a month!)
> 
> Here&#8217;s the compilation of our lifts. Her training changed slightly and she also lost 2 kilograms between last contest (2nd of February) and this one (2nd of March), weighing 53,3kgs last Saturday.
> 
> Kind regards and lots of courage for your lady friend and her training as well!

THIS.IS.AWESOME! I love this stuff. Guys and gals, please keep sending me updates like this. I love it. Also, if anyone wants to come yell at me in foreign languages, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;ll add 50 pounds to my total. Thanks ahead of time.

If you haven&#8217;t yet, check out the forums at <a title="#WINNING" href="http://liftheavyshit.com/forum/" target="_blank">LiftHeavyShit.com</a>. I started it with a buddy of mine after a long night of drinking (and some lifting) and it has evolved into a not-terrible place to keep your log and/or stalk Patrick Stroup&#8217;s every lift/meal/BM. We have competitive CrossFitters, Strongmen, PLers, and weightlifters from all around the world keeping their logs and there and posting mirror pics after bench/chins supersets, and not a whole lot of shits are given, nor jimmies russled. Enjoy.
