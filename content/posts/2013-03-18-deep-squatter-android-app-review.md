_We received a message from Developer Johan of [Jumisapps][1] about a new Android app he developed called Deep Squatter. This app measures your squat depth through the angle of your leg, and gives you feedback at the end of your set (unless [It&#8217;s still your MF&#8217;ing set][2], then I guess you won&#8217;t see it.) Our unofficial official 70&#8217;s Big app tester Paul Sousa put it though it&#8217;s paces last week and weighs in here:_

  Forget politics or religion, the most divisive subject on the planet is squat depth.  Well, if you own an Android smartphone you can now have proof of your depth to shove in the faces of all your Youtube critics.  Developer Jumisapps has released an app named Deep Squatter that aims to let you know if you truly are a deep squatter, or if you’re more like Marotta at the Arnold (too soon?).
</p>

The concept behind it is simple, in the app you set your desired reps and the depth you want to reach in degrees with 90 degrees being parallel.  You can also set whether you want to have a beep or vibration when you hit your desired depth on each rep (I had both turned on and could barely notice the vibration, and couldn’t hear the sound at all).  Once you begin squatting the app tracks your reps and depth, and upon completion of your set it will show how many reps you completed and the depth.

  It would be nice to be able to see specific info for each rep though, instead of what seems to be either just the info from the last rep or an overall average (not sure which it is).  There is also a rumor that the developer will be adding the ability to track speed which could prove very useful, especially to those who use dynamic work in their programs.
</p>

Overall I think it’s a cool concept executed pretty well.  Some minor enhancements to allow for more detailed information would go a long way, but even as is I would recommend it for anyone who is curious about their depth.
