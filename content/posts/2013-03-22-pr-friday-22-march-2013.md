It&#8217;s Friday! This week on the site Paul Sousa [reviewed a new android app called deep squatter][1]. On Tuesday we had SOF Olpainless reflect on[ his experiences with training while deployed][2], and then on Thursday Darth Tsypkin [answered more of your questions][3]

Going forward, [Mike Battaglino][4] will be answering reader submitted questions on topics such as Powerlifting, Strongman, Military related training, declining spots, etc. in a video format. Questions can be submitted to mike@70sbig.com or posted in the comments on facebook. Mike answered a few questions already, posted on our facebook page this week:

**Michael asks:**  **<span style="font-size: 14px">I&#8217;m a Marine and I love powerlifting (just competed in my first meet) but I need to temporarily focus on dropping my 3 mile run time for a PFT. What are your suggestions for strength maintenance while I start running long enough to do well on the fitness test? I&#8217;m planning on throwing together a mix of interval/tempo work and the occasional longer run (2-3 miles). Probably 3-4 days a week of running. I&#8217;m sure this is a pretty common scenario for the military folk.</span>**

<span style="font-size: 14px">Mike: I&#8217;m quite glad my PT test days are over. I would reccomend trying to maintain your current program the best that you can, and just keep the weights the same for 4-6 weeks. If you need to, drop some of the accessory lifts. You shouldn&#8217;t lose a tremendous amount of strength, and you can be back to adding weight 1-2 weeks after the test. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14px">I wouldn&#8217;t worry about moving the weights up for either your volume or intensity days. Perhaps for your bench and press you can move up slowly, but I would just worry about passing the test, and maintaining your current numbers.</span>

**Kyp asks: <span style="font-size: 14px"> I recently bought a yoke and it&#8217;s supposed to be arriving sometime this week so figure I would study up on it in the mean time. I was wondering if you would be able to share any knowledge/know of any particularly good sources or information regarding programming yoke walks for somebody trying to get 70&#8217;s big, and have a good base of general conditioning?</span>**

Mike: Kyp, I have read a quite a few pro strongman training logs, and everyone seems to program it a bit differently. I&#8217;ve only had my yoke for about six months, but I would recommend keeping it light for a little while. If you could manage to do it once a week, you would probably develop your technique pretty quickly, but keep it relatively light. Once it starts to get heavy, do it every other week. If you&#8217;re going into a contest where you&#8217;re going to use the yoke, consider programming speed/heavy days with it. I think the most important thing is to develop skill walking with it. Watch videos of pro strongman using it and experiment with what works for you (particularly hand placement).
