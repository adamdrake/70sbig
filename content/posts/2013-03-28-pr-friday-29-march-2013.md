Look, I get it. I&#8217;m &#8220;that guy.&#8221; It&#8217;s fine. I wear obnoxious tank tops in public. My beard scares strangers. I challenge crossing guards to front-double-bi-pose-downs. I trap slap my &#8220;friends&#8221; until they have bruises.

I wear short shorts, and I yell &#8220;TEARDROP!&#8221; at awkward moments in romantic comedies.

I completely deny having ever gone to a single romantic comedy.

I&#8217;m not going to apologize for having fun, especially while lifting things up and putting them down. And neither should you. Next time you go to the gym, recreate this scene during your warmups. You&#8217;ll be a better man/woman for it:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0qPmGMfMdWA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

And if not, well, hopefully you don&#8217;t get kicked out.

This week, Aaron wrote <a href="/blog/2013/03/70s-big-attitude-2/" target="_blank">another article</a> that I personally thought was fan-fucking-tastic. Some people probably didn&#8217;t think so. Those people aren&#8217;t having enough fun. The point of this site is to help each other get stronger, leaner, meaner, and more awesomer, just like our long lost brothers did back in the 70s. Think they apologized? Nope.

This site has become an awesome community, and continues to evolve into something bigger than Justin or any of us ever imagined when it was launched. We get more daily hits than ever before, and our sphere of influence continues to grow. Hell, big ol&#8217; Mark Bell even mentioned us this week on his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDv-C3Xtb2A" target="_blank">youtubes</a>Â (if you don&#8217;t follow his selfie-vids, do it now &#8211; he&#8217;s full of great info and stupid hats). Take pride in being a part of this group, and make sure you comment here, especially on PR Fridays like today. Stop lurking, and start contributing. If you&#8217;d like to keep a workout log or ask questions, you can join the <a title="Go here and register. " href="http://liftheavyshit.com/forum/" target="_blank">LiftHeavyShit</a> forums (NWS, duh), or hit us up on facebook. Tsypkin answers questions every Thursday, mostly about CrossFit and Olympic Weightlifting. This week, <a href="/mike/" target="_blank">Mike</a> took a huge chunk of time to answer every question he could find on the facebooks in this video:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6DR756jVn5A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

(thanks to user cwhite for making a [table of contents][1] in the comments section!)

We might all be jackasses, but we&#8217;re here for you. Keep the questions, comments, and PRs rolling in!
