Haaaaaaaaave you seen our posts this week? Monday we had <a href="/blog/2013/04/guest-post-jackie-and-the-platform/" target="_blank">a guest post by Jackie</a>. She seems pretty cool. Cooler than anyone else who hasn&#8217;t <a title="Submit more articles, please. " href="/submissions/" target="_blank">submitted</a> an article about grabbing life by the balls, competing even when nervous, and kicking ass, at least. She added me as a friend on the old <a title="Add me if you want to stalk me. " href="https://www.facebook.com/jacobcloud" target="_blank">facebooks</a>, and now I see that she&#8217;s competing AGAIN this weekend at USAW University Nationals in Tennessee, so let&#8217;s wish her well and hope for an updated post from her in the near future. Anyone else competing? Seek and Destroy, friends.

On Wednesday, Brian had an <a href="/blog/2013/04/carlos-interview/" target="_blank">in-depth interview with powerlifter Carlos</a>. Brian is a quiet but valuable part of the team behind the scenes here at 70sBig. He makes sure our social media junk is up to date and every once in awhile, photoshops ridiculous pictures of everyone but me. He showed off his writing chops in this interview, and I think it was pretty damn good. It&#8217;s long, but worth the read. You guys really seem to enjoy these interviews, so we have a few more coming. Tsypkin is still working on a 2 or 3 part series of interviews with Niko Hulslander, so hopefully that will be ready to publish in the next week or two. I am also working with <a title="AC's log, no homo" href="/ac/" target="_blank">AC</a> on a whole slew of upcoming articles that don&#8217;t include pictures of his butt. Or do they?

Tsypkin didn&#8217;t receive enough questions this week to warrant a Q&A, but Mike scoured the internet (facebook and the comments sections of the posts) and made another very helpful video. Watch it, tell your kids and doctor to watch it, and enjoy. Keep asking questions on the facebook page. Apparently these guys like it.

Now, I have some homework for you guys and gals. Some of you (most?) are relatively new to our humble section of the internet (just kidding, we&#8217;re not humble, we&#8217;re fucking awesome). It&#8217;s time for a flash-back. Read this post:

</blog/2010/08/the-70s-big-face/>

Homework Part 1: Give us your favorite quote out of that article. Mine: &#8220;Fucking Brent.&#8221; It just makes me laugh, what can I say? Fucking Brent.

Homework Part 2: Take a pic. Send it to submissions@70sbig.com with the title &#8220;This is my 70sbig Face&#8221; or something funny. I will take the best ones and put them on the site.

I thought of this a couple weeks ago when I was supporting a couple of my lifters at the NAS Texas Strongest Man contest and saw <a title="Click to support Ryan's quest to WORLDS!" href="/blog/2013/02/ryan-carrillo-is-70sbig/" target="_blank">our buddy Ryan Carrillo</a> . He aimed his Canon and 17-40L in my direction, and without really thinking, here&#8217;s what happened:

Last week, <a title="Last Friday's PR post. Have you gotten stronger since then?" href="/blog/2013/03/pr-friday-29-march-2013/" target="_blank">I talked about the lifestyle we choose to live</a>. We lift heavy things and we have a damn good time doing it. This face helps show the world just how ridiculously awesome we are, so send me your best shots, and I&#8217;ll post them up. (Make sure they are less than 1MB each, please. Do you know how much a MB of storage costs in the 70s? Prolly about a hundred.)

To get us started on PRs, our buddy Brooks Conway, a notable young 181lb IPF equipped lifter, sent in this video of a recent 600&#215;1 Raw Deadlift.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-Q2GxUCZqQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

CrossFitters take note: He pulls 600 raw, with some bumpers&#8230;and doesn&#8217;t DROP it. K? He also recently <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ6N0jZCgWs" target="_blank">raw squatted 495&#215;3</a>, which happens to tie what one of my 181&#8217;s is squatting this Saturday, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8--SZ808H0o" target="_blank">benches 365 for raw doubles</a>, so&#8230;everyone, get stronger. The bar is high around here. Even if you aren&#8217;t there yet, get stronger every week, and keep us in the loop! Post your PRs, do your homework, take your vitamins, and have a stellar weekend.
