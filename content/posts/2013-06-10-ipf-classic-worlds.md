The IPF is hosting the &#8220;first&#8221; annual IPF World Classic Championship this week in Russia. I use the term &#8220;first&#8221; a bit loosely, because they had a nearly identical raw contest last year, but slightly changed the name this year (primarily because this year, they are hosting Junior and Sub-Junior Raw classes as well as Open).

Here&#8217;s where you can watch it live (scroll down for the schedule &#8211; keep in mind that they are 9 hours ahead of the Central Time Zone, 8 hours ahead of EST, etc.): <http://goodlift.info/live.php>

Here&#8217;s the lifter start list: <http://goodlift.info/onenomination.php?cid=260>

Here&#8217;s where you can check out the IPF Classic World Records/Standards, MANY of which will be broken this week: <http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/44.html>

Some (American) Men&#8217;s lifters of note (I&#8217;ll make another post about the ladies):

Eric Kupperstein (59kg) and Shawn Frasquillo (66kg) lift Tuesday at 5pm (in Russian time &#8211; subtract the proper # of hours for your time zone). Eric&#8217;s been lifting for about 200 years, including last year at the IPF Classic Cup, and has pulled over 550lbs at 123lbs bodyweight, and 578 at 132. Shawn&#8217;s a local central-Texas fella who looks about a week out from a bodybuilding show at any point, and holds the US record with a 341lb bench in the 148 class, and 363 as a light 165.

For some reason, we don&#8217;t have any entries in the 74 or 83kg Open classes, but LS McClain (another Texan) will put on a great show as a 93kg. You might have seen him win Raw Nationals last year, and if you did, you&#8217;ll remember his bench &#8211; he hit 201kg/443lbs as a 198 &#8211; with a pretty close grip and a minimal arch. He&#8217;s a beast. The man he edged out at Raw Nats has a familiar name, and will be competing in the 93kg Junior class &#8211; Ian Bell. He will absolutely destroy the Jr. World Standard in the deadlift &#8211; probably on his second attempt. He&#8217;s got a great chance of bringing another Gold back to Austin. Ian lifts Thursday at 10am, and LS lifts on Friday at 12:30pm (remember, that&#8217;s Russian time).

Robert Trettin is a strong young guy that I saw at Raw Nats, but haven&#8217;t met. He&#8217;ll be in an extremely tough 105kg field, led by Russian Alex-Edward Raus, whose 325kg squat is a thing of beauty. They&#8217;ll be lifting Saturday at 1pm.

Everyone knows Mike T. He had a very tough IPF Classics last year (to say the least &#8211; <a href="/blog/2012/06/2012-ipf-raw-worlds/" target="_blank">read my coverage here</a>), and we&#8217;re all hoping he can come out this year and take the gold, though he&#8217;s coming in ranked second to a Russian monster. There&#8217;s also another American in the class, Michael Hedlesky, who I haven&#8217;t heard of, but has very respectable numbers, including a 350kg deadlift. They lift Sunday at 11am, along with the SHW lifters &#8211; notably, Brad Gillingham. Brad is an all-time great, and comes in as the heavy favorite to win (and to demolish the WR DL, naturally). Getting up Sunday morning to watch these two classes is going to be worth it!

Take a good look at the American representation in the Junior classes &#8211; I&#8217;m not familiar with most of them, but I&#8217;m sure I will be soon, and so will you. The future of powerlifting in the US &#8211; especially raw &#8211; is pretty stellar. Guys like Gregory Johnson (who I&#8217;ve seen at pretty much every local TX meet, and has pulled 727.5 as a 220) are a lot of fun to watch and have just begun reaching their potential.
