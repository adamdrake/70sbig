_Don&#8217;t forget that it&#8217;s PR Friday. Give us your weekly updates and PR&#8217;s. _

Ladies! Gentlemen! Friends!

In <a href="/blog/2013/02/a-quick-note/" target="_blank">February</a> I dropped a note that explaining how I accepted a position that would limit my involvement with the site for a while. Jacob Cloud has done a wonderful job putting interesting material up in my stead. This site won&#8217;t ever die, but hypothetically there could be lulls in my direct involvement.

All that being said, I have a bit of time to spare and will be contributing again! To the long-time regulars: hello again you curmudgeonly Todds. To the new users that have logged on in the past few months: salutations and welcome to this wonderful community.

**In addition to your normal PR Friday updates, I&#8217;m interested in hearing from the 70&#8217;s Big community on three topics: **

1) How has your training been through the first half of 2013? What are you excelling at? What are your deficiencies? Have you hit any of your 2013 goals yet?

2) What is the most significant thing you&#8217;ve learned about training so far this year?

3) What is the most momentous piece of news from the strength and conditioning world in 2013 (to include powerlifting, weightlifting, strongman, and related competitions or sports)?

I hope that 70&#8217;s Big not only <a href="/blog/2012/08/vegetarians-are-great/" target="_blank">entertains you</a>, but also inspires you to <a href="/blog/2012/01/antagonistic-motivation/" target="_blank">train your dick off</a> and <a href="/blog/2012/10/play-the-hand-youre-dealt/" target="_blank">not let your weakness consume you</a>. So let&#8217;s dance.
