The Pan Am Championships take place this week in Isla Margarita, Venezuela. Jon North and Jared Fleming are both competing, and have been hitting big lifts lately in the gym during preparation. Donovan Ford has also being putting up some big lifts, I think you&#8217;ll be seeing his name a lot more often as the US 105kg lifter.
