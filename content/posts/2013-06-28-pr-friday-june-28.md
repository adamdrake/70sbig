Another week in the books here at 70&#8217;s Big. Justin&#8217;s been in and out this week, but if you&#8217;re just checking in today, Chris is [hosting a strength workshop tomorrow in Longmont, CO][1]. Also, [the Pan American Weightlifting Championships are wrapping up tomorrow][2], Travis Cooper already brought home the bronze medal in the 85kg class yesterday, Congrats to Travis! Jon North and Jared Fleming will be lifting around 2:30pm EST today, good luck to those guys.

Also, Mike checks in with us while frying up some fish, with what&#8217;s on his mind:

[AC][3] & Company are working on some tank top designs just in time for the peak of summer, we&#8217;ll keep you guys posted on when those will be available.

As usual, let us know how you&#8217;re doing in the comments today. How&#8217;s training going? Make any PR&#8217;s? Justin will be checking in when he gets some free time to answer any questions you may have for him, so leave those as well.
