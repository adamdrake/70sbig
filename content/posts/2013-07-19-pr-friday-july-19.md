  It&#8217;s been a quiet few weeks here while Justin settles into a rhythm, but here at 70&#8217;s Big, we believe in quality over quantity. If you missed last week&#8217;s post, Justin continued his series on manliness with <a href="/blog/2013/07/10/">Take Back The Tank Top</a>, a manifesto on obligatory summer attire. This week, <a href="/blog/2013/07/17/">Marotta sent in a mob</a> that he thought might help some people, and <a href="/blog/2013/07/18/">Mike reviewed</a> Kelly Starrett&#8217;s new book.

  In other news, Klokov continues to post videos at a reckless pace, including this gem with commentary:

  Notable comment of the week goes to mattalbright, in reference to Mike&#8217;s joke about leg presses.

      If you feel like leg pressing after squats, squat more, then reconsider. Keep squatting until leg pressing would seem silly.

    Welp, that&#8217;s all I got. If you guys have any questions about training, spots, or whatever else for Mike or Justin, post them here in the comments. They are kinda like 7-11: not always doing business, but always open. cya
