Glenn Pendlay recently posted an article on <a href="http://glennpendlay.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">his blog</a> explaining how he trains the Muscle Driver USA Olympic weightlifting team (<a href="http://glennpendlay.wordpress.com/2013/07/21/how-we-train/" target="_blank">article</a>).

It&#8217;s your standard fare of doing the competitive lifts, doing power and other variants when necessary, and getting stronger with presses and squats. There are some peculiarities that help distribute the work load throughout the week, like making the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon workouts the heaviest days, doing doubles and power variants in the morning sessions, and always trying to improve the squat.

Pendlay also mentions using the Texas Method to push the squats. For those of you who never read my <a href="/books/" target="_blank">Texas Method e-books</a>, the style of programming was coined when the Wichita Falls Weightlifting team fell into it with Pendlay as the head coach. It&#8217;s a good general approach that can push an Olympic weightlifter&#8217;s squat without interfering too much with the competitive lifts&#8217; training. The way I program the Texas Method is more for general strength trainees and raw powerlifting, but a weightlifter will have success with the core program of using a volume day, light day, and intensity day.

Anyway, check out Glenn&#8217;s article; his system is a simple outline that he dials in for specific lifters depending on what they need, whether their weaknesses are in squatting, overhead strength, cleaning, snatching, or jerking.
