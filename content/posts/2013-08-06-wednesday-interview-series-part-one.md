Today you are presented an interview with Callahan, or dubbed by Mike, &#8220;Sting&#8221;. For clarification/social purposes he is not to be confused with the real [Sting][1]. Callahan seems to be a fan favorite amongst several of the readers. He often sneaks in videos and makes an appearance spotting. He has helped many, including myself (A.C.), reach numerous goals in strength training and competitive powerlifting. Callahan has also trained alongside several world class athletes, but he doesn&#8217;t just teach you about sports he teaches you about life! Over the years I have known him he has been a consistent influence to those around him. Always encouraging and willing to help. Once you see past the intimidating exterior you see more than just a swole stuck-in-the-80&#8217;s Metal-Head.
