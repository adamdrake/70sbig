Here is the second installment of our Wednesday Interview Series with Callahan. In case you missed the first video you can catch it [here][1]. This video gives you a small taste of what Callahan does for accessory arm work. The next video will highlight some of his heavy barbell training which is done at Marietta Barbell. It&#8217;s the home of some serious lifters. He is certainly in full form when he trains heavy. Don&#8217;t miss it!

Also, check out this Smashing Pumpkins music video. See if you can find Callahan in it. This is sort of like &#8220;Where&#8217;s Waldo?&#8221;, but with a 5&#8217;10 gorilla that sticks out like a sore thumb.
