Training consistently is a learning process, an active process of introspection. Getting stronger isn&#8217;t easy. It requires a laboring, painful work that will only be expressed in the next bout of laboring, painful work. Yet with strength training, that process is just as important as the end. Choosing to do something hard &#8212; of your own volition &#8212; puts the mind in a vulnerable state. It forces you to decide whether or not you think you&#8217;re capable. Want to complete a set, but don&#8217;t think you can? You won&#8217;t. Staring down the bar, daring it to beat you and _knowing_ that you will crush it; that is something entirely different, my friends.

It isn&#8217;t about merely attempting something that is Very. Fucking. Hard. But shifting the mindset into not just the possibility of completion, but the explosive dominance and subsequent victory you&#8217;ll have over that barrier. The mindset itself is the victory. The destruction of the set is the victory lap. The weening moments after when your heart is still racing and short of breath &#8212; that&#8217;s standing on the podium. Learning how to give everything you have mentally and physically to achieve your goals is what getting stronger is all about.

Happy PR Friday.
