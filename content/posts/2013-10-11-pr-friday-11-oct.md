I am here.

2013 has been busy. Some of you regular readers may be wondering, &#8220;What the PISS is going on?&#8221; I&#8217;ve just been busy with a job that doesn&#8217;t leave a lot of free time. That being said, I&#8217;ve got some things planned for 70&#8217;s Big.

First, posts will pick back up a little bit. I&#8217;ve got at least seven topics to write about right now, and plenty of stuff I&#8217;ve been mulling over. The goal is to get two posts up a week. I&#8217;ll admit it&#8217;s hard to get topics up with a hectic schedule, but it is my doody. Ahem; duty.

Second, I&#8217;m putting together the logistics to start doing a regular podcast again. Mike and I will be doing it, and it&#8217;ll function similar to the Paleo Solution podcast with a main topic of the day followed by a reader submitted Q&A. The availability of the show will depend on scheduling, but I at least want it to be every other week with the hope of doing it every week. You can listen to past shows with the old show format by searching &#8220;70&#8217;s Big Radio&#8221; on iTunes.

Third, I&#8217;m working on some ways that will allow our community to interact and mingle a bit better. The best part about 70&#8217;s Big is that it&#8217;s fun getting to chat with other lifters, male or female, and talk about this big part of our lives that &#8216;normal people&#8217; just don&#8217;t understand.

Fourth, 70&#8217;s Big is still open for content submissions. If you have images or links to share, just throw them up on the <a href="www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a> and we&#8217;ll re-post them for everyone to see.

My goal is to teach readers about training, lifting mechanics, anatomy, physiology, programming, nutrition, recovery, mobility, performance enhancement, and so on while providing a dash of entertainment. Expect to see a little _push_ out of 70&#8217;s Big as the year winds down, and hopefully we&#8217;ll have some fun along the way.

And we need this education. Look at this stupid-ass product that Sorinex is selling from their website. It&#8217;s a back extension bench with a swiss ball on it. For 1,000 doll hairs. (_Pictured below to avoid giving the company hits on their site._)
