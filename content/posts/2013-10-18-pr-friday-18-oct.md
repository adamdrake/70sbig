**Quick Tip #1**
  
_Lots of ideas and little time means you will get a quick tip with each PR Friday post._ 

**Consider adding an agility work into your program**, especially if you aren&#8217;t signed up for any competitions or meets. Since you aren&#8217;t locked into peaking for an event, you can afford to add training to develop non-strength physical attributes.

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT </a>we define fitness as strength, mobility, and endurance (this is also the foundation for performance). Navigating your body through space is an element of mobility, and it shouldn&#8217;t be ignored. The easiest way to throw it in is part of your warm-up. Add some tuck jumps, carioca, side shuffles, and power skips into your warm-up and you&#8217;ll get a little dose of explosiveness and lateral movement. Will it turn you into an athlete? No. Will it help make you a bit more athletic if you&#8217;re a goon? Yeah. More importantly it will let your joints and structures in the legs adapt to some non-lifting and non-linear activity. Joints that are able to withstand explosive forces are less prone to injury, something that will be a key in longevity (more on this next week). The basic movements above are not invasive, easy to do, and don&#8217;t take a lot of time if you do a few sets of each. If you don&#8217;t have great joint mobility (range of motion), then use movement prep instead of agility work to help rehab your body.

Ladder work is another great agility tool.
