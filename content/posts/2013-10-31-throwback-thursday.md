Hope everyone&#8217;s week is going well. There&#8217;s a wealth of information that&#8217;s been posted here on the site in past years, so I thought it might be good to highlight some of the finer articles from the past. Some of these posts are very informative, while others are both humorous and informative. Here&#8217;s a video that falls into the latter category from a few years ago, Gant shows us how to properly load your bowl at a Mongolian BBQ restaurant.
