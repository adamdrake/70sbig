Last year Justin called the 70&#8217;s Big community to action to help raise
  
funds to realize the vision of my short film, The Artist & The
  
Olympian, which stars Donny Shankle.

Thanks to you guys for submitting all of those doll hairs, The Artist
  
& The Olympian raised the money it needed to and as of this morning it
  
is available for your viewing pleasure for FREE @
  
<a href="http://www.theartistandtheolympian.com/" target="_blank">http://www.theartistandtheolympian.com/</a>  &#8230;AND YOU MUST WATCH!

Here is why you need to watch, share, post, tweet, and comment about
  
this film everywhere you can, because it could be turned into a
  
feature film! The first to use a Weightlifter as a main character in a
  
dramatic story line.  A film that would realistically portray the
  
American Weightlifting world we live in and shed a spotlight on the
  
entire strength sports as a whole!

In order for this to happen, people need to watch this film, A LOT,
  
like over a million times.  Why? So that it gains the attention of
  
investors and big name actors to want to put their name and money in
  
the project. With over 10,000 views on this page per day, 70&#8217;s Big
  
could be a huge catalyst for this to happen and I believe it can
  
happen with your support.  After all, this is what we&#8217;ve wanted
  
forever, right!?  For someone to finally come along and bring our
  
world and everything we love about it to the greater public!?  If
  
you’ve ever heard anyone bitch about how nobody does anything to
  
improve weightlifting in the U.S., then show them this page.

Lastly, you should watch it because it&#8217;s awesome and SHANKLE.
