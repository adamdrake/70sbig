PR Friday &#8212; Post training updates, PR&#8217;s, and what you are going to do to become more of a man in the comments (read this post first).

**Quick Tip #3 &#8212; Be A God Damn Man**

Look, I know the website has been in anaphylaxis. Shit ain&#8217;t the same, right? Well that&#8217;s fucking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4psKYpfnYs" target="_blank">BULLSHIT</a>. We need some adrenaline injected into our veins. We needed to be reminded of why we&#8217;re here. I&#8217;m loaded up on copious amounts of coffee and am listening to heavy metal. No, not the pussy-ass new-age shit like Disturbed that predicates itself on being angry at their mom for catching them wanking into their favorite tube sock. I&#8217;m talking about Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, possibly some **Mötley Crüe**. Grit, attitude, and uppercuts.

You know, the qualities that make a god damn Man. But what is a man?

_What makes a man, is it the power in his hands?_
  
_Is it his quest for glory?_
  
_Give it all you&#8217;ve got, to fight to the top,_
  
_So we can know your story.

A man _fights for glory._ He&#8217;s doing everything he can to beat the FUCKING SHIT out of every day to meet his goals, to be successful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPVLyB0Yc6I" target="_blank">A wiser feller than myself once said</a>, &#8220;Sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes the bar eats you.&#8221; That means some days you&#8217;ll get elbow dropped from the top rope. But a man &#8212; a true hairy-chested sexual Tyrannosaurus &#8212; will wipe the blood and shame off his brow, get up, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asHnD75LG5E" target="_blank">shake the top rope</a> like an asshole, and <a href="http://youtu.be/7tfyLbin9gs" target="_blank">get in the ring</a> one more time. That&#8217;s what a man is.

Why is it so important to be a man? Aside from the intuitive notion that being a man is just, true, and innate, it&#8217;s the desire for success that makes it important. Life is a wonderfully beautiful thing; to sit idle like the oily surface of a swamp is a crime. Criminal is the man who doesn&#8217;t who doesn&#8217;t constantly strive for success, who doesn&#8217;t crave experience, and who doesn&#8217;t want it all. Criminal are the timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.

Are you on the path to getting whatever the hell it is that you want? If you could be doing more, then you need to slam your fist down onto a hard wood table, lift the table up to the heavens, and then break it in half over your head. Take these lumber pieces and light them on fire. Breathe the smoke before screaming as loud as you can. This will increase your testosterone levels by 37% and immediately make you more attractive to the opposite sex (women love the smell of &#8220;outside&#8221;).

Now get on track. What do you want to be? Need to be? What challenges sit between you and manliness? I understand some of you can&#8217;t just quit your job or family to try and choke slam your truest desire; that&#8217;s why 70&#8217;s Big is here for you. Because at the very least you can step into a weight room, load the bar, and move some god damn iron. Getting stronger requires commitment and desire. It&#8217;s never-ending; you can&#8217;t be &#8220;too strong&#8221;. It teaches the mentality that meeting your goals is hard, grinding work, but you can face each step with an animalistic intensity. You know that _attacking_ the bar is more successful than just trying to move it. Your mindset before each session, set, and repetition is going to dictate how badly you destroy it. The same concept applies to life; attack your non-lifting goals with the same berserking intensity and you&#8217;ll have a hard time failing.

Have you been lifting in the gym for a year? Sign up for a meet and put your ass on the line. Bored with your job? Fucking _do_ something about it. Be innovative, create your own job, make your company better, or say, &#8220;Fuck it,&#8221; and do something else.

Everybody has something locked away in their mind that they wish they would have done or wish they had the balls to try. Go and do it. Explore the world, compete, and challenge yourself. If life takes a fat shit on you (as it often does), wipe it off, get back up, and keep striding forward. Be a god damn man.
