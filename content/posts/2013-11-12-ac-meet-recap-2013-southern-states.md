_I hope that reading about AC&#8217;s experience will inspire you to enter a local competition. Have fun and train hard. &#8211;Justin_

I recently competed in the 2013 Georgia and Southern States Powerlifting Championships hosted by Josh Rohr and held at Meadow Creek High-school.

Started off the day well. Got roughly 7 hours of sleep the night before, which was a lot considering I was really nervous/anxious. It&#8217;s only inevitable to get some pre-game jitters. Everybody knows them well. You think about the excitement during the day of the meet. You feel that don&#8217;t you&#8230;that tingling in your balls? Big metal butterflies fluttering around your stomach? No it&#8217;s not testicular cancer; that&#8217;s your mind fucking you. Hope you&#8217;re wearing a condom.

Fortunately I slept well. Woke up around 6. Made my way to the meet. Checked in/Rack Heights/Equipment check. All done. I get to the scale. The guy looks at me and says 101.7. I stare blankly at him and say words Chris has spoken before &#8220;Hey man, I don&#8217;t do kilos&#8221;. He said I was over the limit. He urged me to go take a shit. I said NAY, I have already shat! The future plan is to compete as a 231 lifter at Nationals and the Arnie so I didn&#8217;t really care about weight. However this meant I was lifting at 2:30pm instead of 9:00am. Kinda fucked that one up. I re-weighed in around 12:30.

<span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 13px;">The other flights were taking a long time to finish. A 30 min delay which turns into a 2 1/2 hour delay. This sucks if you&#8217;re waiting around trying to stay calm and keep your energy levels up. Luckily I had a great group of people there to support me. Nelson (my chiro) had some extra energy bars that HE PLANNED ON EATING. He gave them to me. I bought him a 40 dollar Chipotle gift card as a thanks (for the meet and the free chiro work).</span>

 <span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 13px;">Warm-up time finally rolled around. I do some quick stretching/foam rolling, then on to the bar. Squats feel good. I hit my last warm-up at 500. It feels EZ. I&#8217;m ready for the platform. My dad let&#8217;s me know that I am 3 out. I stay ready for my opening attempt. I&#8217;ve prepared for several months for this moment. An easy smooth opener to get into the meet. I&#8217;ve tripled this weight before. No problemo. </span>

<span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 13px;">I FUCKING MISS IT. Great. It felt off-center/mis-loaded. I almost fall backwards. I was ashamed/embarrassed. My family and friends had been waiting all day to watch me lift and I fucking blow my first attempt. Callahan and my dad say to move on. That&#8217;s exactly what I did. I ended up reducing my attempts so I could go 2/3. It was the smart move. My confidence would have been shot if I missed another one. They load it to 540 for the second attempt and I crush it. Felt much better. I take 551 after that. It was rough. Not a PR by any means, but my squats were not working that day. A guy named Chris was one of the spotters; he was a real cool dude. He follows 70&#8217;s Big along with some other great guys I met. He was right there in the thick of it trying to help and motivate me. It&#8217;s great to meet dudes like that.</span>

I talk to Shawn during my breather in between Squat/Bench. Even though my squats didn&#8217;t go according to plan, we agreed I was the best looking guy in the building.

Time to bench. It feels way better from the start. As the meet moved on I felt my body and mind working together. We loaded the bar to 350 for my last warm-up. Joke. I go out to the platform with 374 loaded. Blasted it. My abs started to cramp, and I think it was due to some dehydration. I thought I had diluted my Powerade enough, but yeah I was fucking wrong. I take 391 for my second attempt. I was concerned about cramping up at this point. 391 is a PR and even though I&#8217;ve done more in the gym the goal was to PR during the meet. My abs cramp even more. Callahan gives me a lift off. I kill it. The commands were loud and quick. I wave my third attempt Bench because I was concerned about cramping. I really wanted to hit 402 on my third attempt and I think I would have been good for it, but I wanted to save myself for deadlifting in case I cramped. At this point in the day this is not where I pictured myself, but sometimes you have to roll with it and make adjustments.

I try to stay calm during my warm-ups. My dad knows I am on the verge of an [emotional eruption][1]. He tells me one word when he sees me. Calm. Over and over. I did 500 as my opener. It felt like nothing. My dad puts in 550. He looks at me and he says with a smile on his face &#8220;One more then let it all loose&#8221;. I&#8217;m trying not to cry. Not sure why I need to get upset in order to rage out. It&#8217;s mainly a huge stress relief for me. It&#8217;s just the way I get pumped up. I take 550 and it feels even better. I turn and look at him and say &#8220;Welcome to the fucking show&#8221;. I&#8217;m in a haze at this point. He says something along the lines of &#8220;We are at the show now baby&#8221;. My dad is all smiles. He puts in 600. I find a song to play before I am 3 out. Before I know it my dad puts his hand up. He is holding up three of his fingers. I tighten my shoes, pull my socks up, and tighten my belt. I walk over the the line and put on Dom&#8217;s death scene from [Gears of War 3][2]. The music times out perfectly. The head judge looks at me and gives me the thumbs up. Right when he does it the sound fades and Dom says &#8220;[Never thought it would end like this, huh? Huh, Maria?][3]&#8220;. The first piano strike of Gary Jules&#8217; Mad World hits. Marcus screams &#8220;Dom no!&#8221;. I can&#8217;t stop crying. I scream and rush the bar. This was a moment in the making for over a year. The set-up is perfect. I grab the bar and it was perfectly smooth all the way up. I scream in excitement once it is gliding past my knees. It&#8217;s a huge meet PR for me. I let it down after the command and I scream again and hug my dad. Exactly how I wanted to end my day.

For the delays and the changes in weight class I had a great time. I couldn&#8217;t have had any better handlers and people supporting me. I went 7/8. 551/391/600. A total of 1542. Placed 1st in the 242&#8217;s and I got 75 bucks for placing 3rd overall at the meet. I can&#8217;t thank everyone enough. Thanks to everyone who follows 70&#8217;s Big. Wish we could train with all of you!
