Four years ago one of the founding principles of 70&#8217;s Big was to reset the idea of body image in society. At the time, CrossFit was fairly &#8220;anti-strength training&#8221; &#8212; evidenced by HQ&#8217;s proclamation that focused strength training wasn&#8217;t necessary AND rejecting an article I wrote detailing how the &#8220;CrossFit Wichita Falls Program&#8221; (a program I wrote while at Rippetoe&#8217;s WFAC; I refer to it as &#8220;<a href="/files/Articles/Lascek_S&CP_v2.0.pdf" target="_blank">The S&C Program</a>&#8221; now) made all of my trainees very much stronger while increasing their CrossFit performance. I was told it didn&#8217;t contain &#8220;measurable, repeatable data&#8221;, which it did, but that is neither here nor there.

It was thought that the &#8220;workout of the day&#8221; was enough to increase performance and that structured programming was unnecessary and less effective. Let&#8217;s ignore these stupid fucking points and focus on the result: it was more popular to only do met-cons, and most CrossFit guys were lean and small. 70&#8217;s Big was a kind of &#8220;fuck that&#8221; to CrossFit and bodybuilding and focused on the &#8220;big because you&#8217;re strong&#8221; look. Long story short, I give less of a shit about how people train, so long as they do it intelligently and efficiently&#8230;which almost always means they should strength train.

The 70&#8217;s Big mentality is focused on strength, muscularity, healthiness, and being jacked because of it. When I hear bullshit about women thinking they need to lose weight in order to have &#8220;the gap&#8221; (which Mike and I talked about it in <a href="/blog/2013/11/70s-big-radio-episode-15/" target="_blank">70&#8217;s Big Radio Episode 15</a>), or how young girls think they need to weigh a certain amount to &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vBpcSEdcRc" target="_blank">fit in</a>&#8221; with their friends, it drives me fucking crazy.

As long as civilized society exists, people will be concerned with conforming to it. I have no god damn idea why it&#8217;s so important, but to some people it is. I&#8217;ve spent most of my life trying to do the opposite, and hopefully I can help others think the same way. It seems to me that one of the barriers in doing what _you_ want to do instead of what _others_ want you to do is self-confidence. Lifting weights, getting bigger, faster, and stronger can develop confidence. I&#8217;ve seen it in kids, teenagers, young adults, and older folks. Society is fucking weak. Most people get comfortable with something and stick with it. Then they feel chained to it because they _think_ they can&#8217;t do anything else. They lack the confidence in themselves to make it happen.

Yet lifting weights can give people a little kick in the B-hole. They work their ass off to achieve a goal, and they realize that they _can_ do something that previously seemed impossible. When Chris was deadlifting mid 400s for reps, and he said, &#8220;I want to deadlift 600&#215;5,&#8221; I thought it was kind of far-fetched. But the mother fucker trained his dick off every. god. damn. week. And you know what? He eventually did it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkF7Ua6Kpk" target="_blank">watch </a>the vid and <a href="/blog/2012/04/the-evolution-of-chris/" target="_blank">read </a>about the journey; learn about the program to the right).

I&#8217;d like to think that people who lift have a different understanding and expectation of what is sexy and healthy. I&#8217;d like to think that a woman who lifts doesn&#8217;t give a shit about &#8220;the gap&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t even understand. Why would a guy think a space between skin is sexy? How did a bunch of weirdo-neck-beards on the internet popularize this? Some piece of shit in his cubicle at work has power over a young girl&#8217;s mind &#8212; this is truly the future. Furthermore, why do girls think they need to be skinny to have &#8220;the gap&#8221;? You take most chicks, including those with muscular legs from squatting and deadlifting, bend her over, and she&#8217;s probably going to have a gap (Note: only try this if you have female compliance). It&#8217;s called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpubic_angle" target="_blank">subpubic</a> angle, and women have a wider pelvic opening because they need to be able to drop a watermelon-sized child out of their pelvis. This is of course a _BIG _fucking digression since a space between thighs is not fucking sexy anyway; it&#8217;s probably the fact that there is a vagina sitting right above it. Let&#8217;s call a spade a spade; dudes like seeing lady parts and the gap has nothing to do with it.

The internet is a mob, and the mob has power. I&#8217;m here to be the sniper on the clock tower picking off the mob&#8217;s leaders. The gap is a shit-head development from the mob. Instead, aesthetically confused girls (or boys) should focus on strength training and health with the byproduct of sexiness. I&#8217;ve discovered something incredibly important. Since I have that aforementioned <del>narcissism</del> self-confidence, I named it after myself.

This information was garnered from a series of observations in repeated experiments in which the result is _always_ the same. Of course there are other variables that are important, like conditioning (i.e. cardiovascular and respiratory training), other lifts or exercises that can fit into the &#8220;strength&#8221; equation, or other variables that define health like hydration or supplementation, but this is a simplified look at the law. It states that if you put these variables together, the result is sexiness.

Not to insult your intelligence, but notice there isn&#8217;t anything in there about &#8220;losing weight&#8221; or even &#8220;gaining weight&#8221;. There isn&#8217;t anything about &#8220;being able to see through someone&#8217;s legs while their feet are together&#8221;. There isn&#8217;t anything about seeing beads of oil accumulating on rippled abs. There isn&#8217;t even an opportunity to leave your sexiness up for interpretation, even to yourself. Most importantly, there is nothing in this equation that indicates someone outside of **you** has any control over your sexiness.

Your friends do not provide a comparison to derive your hotness. People in your demographic group (i.e. gender and age) do not define your attractiveness. I&#8217;m not even giving you false hope in saying that your mindset determines your sexiness! There are fat people out there who think they are da bomb, but we all know they aren&#8217;t, so I&#8217;m not going to bullshit you into thinking you can look however you want yet feel like sexual god. I&#8217;m giving you an absolute, measurable way to determine your sexiness. How strong are you? How consistent is your training? How well do you eat (learn more to the right)? How well do you sleep? This is all quantifiable and can be recorded with any effort or OCD. If you&#8217;re gonna have a complex about your aesthetics, let it be a healthy one. Frisbee your weight scale out the window and tell the people that try to influence your body, clothes, or style to go fuck themselves. You&#8217;ll be free; you&#8217;ll be in control. Implement Lascek&#8217;s Law, because, like me, it&#8217;s never fucking wrong.
