Yesterday I told you to enjoy your holiday break, but to reflect on 2013&#8217;s training. Now I want to hear what it is you accomplished. Though PR Fridays have been less frequent, they historically provide a venue to talk about your own weekly improvement or personal records. Let&#8217;s face it, sometimes your wife (husband?) or co-workers just don&#8217;t give a shit or understand what it&#8217;s like to get a 10 lb deadlift PR, so sharing it with other lifters nets an appropriate response.

Look back over 2013 and think about what you accomplished. Did elevate your training to the next level? Did you compete? Did you experience any injuries? Let us know how it went. Training is intimately related with what else is going on in your life, so recap the non-training part of your life. Did you get married (I did), graduate, or get a new job? All of these things effect your training but also count as leveling up in life.

Lifting isn&#8217;t just something we do because we love it; we need to do it. It&#8217;s the great leveler, the thing that brings you back to reality or reminds you how progress requires blood and sweat. The lessons under the bar have direct application in life&#8217;s success; let us know how training has influenced your life in 2013.
