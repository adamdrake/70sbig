This was easily one of the best podcasts we&#8217;ve done. We talked about Scott Mendelson&#8217;s pec insane pec tear, sorta criticized strongman training, something Eric Cressey said, and Tony Budding&#8217;s new Pro Fitness League, and a whole lot of shit that doesn&#8217;t make much sense but made us laugh our asses off.
