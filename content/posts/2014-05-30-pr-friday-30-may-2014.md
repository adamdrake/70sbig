70&#8217;s Big has the tradition of **PR Friday**, where readers are invited to talk about their weekly PR&#8217;s and training updates. Posting regularly expands the sense of community, and it also keeps other people updated on your progress. Many friendships have started because someone was brave enough to start posting on PR Friday.

I also used to do a **Weekly Q&A** where I took questions throughout the week and answered them in the PR Friday post. I don&#8217;t exactly have the time to prepare long, in depth responses, but we&#8217;ll start answering questions in the comments of PR Friday. You&#8217;ll have me, Mike, Chris, AC, and probably not Brent answering questions.

Once I got busy, these Friday posts dropped off, but they are back and will occur every week. I&#8217;m also aiming to put out a post every Monday, so you&#8217;ll get something twice a week.

Without further adieu, post your PR&#8217;s, training updates, questions, and shenanigans to the comments. I leave you with this:

> Chalk floats softly through the air. The thumping of your heart is all you hear, all you feel. You step to the bar and place your hands on it, feeling the cold knurling on callused hands. The whirling hurricane of emotion settles into the eye of the storm, the peaceful moment when you decide to begin.
