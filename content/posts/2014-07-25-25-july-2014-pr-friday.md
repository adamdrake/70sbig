<em style="color: #373737;"><strong>PR Friday</strong> — Post your training updates, PR’s, and questions to the comments and the 70′s Big crew will respond. </em>

<strong style="color: #373737;">Weekly Q&A </strong><span style="color: #373737;">gives you a chance to ask anyone from the 70′s Big Crew a question in the comments, on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. </span>

**Homework: **Earlier this week I asked you guys to look up what muscles are involved in hip extension. Did anybody bite? I&#8217;ll get to this topic in the comments.

Meanwhile, look how small Z is.
