During the Q&A a week or so ago, some members were asking for a regularly updated &#8220;show&#8221; on YouTube (since they are the cool thing to do in the fitness-sphere).

In episode #1 I&#8217;m talking about knee control in the squat. A common problem with squatting is that trainees don&#8217;t have control of what their knees are doing because their external hip rotators &#8212; particularly the glutes &#8212; are not trained to maintain tension throughout the movement. In this video I show one of my wife&#8217;s front squat sets where you can see when she actively engages the external rotators and when she does not. Her case is specific: she had a long term hip injury and front squats focused on this glute activation have been the rehab. Don&#8217;t focus on my cues as I&#8217;m trying more so to talk to the camera than her, but also the cues she and I have for this issue are vague because she understands what she is supposed to do after we spent a lot of time teaching her what &#8220;correct&#8221; felt like.

In any case, this is the first episode of Chalk Talk. Discuss in the comments and feel free to request new topics.
