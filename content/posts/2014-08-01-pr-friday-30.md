<em style="color: #373737;"><strong>PR Friday</strong>&nbsp;— Post your training updates, PR’s, and questions to the comments and the 70′s Big crew will respond.&nbsp;</em>

<strong style="color: #373737;">Weekly Q&A&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #373737;">gives you a chance to ask anyone from the 70′s Big Crew a question in the comments, on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Follow 70&#8217;s Big on <a href="http://instagram.com/70s_Big" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</span>

Don&#8217;t forget to check out the first episode of <a href="/blog/2014/07/chalk-talk-1-squat-knee-control/" target="_blank">Chalk Talk</a>. Hopefully Mike and I can match up for a podcast this weekend.

Misha Koklyaev is such an awesome strength athlete and has an awesome personality. He needs to tour the states like Klokov has been.
