Chalk Talk is a new little show on the YouTube channel where I&#8217;ll try and take advantage of the video format to teach.

I got the idea for this episode because I pulled these two books out to investigate about a mild pain I had in my sacro-iliac joint. Whenever someone presents with pain or an injury I&#8217;m not familiar with, I&#8217;ll open up available resources, review the anatomy, and see if I can add any information to my thought process.

Additionally, when someone is new to the coaching or training realm, I recommend these books because they are a great way to learn or sustain musculoskeletal anatomy knowledge.
