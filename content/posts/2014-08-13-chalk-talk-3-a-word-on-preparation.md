Some people want to be bigger. Some want less body fat. Everyone wants to be stronger. There&#8217;s a recurring theme with all of these goals: they can&#8217;t be accomplished by merely going to the gym. Performance, aesthetics, fitness, or health are all optimized by doing more than just a training session.

Today&#8217;s Chalk Talk briefly touches on the importance of preparation. How can you better prepare your nutrition? Training sessions? Mobility? Sleep? Relaxation? Post your answers to comments along with what you&#8217;ll do to improve.
