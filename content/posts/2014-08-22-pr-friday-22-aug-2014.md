**Recap: **On Monday I introduced <a href="/blog/2014/08/category-programming/" target="_blank">Category Programming</a>, a method that works well for very busy or beat down trainees like SOF personnel. <a href="http://wp.me/pEKxw-2Gj" target="_blank">Chalk Talk #4</a> came out on Wednesday, and it focuses on actively contracting the lower abs to stabilize the trunk while pressing.

Here&#8217;s a video that talks about Usain Bolt&#8217;s difficult training regime. He says that race day is the fun part, but all the hard work is miserable. His own dad even says he can&#8217;t go to his practices anymore because he doesn&#8217;t like to watch him suffer.

Being a professional athlete isn&#8217;t the same as our training. Bolt dedicates his life to that one moment in which he displays his prowess on the track. There&#8217;s nothing corny in Bolt&#8217;s presentation. It&#8217;s simple and brutal: being great is a trying, vomitous affair that makes you want to quit every step of the way. Anything good or successful in life demands the same.

**What do you think is the worst part about training? Pushing through a set? Doing mobility work? Eating right? **
