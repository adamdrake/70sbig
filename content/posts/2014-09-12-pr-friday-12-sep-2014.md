**Recap: **On Monday we had a guest post from Australian SOF vet Shaun Trainor on a <a href="/blog/2014/08/flexible-training-programs/" target="_blank">flexible training program</a> when deployed, super busy, or beat down. <a href="/blog/2014/09/chalk-talk-7/" target="_blank">Chalk Talk #7</a> shows how to work on the quadratus lumborum and glute medius to alleviate pain in the low back and sacro-iliac area.

Here&#8217;s a sweet video of AC hitting a PR double at the time of 600&#215;2. You see his warm-up sets and then the final set where he loses his god damn shit. AC is, how do you say&#8230;more of an emotional lifter. He uses a big adrenaline dump prior to lifting and gets pumped when he hits his lifts in training and meets.

**What is your lifting style? Do you get emotionally amped? Yell and scream? Or do you have a silent rage? A calm before the storm? **
