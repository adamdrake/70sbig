<a href="/blog/2014/09/flexible-training-programs/" target="_blank">In a recent post</a> by my Australian SOF buddy, Shaun Trainor, he reminded me that I recommended he do speed deadlifts and RDL&#8217;s while he was deployed in lieu of heavy deadlifts. In a program or circumstance that can&#8217;t tolerate the systemic depression or local soreness associated with heavy deadlifts, using speed deadlifts with posterior chain work will still get explosive work with the posterior chain. When Shaun returned home, he was able to jump back up to his previous deadlift numbers fairly quick.

Speed deadlifts can be alternated every week with heavy deadlifts, as they are in a few of my Texas Method templates, or they can be done every week to maintain some deadlift work without getting beat down. Not to mention you can accumulate some decent volume with doubles or triples on deadlift to develop a jacked back.

If you watch until the end of the video, you&#8217;ll see an explanation of NOT leaning back at the top of a deadlift. It&#8217;s a common fault that is incredibly injurious, looks ugly, and makes someone look inexperienced with anatomy or lifting. Simply lift the chest to ensure a neutral spine; don&#8217;t lean back.
