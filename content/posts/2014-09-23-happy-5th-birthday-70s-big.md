On 22 September 2009 this website launched in order to educate people about strength and conditioning as well as entertain. The focus was on being big, muscular, and strong in a time dominated by emaciation. Women were encouraged to train, men were encouraged to pound the calories, and everyone was pushed into competition.

Over the years the site has evolved due to a combination of getting jaded with the same kindergarten material available across the &#8220;training-sphere&#8221; as well as an obligation to not only teach people to get strong, but to keep them healthy and strong through life. We should all aim to train our bodies, minds, and souls deep into old age. The basic tenants of 70sBig.com remain the same:

&#8211; commit to training with reckless intensity
  
&#8211; develop a physique built with performance instead of vanity
  
&#8211; help encourage others in their training
  
&#8211; enter competition for ultimate introspection
  
&#8211; teach and learn about strength and conditioning, mobility, nutrition, anatomy, physiology, fitness, etc.
  
&#8211; tirelessly lead the charge to end misconceptions about females and lifting

&#8211; have a damn good time doing it

It&#8217;s always been my intention to help people through 70sBig.com. I hope whoever you are, whether you&#8217;ve been here since day one or just started reading yesterday, you have gained benefit from this website&#8217;s five years of information. When I find the time, I regularly work to improve our knowledge and synthesize material you can implement into your own training and life.

**This wouldn&#8217;t be possible without all of you. **I want to thank all of the readers, new and old. I consider you a part of the 70&#8217;s Big Community, one full of crazy assholes who are some of the nicest, hard working, and amusing folks around. The reach of 70&#8217;s Big is broad, and it&#8217;s comforting to know that we can go almost anywhere in the world, talk about 70&#8217;s Big and immediately have a bond with a stranger. &#8220;70&#8217;s Big takes care of their own,&#8221; is a comforting thought. We&#8217;ve built something really cool here and this is as much your birthday as it is mine.

To all of my friends around the world &#8212; whether I&#8217;ve met you or not, held a seminar in your gym, trained with you, or lectured to your unit &#8212; thanks for making this fun. And to my close friends who were integral in the creation of this website: thanks for being there for me with your absurd, unique, and loyal personality.

The future is always bright to people who attack it with fervor. 70&#8217;s Big will always be around to educate, entertain, and irritate you. The idea of communicating with all of you assholes through old age will, at the very least, be entertaining.

Train hard, get big. Get 70&#8217;s Big.

Happy Birthday
