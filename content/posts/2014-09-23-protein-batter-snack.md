Need some calories? Protein? Want to satisfy that sweet tooth but keep the food items pretty clean? Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re gonna do:

1. Put 1 to 3 tablespoons of a nut butter in a bowl.

2. Add a small amount of butter (grass fed is ideal).

3. Microwave it for 30 seconds.

4. Put a scoop of protein in. Stir it up.

5. Add in goodies for flavoring (cocoa powder, cinnamon, vanilla extract, etc.) or consistency (almond milk).

6. Consume.

Some people call this protein cookie dough. Some call it protein cake batter. I just call it a good time. Two tablespoons of most nut butters will yield around 16g of fat, 7g of carbs, and 7g of protein. Protein scoops will range from 20 to 28g (the latter is whey isolate). Add in a little extra fat from the butter (1/2 a tablespoon is about 5g). You end up with about 20g of fat, 30g of protein, and less than 10g of carbs for about 330 calories.

I consider all of these food items acceptable in my <a href="/books/pale-for-lifters/" target="_blank"><em>Paleo for Lifters</em></a> approach. The only issue would be what kind of fat you&#8217;re getting from the nut butter, but if you&#8217;re training hard, otherwise eating clean, and still consuming some fish oil, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a big deal. And, as my wife proved to me over the weekend, you can put almonds in a food processor and make almond butter, so other than the protein powder and whatever you use to liquify the mixture, there doesn&#8217;t have to be any not-clean ingredients.

I don&#8217;t drink milk, so slamming a glass of almond milk after eating this was particularly satisfying.

Dark chocolate almond butter works really well, but you could use regular almond or peanut butter. You could throw a square of dark chocolate in or add/subtract things like vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa, and and almond milk for different effects. You could probably solidify it in the fridge, or drizzle it on bananas or strawberries. If you eat oatmeal, it&#8217;d probably mix pretty well in there.

It&#8217;s pretty caloric dense, so if you&#8217;re trying to lose body fat it may not be ideal. But then again, it might be better than engulfing a pint of Ben and Jerry&#8217;s. If you were short on time, this is something you could make really quick and store in a small tupperware for the next day. Add a high density carb and it might be pretty good to take on a trail (assuming you&#8217;re at an altitude and work rate that can tolerate fat). Otherwise, enjoy this caloric dense snack.
