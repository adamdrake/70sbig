You&#8217;ll have access to either Justin, Mike, Chris, Brent, and AC (click here for bios) to develop a programming template based on your goals, current state of adaptation, and schedule availability.

Each 70&#8217;s Big team member has an expertise in strength and conditioning from the novice to advanced ability, everyone has competed in a national lifting event, some in international competition, everyone has handled lifters in numerous meets. Some of us have advanced proficiency in specific athletic endeavors:

**Justin** &#8211; military/SOF, CrossFit, mobility, collegiate sports, Olympic weightlifting

**Chris** &#8211; powerlifting, team sports (football, rugby, basketball, etc.)

**Brent** &#8211; Olympic weightlifting, mobility

**AC** &#8211; powerlifting, football (including professional players), collegiate sports

**Batt** &#8211; strongman, powerlifting

_**Note:** _Justin, AC, and Chris have all worked in division I collegiate strength and conditioning facilities with various sports, hence the &#8220;collegiate sports&#8221; term above.

If you&#8217;re interested in a single or monthly consultation, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:70sBigConsult@gmail.com" target="_blank">70sBigConsult@gmail.com</a> and include the type of consultation you want, if you have a coach preference, and what your goal is.
