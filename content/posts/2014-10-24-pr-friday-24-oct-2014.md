**Recap: **On Monday I addressed a question about &#8220;<a href="/blog/2014/10/reverse-dieting/" target="_blank">Reverse Dieting</a>&#8220;, and it led to a simple discussion on basic nutrition philosophy. <a href="/blog/2014/10/chalk-talk-9/" target="_blank">Chalk Talk #9</a> briefly showed one armed farmer&#8217;s walks and how they can strengthen the quadratus lumborum muscle.

Here&#8217;s Misha Koklyaev, one of the most impressive strength athletes of all time, doing one of his trademark ladders. This one is a deadlift ladder to 360kg (792 pounds) and back down.

Misha performs at a world level in powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting, and strongman. What sport would you prefer to shine in? What sports have you competed in?
