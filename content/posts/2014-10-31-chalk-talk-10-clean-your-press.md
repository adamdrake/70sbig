Since I was clean and pressing last week, I figured I&#8217;d turn it into a Chalk Talk that revisits the &#8220;<a href="/blog/2011/12/clean-your-press/" target="_blank">Clean Your Press</a>&#8221; post from three years ago. It also forces me to do a video in one take since I&#8217;m actually lifting in the beginning (it&#8217;s just 90k for a double).

Power cleaning the press can accomplish several things like: give you extra clean practice, work more musculature, get more of a systemic stress, and look a lot cooler than everyone else in the gym picking their press out of the rack.

I prefer to clean presses. The main thing most people need to work on is catching the bar in the press position instead of a clean position, which is preferable to catching the bar in a front rack and repositioning for&nbsp;the press. You&#8217;ll need to have good practice with the grip, hand position on the bar, and elbow position, and you can read/watch more about that in &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/09/3-press-fixes/" target="_blank">3 Press Fixes</a>&#8220;.

Note that spandex will help.
