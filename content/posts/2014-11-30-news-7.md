Times are busy, yes indeed. While I&#8217;m limited in being able to write for the site, I&#8217;ll try to keep up on the &#8220;education and nonsense&#8221; front with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JLascek" target="_blank">Chalk Talk</a> videos. Between a full day&#8217;s work and visiting family, I&#8217;m nearing completion on another book that&#8217;ll help the every day man maximize his upper body strength and jackedness. Look for that one near the new year. Otherwise, the 70&#8217;s Big Consultation Team is still active and providing excellent information and programs to trainees and athletes (<a href="/programming/consultation/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a> to learn more).

We do a lot of &#8220;behind the scenes work&#8221; to not only train folks, but to develop quality information to you, the reader. In the mean time, use 70&#8217;s Big as a way to communicate with your fellow strength and conditioning brethren, discuss topics, share knowledge, and have a jolly good time.
