This particular video tackles the problem a lot of people have during the holiday season: a lack of time for training. You don&#8217;t have to have an &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; attitude with your program. Even doing a short training session is better than none at all, and the chronic effect of training is more important than what you do today. It doesn&#8217;t have to be heavy, it doesn&#8217;t have to be a lot, but it does need to be systemic. The video shows an example of a quick workout as well as providing other examples with all the reasons why.
