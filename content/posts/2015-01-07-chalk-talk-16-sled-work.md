Sleds are a wonderful conditioning tool that can hit any end of the metabolic spectrum. In this post you see me do a round of sled pushing and then struggle through the first few seconds of panting hard. I guess I won’t do my talking AFTER hard sets anymore. The wife said it was comically unbearable during the filming.

Have you pushed a sled before? What kind of sled workouts do you do? How has it helped you?
