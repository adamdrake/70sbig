Joint approximation is manipulating joints into a better or optimal position to restore function. It facilitates stretching and is effective at preparing certain joints for training. I give a brief explanation of it, and then show a very effective way of applying posterior distraction on the hip to open up the hip flexors.
  
Have you used joint approximation stuff before? What have you found to be beneficial? Does this method help open you up for training?
