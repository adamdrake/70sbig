Ladies. Gentlemen. Today I reveal my next book: _The 70&#8217;s Big LP_.

[<img data-attachment-id="10617" data-permalink="/blog/2015/02/new-book-announcement/70sbig_lp-medium/" data-orig-file="/2015/02/70sBig_LP-medium.jpg" data-orig-size="500,646" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="70sBig_LP-medium" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2015/02/70sBig_LP-medium-155x200.jpg" data-large-file="/2015/02/70sBig_LP-medium-450x581.jpg" class="  wp-image-10617 alignleft" src="/2015/02/70sBig_LP-medium-450x581.jpg" alt="70sBig_LP-medium" width="255" height="327" srcset="/2015/02/70sBig_LP-medium-116x150.jpg 116w, /2015/02/70sBig_LP-medium-155x200.jpg 155w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" />][1]I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;What kind of a stupid asshole puts himself on a cover like that?&#8221;

The answer is an asshole who wants to get you stronger. Jacked. _Thick. _TIGHT!

When I first started planning this  book in 2011, I considered it an **arm training program**. But as I experimented and wrote, it became clear that it&#8217;s a legitimate program&#8230;that just so happens to make impressive arms.

&nbsp;

_The 70&#8217;s Big LP is a&#8230;_

  * **Linear Strength Progression** – This is another option for novices to get stronger and bigger. The inclusion of things like rows, chin-ups, and curls will prevent the “big legs, small arms” body so many guys get from only squatting.
  * **Transition from Bodybuilding to Strength Training** – This program is a good transition from bodybuilding because it includes a bit of vanity training, but not at the expense of strength training. Bodybuilding guys can even use this as a mass gaining program; the decrease in training frequency and overall volume combined with hard eating cannot be denied.
  * **Transition to Intermediate Programming** – Each exercise in this program has several set/rep schemes to keep you progressing for a long time. Some of them breach into the realm of intermediate programming. There’s a gray area between novice and intermediate programming, and _The 70’s Big LP_ connects the two.

At the core of it, this program is an innovative strength program that allows &#8212; no, encourages! &#8212; you to build those pythons, brother. It places big, compound exercises into a strength program to force the upper body to grow. Then it feeds you curls and triceps work to whet your appetite, because shut up.

Sick of not getting those noodly appendages to grow? Look no further because _The 70&#8217;s Big LP _has you covered. And the best part is, you don&#8217;t have to sacrifice your strength training to get there: when I used this program in 2011 I PR&#8217;d on press (240 lbs), bench (350 lbs), deadlift (500 lbs), and pull-ups (21 reps) at a 210 body weight.

This is the _basic_ template. It may look a bit vanilla, but what sets _The 70&#8217;s Big LP _apart from other linear progressions or programs is in the set/rep schemes. Each exercise listed in the template has at least three different set/rep schemes to force progress for a long time &#8212; many of which I&#8217;ve never seen out there on the ol&#8217; world wide web.

It&#8217;s a magical program. You can get bigger, jacked, or strong, or all three. You can start or continue your linear progression. You can bridge the gap to intermediate programming. You can use it as a mass gain program. This program is about _you_ getting the results you want. So saddle up partner; let&#8217;s get to work.

_The 70&#8217;s Big LP will  be available for purchase tomorrow, 20 February 2015. _
