In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cROanmpleyY" target="_blank">Chalk Talk #17</a> I talked about some joint approximation stuff you can do to work on your hips prior to training. Today&#8217;s Chalk Talk puts a new twist on some classic stretches by adding banded distraction. It&#8217;s actually easy to perform because you don&#8217;t need to tie the band off on anything; you just tie it on your own hip and use your other foot to add tension.

What do you do to open your hips up before training?
