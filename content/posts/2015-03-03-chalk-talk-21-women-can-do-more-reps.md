There always seems to be a little bit of controversy when I bring this topic up. I wanted to try using a visual aid to make the following point: at a given percentage of their respective 1RM, women can do more reps than males. The reason is due to hormones, but that concept leaves the scope of the video. Note that women can increase their neuromuscular efficiency &#8212; just like men can &#8212; with training.

What examples of this have you seen in your training (if you are a female) or women in your gym?
