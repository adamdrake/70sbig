**Here is what some of your fellow readers have to say about PFL:**

&#8220;Definitely one of the best e-book purchases I&#8217;ve made. Clear, descriptive writing, no typos (Jesus, the typos in other people&#8217;s &#8220;edited&#8221; work that I&#8217;ve \*paid for\* astounds me), and information that I have not been able to find elsewhere.&#8221; -Will

&#8220;I routinely refer people to the book as a concise and practical introduction to paleo dieting within the context of strength athletics.&#8221; -J.T.

&#8220;Paleo for Lifters provides the trainee with a great insight into how the Paleo diet and derivatives thereof can be used to fuel the body for strength sports. Justin Lascek successfully instructs the reader in planning a clean diet that not only supports strength training but can also be tailored to build an ideal body mass and composition.&#8221; -Andrew

&#8220;I absolutely love Paleo for Lifters! It showed me how to eat clean but eat big for needed fuel. At 6&#8217;4&#8243; 200 lbs and a Crossfitter/Mountain Biker I can&#8217;t afford to skimp on muscle building food.  Paleo for Lifters got me back to getting stronger not constantly struggling on low energy eating. &#8221; -Lester

&#8220;Justin always cuts through to the most usable pieces of the information and ignores the silly shit. Very helpful.&#8221; -Kyle
