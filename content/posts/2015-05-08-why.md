Times are a changin&#8217;.

Folks in times like the Great War did things because they had to. Nowadays most of us privileged, first-world folk get to do things because we want to.

> I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.

Little did Mr. Adams know, people would hide themselves behind glowing screens, living vicariously through the exaggerated deeds of others. Past efforts in politics, war, and commerce provide the freedom to do&#8230;or don&#8217;t.

But that&#8217;s what sets us apart. Every time you step under a bar, you&#8217;re doing. Instead of talking or watching, you execute. Every time you look at the distance you&#8217;ll sprint or the thing you&#8217;ll lift with an honest, healthy fear, you are _doing_. When you look down at your hands and see grit, callus, and blood, it&#8217;s the product of work. The product of life.

You train for a purpose, do you not? Training is nearly synonymous with suffering, because true training is difficult. At times, it&#8217;s a giant pain in the ass. The moment is hard when the doubt or fear sets in. The planning is hard when you pass on adult beverages or place head to pillow one hour earlier. But there is purpose to this suffering. Not only for the end result, but the moment of clarity when you burst through the fear or adversity. It&#8217;s the small victory, the success in the moment. It&#8217;s re-racking or lowering a weight with quivering muscles, the electricity flowing through your body. At the _success_ in the moment. There is purpose to this suffering.

And that&#8217;s why we do it.
