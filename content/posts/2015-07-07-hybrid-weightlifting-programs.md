Everyone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pm4fQRl72k" target="_blank">wants it all</a>. CrossFit. Powerlifting. Weightlifting. All of it. Well, unfortunately the body doesn&#8217;t work like that. The more performance metrics you aim for, the more you limit the development of one of them; this is the concept of specificity in training.

Sometimes you have weightlifters who want to get stronger, jacked. Some times you have lifters wanting to dabble in weightlifting. Sometimes they just want it all. Well, here are a few resources for hybrid weightlifting programs.

This is Glenn Pendlay&#8217;s answer to how he would structure training for both powerlifting and weightlifting. I like the template. It allows for decent squat work, benching, overhead work, and still leaves room for two weightlifting days. The first weightlifting day is lighter and technique oriented while the latter is a heavier day.

**<a href="/blog/2012/07/transitioning-to-olympic-weightlifting/" target="_blank">70&#8217;s Big &#8211; Transitioning to Olympic Weightlifting</a>**

I wrote this a long time ago for myself and some of my lifters. It&#8217;s similar to Pendlay&#8217;s program above, but the weightlifting day comes before the strength day. This allows the lifter to be fresh for the quick lifts at the expense of the squatting and pressing. Also, the set/rep scheme for the Olympic lifts is a bit different. The weightlifting sessions are set up where one of the lifts is done with light to medium weight while the other lift is heavy. There are all kinds of different set/rep schemes, including the newer ones from _<a href="/books/the-70s-big-lp/" target="_blank">The 70&#8217;s Big LP</a> _that could be dropped in.

Another note about this template &#8212; it&#8217;s what I always recommend to strength athletes who are getting into weightlifting. Without fail, they will jump into a program where they snatch and CJ three or more times a week only to run into some kind of joint issue. Whether it&#8217;s sore knees, hips, elbows, or shoulders, I see it every time regardless if they are weak or strong. Do yourself a favor and use the &#8220;progressive overload&#8221; concept of programming and ease into new training.

This is just a 3x/week adaptation of the previous 4x/week program.

What are some other hybrid weightlifting programs you&#8217;ve used? Have any others to add to the list?
