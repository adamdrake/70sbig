I&#8217;ve been away for a bit, and when I look around at the realm of strength and conditioning,  I see the good and bad.

The good? The training population swells with eager trainees aiming for a bigger deadlift, a beautiful snatch, or a better metabolic engine. We have awesome lifters in USAW, raw powerlifting is surging, and thousands of people _train _instead of fiddling around with exercise. This is good.

The bad? Everybody&#8217;s an expert. Strength and conditioning is interesting because if a guy is good at _doing _it, he is not automatically good at _teaching_ it. Athlete X accomplishes Y and then opens up shop for consultations and seminars. I&#8217;m not saying there isn&#8217;t room in the market, but a lack of knowledge in physiology, anatomy, metabolism, programming, etc. results in a disservice to the student and customer. This is bad.

It&#8217;s rare that any of the new information is profound. Organizing performance training isn&#8217;t complicated and there are no secrets. Consider the following:

&#8211; Perform large compound strength movements like squat, press, bench, deadlift, row, and pull-ups on a regular basis.

&#8211; Address mobility and muscular imbalance/weakness issues.

&#8211; Don&#8217;t do a stupid amount of volume and avoid most aesthetic-focused programs.

&#8211; Understand &#8220;met-con&#8221; or &#8220;high intensity conditioning&#8221; does not mean &#8220;consisting of retarded shit all the time.&#8221;

&#8211; Organize the training week to apply stress and give subsequent rest.

&#8211; First, specify to your needs, then your wants.

These are the tenets of performance training. Stick to these concepts and you won&#8217;t really need a glistening six pack telling you &#8220;IF IT FITS YOUR MACROS.&#8221; I understand the &#8220;How and why?&#8221; are your limiting factor. Now that I&#8217;ve knocked some rust off, I&#8217;m here to help. If I can&#8217;t stream the content out, I&#8217;ll at least be a bubbling brook.
