Recently both of my younger brothers asked me to help them with a training program. One of the first &#8220;lessons&#8221; I gave them was how to organize a training session for a program oriented towards getting stronger, building size, and leaning out. Here is a quick guide on how to do so.

  * Begin with a general warm-up. This can be light calisthenics, walking, jogging, rowing, or biking for 2 to 10 minutes.
  * Do some mobility work. Massage or roll first, then stretch. Rolling the soft tissue helps loosen it up before trying to stretch on it. I&#8217;m going to remake a video o this soon, but hit the upper back, lower back, hips, and quads at a minimum. Joint approximation should be done last. The point of mobility before training is to improve range of motion to facilitate good mechanics &#8212; especially if the correct ROM of the exercise is limited.
  * Warm-up with the main lift you&#8217;re doing that day. That means start with the bar for a set of five and then progressively add weight until you reach the first set. As your warm-up sets go up, titrate the reps down. For example, if my first set was 225&#215;5, I could do warm-ups like this: 
      * 45&#215;5
      * 95&#215;5
      * 135&#215;5
      * 185&#215;3
      * 205&#215;2 or 1
      * First set of 225&#215;5

  * Do all of the work sets for the main lift of that day. Bodybuilding programs like to add unnecessary super-sets; to get stronger and bigger, do the compound strength movement first. Do it for 3-5 sets of 3-5 reps.
  * Now it&#8217;s time for assistance exercises. Do compound exercises before isolation exercises. Do the strength related exercises first; do the hypertrophy (or muscle building) exercises last. Do them for 3-5 sets of 5-10 reps. 
      * Compound assistance exercises include pull-ups, rows, lunges, and dips. You won&#8217;t need much more than this.
      * Isolation assistance exercises include curls or triceps extensions. Don&#8217;t bother with leg curls or leg extensions.

  * Finish the session with high intensity conditioning. Conditioning should be something short and hard, just like your pecker. 30 seconds of running fast, 30 seconds of rest on a treadmill. Or 30 second bike sprint and then 30 seconds of easy pace. 50 to 150 burpees for time. 400m sprints. Some of the old benchmark CrossFit workouts like &#8220;Cindy&#8221; (you can cap the time at 10 minutes) and &#8220;Helen&#8221; are pretty good. Push a sled. Sprint up a hill. Running has a bad rap because it&#8217;s the worst fucking thing ever, but athletes need to sprint. You can&#8217;t look like an athlete without training like one. So, sprint.

There&#8217;s nothing flashy or sexy about how to organize a training session. Do something that looks like this three or four times a week consistently, sleep eight hours a night, and pay attention to not eating like shit, and any beginner will make progress.
