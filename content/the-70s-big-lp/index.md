The answer is an asshole who wants to get you stronger. Jacked. _Thick.&nbsp;_TIGHT!

When I first started planning this &nbsp;book in 2011, I considered it an **arm training program**. But as I experimented and wrote, it became clear that it&#8217;s a legitimate program&#8230;that just so happens to make impressive arms.

_The 70&#8217;s Big LP is a&#8230;_

  * **Linear Strength Progression** – This is another option for novices to get stronger and bigger. The inclusion of things like rows, chin-ups, and curls will prevent the “big legs, small arms” body so many guys get from only squatting.
  * **Transition from Bodybuilding to Strength Training** – This program is a good transition from bodybuilding because it includes a bit of vanity training, but not at the expense of strength training. Bodybuilding guys can even use this as a mass gaining program; the decrease in training frequency and overall volume combined with hard eating cannot be denied.
  * **Transition to Intermediate Programming** – Each exercise in this program has several set/rep schemes to keep you progressing for a long time. Some of them breach into the realm of intermediate programming. There’s a gray area between novice and intermediate programming, and _The 70’s Big LP_ connects the two.

At the core of it, this program is an innovative strength program that allows &#8212; no, encourages! &#8212; you to build those pythons, brother. It places big, compound exercises into a strength program to force the upper body to grow. Then it feeds you curls and triceps work to whet your appetite, because shut up.

Sick of not getting those noodly appendages to grow? Look no further because&nbsp;_The 70&#8217;s Big LP&nbsp;_has you covered. And the best part is, you don&#8217;t have to sacrifice your strength training to get there: when I used this program in 2011 I PR&#8217;d on press (240 lbs), bench (350 lbs), deadlift (500 lbs), and pull-ups (21 reps) at a 210 body weight.

This is the&nbsp;_basic_ template. It may look a bit vanilla, but what sets&nbsp;_The 70&#8217;s Big LP&nbsp;_apart from other linear progressions or programs is in the set/rep schemes. Each exercise listed in the template has at least three different set/rep schemes to force progress for a long time &#8212; many of which I&#8217;ve never seen out there on the ol&#8217; world wide web.

It&#8217;s a magical program. You can get bigger, jacked, or strong, or all three. You can start or continue your linear progression. You can bridge the gap to intermediate programming. You can use it as a mass gain program. This program is about&nbsp;_you_&nbsp;getting the results you want. So saddle up partner; let&#8217;s get to work.

This is easily the best looking e-book I&#8217;ve released. It has plenty of tables that visually represent the text that will serve as a teaching aid as well as a reference tool.

While this book includes templates telling you exactly what to do, it&#8217;s designed for the user to make choices about training. These decisions are based on your goals, strength, and how far along these set/rep scheme progressions you are. In each book I release, I try to teach the reader as much as I can about programming. A lot of you want to mindlessly follow something, but that will never be optimal for you because it&#8217;s not designed for&nbsp;_you_.

This book also does not tell you exactly what to lift; on linear progression does. Instead, it teaches you what you should be doing on the next training session based on your last training session. It&#8217;s irresponsible to base your all of your sets on a percent of 1RM because linear progressions inherently change the 1RM in every training session. If you are a novice or intermediate, your adaptation should be improved on a daily or weekly basis respectively. Instead, I teach you how to conduct your set/rep schemes and what to do to progress them. Once you learn all of that, you can&nbsp;take the templates at the end of Chapter 2 and tweak them to your advantage.
