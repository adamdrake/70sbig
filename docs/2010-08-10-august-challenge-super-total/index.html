  <p>The August Challenge is simple. Work up to your heaviest single in the snatch, clean &amp; jerk, squat, bench press, and deadlift. That’s your total. I say heaviest single because this won’t be a max. <strong>You can take as many attempts as you need</strong>. Make your jumps and attempts wisely (the smart ones will not take three attempts on every lift).</p>

<p>Here are the rules (because someone will ask):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This must all be done in one session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifts must be done in order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The snatch and clean and jerk must be caught in a locked-out position. If you press it out, it doesn’t count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, it’s ok if you power snatch or power clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squat must be to depth-crease of hip below top of knee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bench does not have to pause on chest. This doesn’t mean you should dribble the bar off your sternum, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deadlift must be raised without hitching. It must also be lowered to the ground, not dropped above the knee like some dumbass. Your mama raised you better than that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sumo is fine. Straps are not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Belt is mandatory <span style="text-decoration: line-through">unless you’re a jackass</span> fine. Knee sleeves or light knee wraps are also ok. All other non-injectable gear is disallowed. No bench shirts or squat panties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For results, please put</p>
<p>Name</p>
<p>(Sex if you are female)</p>
<p>(Pics if you are female?)</p>
<p>Weight class (below)</p>
<p>Bodyweight</p>
<p>Lifts (in pounds)</p>
<p>Total (in pounds)</p>
<p>If there are five or more from a gym, put your gym name and I’ll include a gym grouping.</p>
<p>I’ll do results for weight class and absolute. Happy lifting.</p>
<p>Men: <span style="text-decoration: line-through">52 kg, 56 kg, 60 kg, 67.5 kg, 75 kg,</span> 82.5 kg, 90 kg, 100 kg, 110 kg, 125 kg, 125 kg +</p>
<p>Women: <span style="text-decoration: line-through">44 kg, 48 kg, 52 kg,</span> 56 kg, 60 kg, 67.5 kg, 75 kg, 82.5 kg, 90 kg, 90 kg +</p>
<p>Here are two sources of inspiration. The first is a short compilation of the greatness that is Randy White. If there is anything you don’t like about this video, send me an email with “ban me” in the subject and go check your ass into the nearest Curves.</p>
<p>The second video is a tutorial that Juli posted on <a href="http://startingstrength.com/resources/forum/showthread.php?t=18310">Starting Strength</a>. It’s me telling you how to make the most of your trip to a Mongolian grill. Justin can vouch for the effectiveness of this. You’ll learn more in this 3-minute clip than you’ll learn at a CF Level I certification.</p>
