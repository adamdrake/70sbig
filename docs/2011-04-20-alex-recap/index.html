  <p><em>Recap written by Mike</em></p>
<p>We started Alex on linear progression back in August/September of last year, and switched his program to a modified Texas method sometime in November. My brother was already quite strong from playing years of football, and started powerlifting with a solid strength base. Since moving down to Texas a couple of months ago, his training has gone quite well, and he has improved his form and strength dramatically. In early March Chris and I suggested that he compete at Texas State with Chris and Brent, and with a little nudge he decided to go for it. A few weeks out we threw some numbers together that seemed pretty conservative, but still gave him the opportunity to see how much stronger he had gotten with a steady training routine, and solid programming. His training going into the meet wasn’t exactly optimal the last few weeks (he recently started a new job, and had to train around his somewhat erratic schedule), but it went well enough where we knew he was going to PR.</p>
<p>Alex wanted to compete at 242, but wasn’t where he needed to be on Friday night. He was 248 that evening, and with less than 12 hours to weigh in, we would’ve had to cut weight in a less than perfect manner. In USAPL you have to weigh in 2 hours prior to lifting if you want any kind of record. And since Alex was going for the bench record for junior raw lifters, he needed to weigh in during that window. We decided that night that if they weren’t going to let him lift as a 275, he would just lift as an extra, but still be able to post a total to qualify for nationals. He was pissed he couldn’t break the 242 bench record, but in the morning we realized he could break the 275 bench record for juniors that Chris set last year. Yea, Alex was going to try and break Chris’s record (the led to some amusing banter between them).</p>
<p>After sitting around all day at the meet, both Alex and Chris were definitely restless. It was both boring and irritating just sitting on a stage in the meet facility, and staring off into space, occasionally getting up to watch Brent lift, or someone else lifting that interested them. We obviously wanted to be there to support Brent; otherwise they would have left to go back to the hotel until they started lifting at “1”. 1 is in quotations because in USAPL time that means they’ll start lifting at “5”.</p>
<p>Once we realized that the first session was over, the room quickly cleared. There were then only a handful of people left in the room watching (I would later mention to Chris “this makes sense, everyone leaves once the strongest people start lifting”). Once the second session began, it was a total cluster**** trying to figure out when everyone was lifting. Eventually (during the second attempts of the first flight) it was established that Chris and Alex would be lifting in the third flight. Much like before, I started having them warm up towards the end of the first flight’s second attempts. This “theoretically” should have given them a lot of time to warm up. Somehow, the second flight went ridiculously fast (it honestly seemed like five minutes) and in no time Alex was 5 out, and Chris was 10 out. WTF. Guess what ? Alex had one warm up left, and Chris had two. In between getting Alex ready for his first attempt, I was still trying to get Chris to warm up, and have some time before his first squat (he honestly had about a minute). About two minutes after Alex’s last warm up, the bar was loaded for his first attempt. If I wasn’t freaking out before this, I was now. I would have been incredibly pissed at myself had their openers looked hard.</p>
<p>Alex opened at 232.5K (513lbs) and smoked it, easy money. Alex doubled 510lbs in training, so I knew this would be easy, despite having no rest between his last warm up and opening attempt. We stuck with the plan, and went for 242.5K (535lbs). Unfortunately, due to fatigue, it was a hard lift. Alex dropped his chest, and that was enough to make it a grinder. The plan was initially to go for 250k (551lbs), but instead we opted for 247.5K (546lbs). Alex kept his chest up as much as he could for this, but I think he was just out of gas. The combination of decreased calories a few days out, and a long day before actually getting to squat was just too much. However he will absolutely destroy this weight, and more at Nationals.</p>
<p>The bench press has always been a strong lift for Alex. If I recall correctly he benched 315lbs as a sophomore in high school. The goal here was to break Chris’s record from the year prior, when Chris competed as a junior. Alex is almost 24, but had time to compete in one competition as a junior. Alex’s bench attempts were pretty uneventful, they were all super easy. I was happy to see him break the junior bench record, but he probably could’ve benched at least 10 pounds more. The point of this meet was to get Alex used to competing though, and he performed very well. His attempts were 147.5K(325lbs), 157.5K(347lbs), and 165K (363lbs). He blew them all up. However, on the last attempt, I wanted to strangle him. Why? His last bench was so easy, that he nearly missed the rack command. He racks it as the judge is saying “rrrrrrrraaaaaaaaa” and thankfully it was timed perfectly. Had he racked it any faster, I’m sure he would’ve been furious to see three red lights. Thankfully, he got the lift, and we moved on to the deadlift.</p>
<p>The deadlift is not Alex’s favorite lift, but he has been progressing well with it. When he first got down to Texas a couple months back, Chris, Alex, and I all went to work on his form. Chris and I agreed that Alex was keeping his butt too low, and needed to be a little more horizontal. With some tweaking, he ended up pulling much bigger weights with much less trouble. There was plenty of time to warm him up for the deadlift, and I used all the time that I could. Once he walked out to the platform for his first attempt, which was his last warm up, he was ready to go. He opened with a jokingly easy 195k(430lbs), and went for 215k(474lbs) on his second attempt. Again, it was a joke. The goal here was 500lbs though, and we stuck with the plan. We went for 227.5K(501lbs) and I briefly toyed with the idea of bumping it up some more, given how easy his second attempt was. I remained cautious though, as I wanted Alex to hit 500lbs for the first time, and remain confident for Nationals. It was an easy lift, and this will definitely help him gain even more confidence as he prepares for Nationals in August.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an awesome first meet for Alex, and I’m very proud of him. Thankfully he had seen me compete at Military Nationals only a few weeks prior, so he knew how things would go. This meet only made him hungry for more training, and I’m sure he’ll do awesome in August.</p>
