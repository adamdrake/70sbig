  <p><em>Recap by Mike</em></p>
<p>We woke up and made it to the meet around 6:45am. Although this wouldn’t be the case for the rest of the day, everything went quite smooth. Brent, Alex, and Chris all weighed in, got their racks heights, and had their equipment checked in, in the span on 20 minutes. We were back outside heading to Cracker Barrel (two minutes from the meet), by 7:10am. Brent and I scoped out the area the night prior (something Justin suggested we do at our first meet in 2010), and had a backup plan as well, just in case things didn’t go well. Thankfully they did, and we had plenty of time for a solid breakfast. I don’t know why, but the Cracker Barrels that I had eaten prior to moving to Texas are not nearly as good as their restaurants here. All of us ate a hearty meal, and Brent knocked over the lamp at the table, and in made a dramatic crash on the ground. Mission accomplished, we left another restaurant in better shape than when we got there. We arrived back around 8:30am for the “rules brief” which was mainly so that we could clarify if we would get yelled at again about not having our thumbs around the bar while squatting. They told us they didn’t care. For the next thirty minutes we tried to figure out what the flights were, and then it was announced that there were two sessions. This meant Alex and Chris lifted in the afternoon. AWESOME.</p>
<p>The lifting began around 9:15a.m, and since Brent was in the third flight it was still going to take a minute. Brent started warming up during the 2nd attempts of the 2nd flight. Brent felt and looked really good, and although he hadn’t squatted more than 435 or 440 since he dropped to 165, I was confident he’d be good to match his previous 210k (463lbs) PR. This would also break the state record, which had been 457. Once Brent was warm, he sat down around 10 minutes out from his first attempt. I’d like to point out now that in a normal setting, Brent is hard to handle. During the meet however, he was quite calm, and doesn’t really display much emotion. I again reiterated to him that he didn’t have a soul.</p>
<p>We went as planned and had Brent opened with a conservative 190k (419lbs). It was an easy first attempt, but not the best bounce I’ve ever seen out of him. He’s normally quite explosive, so I told him about this, and wasn’t even told to f*** off. We jumped up to 200k (441lbs) and sat him down. It took quite a while to get through the countless geared high school lifters, but we eventually got to Brent’s second attempt. It looked slightly better than the first attempt, but still a little bit of a grinder. Although I thought it would be hard, this was Brent, and I was confident he would deliver on the third attempt. He knew it would be hard, but as long as he stuck with it, it was going to go. We called for an attempt to break the state record for 165 pound raw males, and went for 210k (463lbs). Brent walked it out (much faster than he used to, even when he was heavier), and got a solid bounce out of the bottom. He knew it would have to stick with it if he didn’t want a repeat of Nationals (he missed 215k last year), and nailed it. Brent had a BS red light for his underwear last year at Texas State, then missed 215k last year, so this was the first time he went 3/3 on the squat.</p>
<p>There was going to be a lot of time before Brent benched, so we left for Jack n the Box to get a midday meal, which would unfortunately be our last until nearly 12 hours later. After recreating Terminator 2 while standing there waiting for our food (the woman there was amused, and I say that because at least she didn’t call the cops) we headed back. It took us forty minutes to take a 3 minute drive to get food. When we got back, the first flight was just finishing benching, as I expected. There was plenty of time for Brent to eat before he started warming up for the Bench. He made a comment about “I don’t f*<strong>*</strong> need high fructose corn syrup” but otherwise sat and ate quietly. It’s probably a good idea to mention now that Brent strained his right shoulder recently, and was doing a number of mobility wods each time to try and ensure he could recover as fast as possible. He told me it felt pretty good after warming up, so we decided to stick with the plan. We opened at a conservative 112.5k (248lbs), and Brent blew it up, easy style. You’ll appreciate his commentary after the lift, but it was still easy. We bumped it up 10k to 122.5k (270lbs) and he grinded through it. It was tougher than I expected, but Brent told me he really didn’t think we push driving with his heels. We decided to still go for a personal PR, and went for 127.5k (281 lbs). Much like we’ve all felt before, the bar just wasn’t going anywhere; Brent was out of gas for 281lbs. I know he was disappointed, but this was a much leaner Brent Kim (165 vs his previous 181) and I’m confident he’ll be good for 300lbs shortly. My goal was just to focus on the deadlift.</p>
<p>Brent admitted he was quite tired so I sent Alex and Chris to get all of us some frappes from McDonald’s, and get outside for a bit. When they got back 30 minutes later they seemed more frustrated than before (the opposite of what I wanted), and the coffee was straight dog crap. Brent started warming up shortly after, and around 315 I noticed the bar was coming away from him. I’ll go ahead and attribute it to fatigue, but regardless, I knew he needed that cue when it came to making sure he hit all three deadlifts. Much like Justin had me do at Military Nationals, we opened with Brent’s last warm-up of 180k (397lbs), to get a feel for the bar on the platform. The first attempt looked easy, and we went with the planned jump to 195k (430lbs). The bar came away from Brent on this one, and it was a tough lift. Although it was hard, I wanted Brent to go for a little more, and I knew if he kept it close he’d have it. We decided on 200k (441lbs) as opposed to the 205k (452lbs) we had planned for. Brent got a little livelier for this one, but I knew for sure he didn’t want to miss anything else. 441lbs was on the bar, and there was never a doubt he had it. Brent kept the bar much closer on this pull, and it looked far easier than 441lbs. Brent ended up going 8/9, and although he wasn’t really impressed, he was 15 pounds lighter, much leaner, and has room to fill out before Nationals. I’m confident he will smash all his PR’s in August, but unfortunately our day was far from over.</p>
