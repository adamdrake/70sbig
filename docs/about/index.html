  <h1 id="what-is-70s-big">What is 70s Big?</h1>
<p>My friend AC and I were walking around the Wichita Falls Athletic Club one day looking at pictures of lifters from “back in the day”. We saw a collection of guys who were simply massive and strong. It made AC shake his head and say, “Man, these guys were 70s Big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it got me thinking.</p>
<p>The physiques of our 70s Big co-captains, powerlifting Doug Young and Olympic lifting Anatoly Pisarenko, didn’t flourish through bodybuilding techniques. No sir; they wanted to be as strong as possible in their respective sports, and as a result they grew to meet such needs. Guys from this time period were big because they were <strong>strong</strong>.  Guys from this time period were 70s Big.</p>
<p>70s Big is synonymous with being strong. It can also be considered the quest of attaining strength and subsequently muscular body weight. The best way to obtain strength is through barbell training, and barbell training means squatting, pressing, deadlifting, cleaning, jerking, and snatching. Period.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people who make it a priority to <em>look</em> like they are strong when they actually aren’t. Strength training yields a muscular, bouldered physique and it is the foundation for a hardy, useful, yet still pleasing aesthetic.</p>
<p>If you’re confused, the following picture is 70s Big:</p>

<p>It’s currently in vogue to have a spindly, thin appearance which is typically accompanied by a low body fat percentage. Regardless of why this has come to be, those who have such an appearance are not very useful. Imagine asking someone of this “stature” to help you move your car out of the road, haul some lumber, or even fend off a potential zombie attack. It simply wouldn’t be feasible.</p>
<p>Thus, the mission statement of 70’s Big is multi-faceted and ever evolving. We aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve strength through barbell training while eating adequate amounts of food</li>
<li>Become big by being strong as opposed to aesthetic focused exercise</li>
<li>Begin a movement against the prevailing wisdom that “looking good” means being emaciated, gaunt, and undernourished (male or female)</li>
<li>Be humble about our own gains of strength while encouraging and teaching others to improve theirs</li>
<li>Honor the lifters of the past who inspire us to become 70’s Big</li>
<li>Test ourselves in competition while encouraging others to take the chance on competing</li>
<li>Teach fundamentals of strength and conditioning and help athletes or non-athletes implement it into their training</li>
<li>Help push the campaign that strength training makes women healthy and beautiful</li>
<li>Establish the importance of strength training in an exercise, health, or fitness program</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this website provides a good mix of quality information regarding strength training and entertainment. If you ever have any thoughts, comments, or questions, you can <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">e-mail me</a>.</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p>**What is 70’s Big? **</p>
<p>70’s Big is many things.</p>
<p>It is a source for mostly objective knowledge on training, mobility, recovery, rehab, anatomy, strength and conditioning, Olympic weightlifting, raw powerlifting, fitness, military/LEO training, and more. It is a website where like-minded people congregate to learn and talk about training, amuse each other, network, and hang out. It is a mindset that puts a premium on setting goals and intensely attacking them with grit, determination, and consistency. It is a physical prowess of muscularity achieved through strength training instead of aesthetic or vanity training. It is a community that welcomes all with support. 70’s Big is an idea put into your mind that you have the ability to be great, but you first need to believe it and then work for it. Oh, and we’re assholes.</p>
<p>**What isn’t 70’s Big? **</p>
<p>70’s Big is not a place that solely plays on your emotions, gender role, or “better than thou” belief. It isn’t a catch phrase turned into a brand turned into a product turned into money for the site creator. It isn’t trying to be the next big thing on your gym wall and isn’t buying support. It won’t ban you when you disagree and it doesn’t feed you generic bullshit information over and over.</p>
<p>70’s Big doesn’t want disciples or drones who follow it without question — it prefers readers who think for themselves with a healthy skepticism. 70’s Big doesn’t have a primary mission to make money, but to educate. 70’s Big doesn’t intend to annoy, though it will occasionally offend sensitive people (which is actually good for them).</p>
<p><strong>How is 70’s Big different?</strong></p>
<p>There’s less bullshit. The concept of this site has been copied several times, but I maintain the original mission set in helping people train and have a good time doing it. Programming strength and conditioning is not black and white, and one size does not fit all. Training is a life-long pursuit, and we’ll help you with it. We aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>What is the 70’s Big Program?</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t one. Instead, 70’s Big aims to teach people how to program for themselves or others. I — Justin, the owner and editor of 70’s Big — have created hundreds of programming templates, but I insist on teaching the fundamental information of strength and conditioning instead of stock programs that people follow without question. Think of it as teaching people how to fish.</p>
<p><strong>I have a question about…?</strong></p>
<p>****Have you searched this website? We are working on improving the organization of the site. If the search bar doesn’t work well, go to Google and type your search terms followed by “site:70sbig.com” to search this site exclusively. Chances are that your question was asked in the past. And if you’re asking a question about a program that I have written a book on, then consider buying the book. Or not, whatever. We’ll try to help when we can.</p>
<p><strong>Show me something cool.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chalk floats softly through the air. The thumping of your heart is all you hear, all you feel. You step to the bar and place your hands on it, feeling the cold knurling on callused hands. The whirling hurricane of emotion settles into the eye of the storm, that peaceful moment when you have to make the decision to begin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How often do you post?</strong></p>
<p>I used to post every week day, but now I have a job that prevents me from doing so. The goal is to have one article come out on Monday as well as the PR Friday post. We’re always working on new content.</p>
<p>**Who runs the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a>? **</p>
<p>Mike Battaglino posts stuff throughout the week and I (Justin) try to post some funny, entertaining, or educational stuff when I can. Mike mostly posts on Facebook while Justin will post some additional stuff on the Twitter account as well as respond to tweets.</p>
<p><strong>Who are these other guys I see a lot of?</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of friends that include me, AC, Chris, Brent, Mike, Shawn, and a few others. To explain our relationships and perks would be a complete shit show, but we are funnier and weirder than any of your friends. Oh, and we hate each other.</p>
<p><strong>I’m new here; where do I start?</strong></p>
<p>Ehh, I’m working on that. In the mean time, do your best to search the site. You might have to sift a little bit, but there are plenty of cool things here. As well as speedo pics.</p>
