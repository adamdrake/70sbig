<p>Mike started lifting weights in late 2004 as a means to gain weight before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force.

<p>AC started lifting around 12 years old with his father. After high school he lifted casually in college until he was introduced to Crossfit through Justin, who ran sessions out of the school’s gym. The two met by doing handstand push-ups across from one another, with direct eye contact for the set. The set was to 15. It was really gay, and AC said so. They’ve been mortal enemies since.</p>
<p>After obtaining the Level I CrossFit certification, AC helped coach at Crossfit Statesboro, a warehouse gym that Justin and friends opened. Emergency appendicitis left AC emaciated, and this led him to focus on strength training and later competitive powerlifting. AC continued to lift and compete while earning his undergraduate degree and Master’s of Science in Kinesiology. While in graduate school, he interned with Georgia Southern University’s strength and conditioning staff and worked with the football, baseball, and soccer teams. His best competition lifts include a 562lb squat, a 391lb bench, and 600lb deadlift.</p>
<p>Since graduating college AC has been coaching people across different areas of life, from mountaineers to high school athletes. He lives in Georgia andstill competes. He dabbles in stencil artwork and is a gigantic Star Trek fan.</p>
