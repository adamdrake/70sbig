<p>I’m a bit late posting because we got in late last night from doing a barbell seminar in Denver — a guy needs sleep, ok?</p>
<p>It’s a lot of fun having friends who are strong, and my good friend AC is one of those people who is pain-in-the-ass strong. He’s on the brink of plateauing in his linear progression. Yesterday he squatted 450 for three sets of five, pressed 212 for three sets of five, and a few weeks ago deadlifted 500 for five…all at a bodyweight of 205. Oh, and he’s 20 years old.</p>
<p>Since he has pretty much linearly progressed his deadlift, I gave him the green light to work up to a 1RM yesterday. Keep in mind that he squatted and pressed the previously mentioned numbers before pulling this.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7037665">A.C. Max Out</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user802431">A.C.</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>He missed 575 at the knees after that last attempt. AC will start competing in powerlifting and eventually weightlifting. He’s also a pretty good coach, so if you’re in the Atlanta area and want some coaching, <a href="mailto:ac@70sbig.com">e-mail him</a>. You can also find him in south Georgia when he’s at school.</p>
<p>AC is also the one who edits the Rippetoe interview videos, and here is part 7 of the 70’s Big Interview with Rip:</p>
