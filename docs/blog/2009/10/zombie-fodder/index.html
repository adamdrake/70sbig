<p>70’s Big will always take a stand against conventional fitness wisdom and the fitness industry. It is a money oriented industry that thrives on selling a shortcut to emaciation. Being skinny with abs is just not impressive nor productive. This demographic will fall early and fast when the inevitable zombie outbreak occurs.</p>
<p>Face it, the following video is full of guys that are doomed to be zombie fodder:</p>
<p>Wow, that was a lot of underweight guys who probably wear skinny jeans. Surely those non-adult-males could have made better money as an extra in a porno or something (you know, like a guy eating a sandwich in the background…they needed one anyway). And the device itself is…inadequate. I can get plenty of exercise for the “hand shandy muscles” on my own, thank you.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>Today is the day that you get acquainted with <strong>Ricky Bruch</strong>. In short, the guy is fucking insane. It’s hard to glean any interesting information, because all the juicy stuff is just hearsay. From what I found in my “research” (which consisted of YouTube and eating snacks) is that he is a Swedish discus thrower who won a bronze medal in the 1972 Olympic Games. However, a steroid fiasco kept him out of further competition, and this pissed Ricky off. A lot. He trained like an absolute madman (which you’ll see in the video below), and proceeded to throw the discus between 3 and 5 meters further than the current world record (unofficial sources vary with the distance). After he stopped taking steroids, there are reports that he took about 750 vitamin pills a day while improving his performance even more.</p>
<p>If anybody has any sources on him, or they own his documentary/biography called <em>The Soul Is Greater Than the World</em>, let me know. It’s supposed to be very inspiring because of his undying motivation to get better. He has the perfect equation of</p>
<p>Beard + Mustache + Strong + Big + Intense Training + Insanity</p>
<p>Our kinda guy.</p>
<p>The following video has some clips of him training. It gets good around the 2:00 minute mark. If you are short on time, and only want to see him freak out, then go to the 3:00 minute mark. Lots of yelling.</p>
<p>After that first video above, we had to double up on the testosterone. Thanks Ricky.</p>
