At 70’s Big I have always encouraged people to compete in something so that training can be pinpointed to a goal. Competing is a lot of fun, it makes training more interested, and it gives you more of a sense of purpose than just exercising (which is what you do if you say, “I just want to get better at everything, tee hee!">

<p>“Why not? I’m a Terminator.”</p>
<p>At 70’s Big I have always encouraged people to compete in something so that training can be pinpointed to a goal. Competing is a lot of fun, it makes training more interested, and it gives you more of a sense of purpose than just exercising (which is what you do if you say, “I just want to get better at everything, tee hee!”).</p>
<p>Well, if you ever were interested in competing in the barbell sports (powerlifting or weightlifting), then you better get acquainted with the rules.</p>
<p>USA Powerlifting (<a href="http://www.usapowerlifting.com/index.shtml" target="_blank">USAPL</a>) is a member of the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF). Their rule book is found <a href="http://usapowerlifting.com/lifterscorner/USAPLHandbook2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>USA Weightlifting (<a href="http://weightlifting.teamusa.org/" target="_blank">USAW</a>) is a member of the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF). Their rule book is found <a href="http://weightlifting.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/4688/USAW_TECHNICAL__DOPING_RULES_as_of_November_2008.doc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to become acquainted with the rules so that you don’t have a booboo in a meet. Kinda like Jacob did on his third attempt squat…</p>
<p>Nevertheless, nice job, Jacob. I will let him recap the meet in the comments.</p>
