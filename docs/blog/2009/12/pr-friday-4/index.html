<p>PR Friday, people! This is where you will post the week’s accomplishments in lifting, eating, or gaining body weight. If you lift over the weekend, write your PR’s here anyway (as opposed to Monday’s post).</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>On the back-end of this website, I am able to go in and see who is linking to us. We’ve been linked to from a lot of places; from Washington state to Europe. 70’s Big makes an appearance on a lot of forums and it’s kinda funny to see the random criticism for the site, because usually it doesn’t make much sense.</p>
<p>The biggest misconception is that we are claiming that you eat an asinine amount of food for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! ARRGGGHHHHH! Look, <strong>there is no 70’s Big diet</strong>. The main thing we are concerned about is that you are eating enough to sustain getting stronger and bigger for your training goals, and we hope that those goals include some kind of competition.</p>
<p>It just so happens to be that the majority of people who are reading this site need to gain around 50 pounds of body weight just to be useful. Guys and girls like this — yes, lots of girls are underweight, albeit not 50 pounds underweight — need to get lots of calories in along with the mandatory protein. Will they gain a little bit of bodyfat? Potentially, but usually it is insignificant if they are training hard.</p>
<p>I am going to say this really obnoxiously because everyone always misses this important fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOBODY IS SUGGESTING THAT YOU EAT A BAG OF TRAIL MIX, ICE CREAM WITH MAGIC SHELL, AN EXTRA LARGE PIZZA TOPPED WITH OLIVE OIL, AND EGG NOG FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I AM suggesting that you do this if you need to gain muscular body weight, and I AM saying that you need to do this if you are skinny and want to get stronger. Once you achieve an appropriate weight, then you will eat to maintain that mass while fueling your recovery. Quit misconstruing what I say or what this site stands for. I just want you strong, and if you are small, you need to do things in order to get bigger and stronger.</p>
<p>Bigger guys (230+) can probably get away with a Paleo-type diet that includes milk and dairy. Bigger guys will require lots more food to meet protein and caloric requirements, and even more so when they are lifting lots of weight on a regular basis. You people that don’t strength train have to understand that the nutritional requirements change when you are placing a lot of stress on your body. Things don’t affect you in the same way that they do when you are an “exerciser” or a lazy person.</p>
<p>70’s Big is most inspiring to the skinny kid who needs a kick in the ass to eat like a 220 pound guy would instead of a 150 pound child. But this website also serves anybody who is wanting to get stronger. The fact is that everybody has a unique situation, but we are all the same in that we want to be stronger today than we were yesterday. There are no absolutes but getting stronger.</p>

<p>Since we are talking about it, here is a food plan that I made for my buddy Cliff to help him push from 200 to 220. Cliff weighed around 175 when he started lifting here, and got up to 220 while working a full time job. He figures he will make a push to 240 after the city league basketball season. This picture appeared a few months ago, and I consider it a classic.</p>

<p>Note: I made a mistake with what I refer to as the <a href="/?p=908">Facebook Fiasco</a>. I stated that I wanted you guys to identify yourselves if you want friendship on Facebook, and then I got a stupid amount of friend requests. I’ve since decided that I won’t be accepting any of this fubar unless I actually know you. Sorry, but it makes things easier to manage, and it ensures that I won’t A) be murdered in the middle of the night or B) subject to awkward bromances. Females are still welcome.</p>
