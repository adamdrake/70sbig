  <p><em>The following is a post by Gary Gibson, a friend and contributor on the Starting Strength forums.</em></p>
<p>At 5’10″ and a little over 160 lbs, I used to cling to the absurd notion that I was somehow past quick “newbie” gains. You see, about 15 years ago I graduated from college at my full adult height and weighing only around 130 lbs. This looked as frighteningly malnourished as you imagine. I wondered why women didn’t take me seriously as a potential mate even though I had a dazzling smile and a razor sharp eight-pack.</p>
<p>I spent the next decade squatting deeply, but with poor form. My overall programming was even worse and I fell under the sway of nonsense like HIT and partial-rep training. About five years ago, I convinced myself that I “just wasn’t built to squat and bench press” and dedicated myself to the deadlift, various overhead presses and chin ups. I also got into learning the full versions of the Olympic lifts even though I was only about 150 lbs with a shaky 245-lb squat to legal depth.</p>
<p>About three years ago, I recognized my scrawny nonsense for what it was when I had a confrontation with a much larger guy in my construction job and had to back down because I realized that I was grossly outsized and outmatched, despite being able to full squat snatch my own bodyweight.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, I started taking the squat seriously again and got it up to 315 lbs while I hit a bodyweight of 160 lbs. About a year after that I entered my first powerlifting competition and squatted 347 lbs with just a belt and knee sleeves in the 75 kg class. I thought I’d done pretty well considering how light and weak I had always been. I convinced myself that I couldn’t possibly gain much more weight and that at best I’d get a bit stronger in my current weight class and then that would be it.</p>
<p>By this time I’d read Starting Strength and started frequenting Rip’s online forum. I kept hearing about this GOMAD stuff, but just didn’t think it applied to me. After all, I’d been training properly for at least a couple of years and had gotten over three wheels on the squat! But Rip told me something that really stuck with me: “At your height you have to weigh 198 at least to be a competent powerlifter.”</p>
<p>198? Just didn’t seem possible. But I’d been bitten by the powerlifting bug and really wanted to get as big and strong as I could. So I started buying several gallons of milk at a time and dedicating myself to drinking a gallon each day.</p>
<p>I’d gotten as high as the mid-170s with a 405-lb squat, but then I cut weight for what was supposed to be my third meet in December 2009. This decision came after a lot of deliberation. At my level, getting bigger and stronger should supersede making weight classes. Ironically the meet got canceled because of a snowstorm that crippled the entire region. I got down to 164, but I lost a lot of strength. This proved to be a perfect chance to prove the power of GOMAD and squats.</p>
<p>A week after the meet cancellation I embarked on a program of volume squats and bench presses, fueled by GOMAD. Almost exactly one month later I am 20 lbs heavier than that low of 164 and my 5RM squat has become the weight I use for sets of five across. Let me make that clear: I was 164 lbs last month with a max squat of around 370; one month later I’m 184 lbs and am on track to a max squat of around 440. Will I actually squat 440 or more? Well, I could barely squat 335 for five last month and last night I used that weight for six sets of five…and the cycle isn’t even half over. You can keep track of my progress by reading my log on the Starting Strength site.</p>
<p>To be big and strong I need to weigh at least 200 lbs at this height with a final goal around 220. I wonder how many other skinny minnies are malingering in gyms across the world, crying about skinny wrists and hard gaining. Funny thing is, I still don’t look “big”–and I’m far from 70’s Big–despite a 20% increase in overall mass. I have to shake my head in disbelief when I imagine myself at 5’10″ and 150 lbs and thinking that that was Just Fine. 150 lbs is just fine…if you’re 5’4″. If you’re a male of the average 5’8″ to 5’10″, you need to weigh around 200 lbs if you want to be strong. You need to squat, eat big, and drink your GOMAD.</p>
<p>If you’re starting out at 150 and under, then the eating big and the GOMAD can be scary and uncomfortable. It’s going to seem like your gut’s getting way to big for your skinny little limbs. But stick with it. Once your gut is full and round, your body will take this as a sign that it has the reserves to support growth. You will not grow if your body “thinks” it is in permanent semi-starvation mode. So eat big, drink your GOMAD and keep upping your squat.</p>
