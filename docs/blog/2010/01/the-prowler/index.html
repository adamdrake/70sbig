<p>We recorded a video talking about The Prowler sled from <a href="http://elitefts.com/">Elite FTS</a>. I don’t really remember what we said about it in the video, but if I recorded the video now, I’d say that it is the PREMIER conditioning tool for the strength athlete.</p>
<p>The more I think about how to use The Prowler, the more I’m impressed. You can literally attack any part of the energy systems continuum by varying the weight and work/rest ratio. Put a medium amount of weight on, and do sprint repeats. Put a light amount of weight on and push it a long distance. Put a whole lot of weight on and push it a short distance. Vary the speed in all of those examples. And I’m not even scratching the surface.</p>
<p>The thing is versatile is hell, and now I have people using it on a regular basis. Kyle, a 15 year old weightlifter that I coach, gave some good insight after using The Prowler for the first time; “They should take people in prison and duct tape their hands to the prowler then release rabid dogs to chase them.” Crime rates would plummet since The Prowler is definitely an ass kicker.</p>
<p>Rip bought the Econo Prowler, which is a less expensive version of the original Prowler. You can read about it, see some videos, and see a review <a href="http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?cid=390&amp;m=PD&amp;pid=2294">here</a>. Again, I’ve never met anybody from Elite FTS, and nobody asks me to endorse anything (c’mon, this audience isn’t that big), but if I were going to have another tool in addition to a bar, plates, and rack, this would be it.</p>
