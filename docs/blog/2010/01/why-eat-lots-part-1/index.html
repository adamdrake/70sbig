  <h2 id="why-eat-lots">Why Eat Lots?</h2>
<p>Part 1 – The Conceptual Understanding</p>
<p>I realize a lot of you are new to all of this. You are possibly new to strength training and eating in order to recover from that training as well as increasing muscular body weight. Even if you have been involved in some kind of training, you may still be new to what we recommend on this website. It’s okay.</p>
<p>Let’s pretend you work in an office building and you have to make managerial decisions. Construction needs to occur in half of the building so that the plumbing can be fixed along with the installation of a network infrastructure to make things more efficient. Everybody that works for you gets moved to the other half of the building, and both guys and girls have to use the same toilet. Do you think it would be logical if I came up to you and said, “Uh…<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Dp_DMAQAg">Mr. Lumbergh</a>? I have to poop a lot, and now the women will always smell it for the rest of my life because they will forever share a bathroom with me. Please ignore the fact that my overuse of toilet paper is why we are fixing the plumbing in the first place.”</p>
<p>Assuming Lumbergh doesn’t can your ass on the spot, he is going to have to remind you that A) you brought this on yourself since you ruined the plumbing, B) this is obviously not a permanent thing since the other half of the building will open up after construction is over, and C) the entire office will run more smoothly after the new infrastructure installation, so just fucking deal with it. Yeah…</p>
<p>Look, when I tell you to eat lots of food so that you can not only satisfy the necessary protein and caloric requirements for training, but also an excess of both to stimulate new tissue growth, I’m not telling you to do this for the rest of your life. Why do you suddenly think I am recommending that everyone should ALWAYS eat triple bacon cheeseburgers and a bowl of ice cream with magic shell and brownies?</p>
<p>The terms don’t change. If you are fat or skinny, you have done something to make yourself fat or skinny. You have to do something different if you want a different result. Since the majority of both guys and girls are underweight and weak, they will have to train and eat more to get stronger and bigger. Since stronger is better, they need to do this ASAFP.</p>
<p>It is implied that you will no longer look like a skinny, useless human after getting stronger. This is the point. Emaciation is in vogue and stylish, and we aim to put an end to this societal quirk. The skinnier and more weightless you are, the more extreme your eating can and will be to make the most efficient gains. If you are a competitor and train very hard, you will need to eat even more to recover from your training.</p>

<p><strong>Thing #1:</strong> You brought this on yourself by being weak and probably skinny in the same way that the guy in the story ruined the plumbing with his belligerent bowel movements.</p>
<p>If you aim to get as strong as possible in the most efficient amount of time — which would be the sensible use of your training time and resources — then you will inconvenience yourself with eating lots of food so that you recover and GROW.</p>
<p><strong>Thing #2:</strong> You must make the sacrifice to change your habits to achieve results that are different than where you started. The guy in the story was unhappy with the women in his building inhaling his acrid aroma, but he is going to have to deal with it during this period of change — ESPECIALLY because it is his fault in the first place.</p>
<p>There is no reason you have to continue eating sloppy in the event you reach an appropriate body weight for your frame. This would be irresponsible and ill-advised in the long-term. Even though you are gaining muscle and fat, the majority of it will be muscle if you are training and eating correctly. Correctly means following a program (the novice linear progression from <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=312&amp;action=show_detail">Starting Strength</a> always produces results if properly followed), and proper eating means eating a quantity of protein that corresponds with your desired weight (1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight) as well as enough calories to recover and increase body weight.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that by doing this, you are gaining both strength and muscular body weight. The strength increase is the whole point and is universally useful (Note: especially in zombie survival scenarios). So what if you lose your abs? <strong>Abs were not meant to be concave</strong>. Besides, when you hit that appropriate body weight, you can adjust your diet so that body fat can be reduced. However, care must be taken that body weight is not lost — it’s obvious that a 230 pound man must eat differently than a 150 pound boy.</p>
<p><strong>Thing #3:</strong> The goal is to gain strength, and this is ultimately useful. In the story above, the guy overlooks the fact that his office building will be much more efficient with the new infrastructure. This is analogous to your body functioning better with whatever it is you are trying to do. All athletic qualities are increased and augmented (automatically or through practice and conditioning), you will live longer, and you can wow your friends by tossing small children over houses.</p>
<p>In Part 2 tomorrow I will talk about why the majority of you are wasting your time when you worry about the health considerations for eating to grow.</p>
