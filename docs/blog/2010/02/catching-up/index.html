<p>I commend some of you for not only answering questions in the comments over the weekend but also defending against a few ridiculous statements from certain posters. It is easy to take anything that we say out of context or incorrectly assume it applies to every spectrum of the population. As this website grows, there will continue to be ridiculous comments and/or trolls. As a general rule, these intellectual children can be ignored.</p>

<p>A new t-shirt order will be in stock shortly. Also, I am working on a couple of other interesting designs. Stay tuned.</p>
