Ladies and gentlemen who are on your quest to 70’s Bigdom, I am excited (physically or emotionally, I can’t tell) to announce the advent of the 70’s Big Workshop.
This interactive lecture style formatted workshop will include material that teaches a coach or trainee how to get 70’s Big along with a butt load of training material that you can only obtain from a knowledgeable coach or through years of experience — in other words, the little things that make a big difference in your training.">

<p>Ladies and gentlemen who are on your quest to 70’s Bigdom, I am excited (physically or emotionally, I can’t tell) to announce the advent of the <strong>70’s Big Workshop</strong>.</p>
<p>This interactive lecture style formatted workshop will include material that teaches a coach or trainee how to get 70’s Big along with a butt load of training material that you can only obtain from a knowledgeable coach or through years of experience — in other words, the little things that make a big difference in your training.</p>
<p>While we could host the first workshop at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club, I figured I would make it more accessible to Dallas/Fort Worth by coming to the area. However, this requires a willing gym, hence this message. If you own or are part of a gym in the DFW area and are interested in hosting this brand new workshop, <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">e-mail me</a> (there is something in it for the gym owner).</p>
<p>Also: yes I am interested in other areas within driving distance of Wichita Falls — east, west, and south Texas, Oklahoma, etc.</p>
