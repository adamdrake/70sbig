  <p>Some of you are probably wondering why the site isn’t updated. Well, the site got moved over to another server, so anything that was posted since the database was pulled is not currently here. That means some of the comments that some of you posted won’t be here, and that also means that the post I wrote last night (like a frickin’ bonehead — I forgot about the database) are not up.</p>
<p>The good news is that the apostrophe problem is now nonexistant. On the old server, when you typed a single right quote mark, as in the word don’t, it would show up as don”t. For some reason that could not be fixed on the old server, and it also prevented newer versions of Word Press to be installed. In any case, now I don’t have to type in the HTML manually for a single right quote, and you don’t have to be irritated by it in the comments.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
<p>_Edit: I’m just going to wait until tomorrow to post.</p>
