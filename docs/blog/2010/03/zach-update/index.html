  <p>The internet is such a goofy place. I have a friend here at the gym who has gained 78 pounds in the time that he has been here. He walked in one night at 164 pounds and said he wanted to get bigger and stronger. Usually you don’t know if a guy like that is serious or not, yet I taught him the lifts and gave him the low down on eating. He has gained lots of weight and a decent amount of strength, yet there are people on the internet who refuse to believe this. I don’t know, maybe they think Rippetoe is lying, as if fabricating a fake story about a guy gaining a lot of weight is something that he is into.</p>
<p>In any case, here is the data. Rip, an experienced bodyfat caliper user (he has owned a gym for 30+ years), did a 7 site pinch test on Zach to measure his bodyfat. Here is the data (you can find Rip’s post about it here):</p>
<p><em>Note: The following is a comparison of the progress Zach has made in the last 15 weeks. He has been lifting here for about six months.</em></p>

<p>Zach has gained almost 80 pounds, and right under 60% of that is muscle. If he wanted to, he could lose the bodyfat that he currently holds, but the last I heard, he was pushing towards 275. The conversation went like this a few months ago,</p>
<p>“So what are your goals?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Other than getting stronger, I dunno. I guess I’ll weigh 275.”</p>
<p>“Cool.”</p>
<p>Zach is not unhealthy right now. Sure, the larger he gets, the harder it will be to complete endurance efforts, but endurance efforts are not a measure of health. Eating to grow for x amount of time is not going to negatively affect long-term health. Furthermore, eating in a manner that skinny people consider “un-clean” when you are training hard will not produce health complications in a normal person.</p>
<p>But a very important point is that the first time Zach ever benched 225 or squatted 300, he did it for a set of five. And that is what matters to him.</p>
