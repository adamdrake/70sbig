  <p>‘Tis PR Friday lads and lasses, and that means you get to post your personal records in lifting, clothing ripped, eating, and bodyweight increases. I just saw someone ferociously rip their shorts when they were squatting yesterday. It brought a tear to my eye.</p>
<p>Oh, and the <a href="http://twitter.com/70sBig">70’s Big Twitter page</a> was just launched. We’ll try to make it funny.</p>

<p><strong>Greetings!</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been shipping out the t-shirt orders and there have been a bunch of orders from around the world; Ireland, the UK, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, and Australia all contain people who are on the quest to 70’s Big. I’d like to personally extend a greeting to all of the international readers and welcome you all to post in the comments this weekend to drop us a line. I’ve never been out of the U.S., so this is particularly fascinating to be reaching anybody across the world.</p>

<p><strong>The Mustaches of May Contest</strong></p>
<p>Starting in May 70’s Big will have a picture contest centered around a particular theme every month. Whoever has the best picture in May will win a 70’s Big t-shirt. The theme of May’s contest is mustaches, so the submitter must include a picture of them wearing some kind of stellar ‘stache. This is open to both males and females, but females are strongly encouraged to not grow a mustache for this event. The mustache doesn’t have to be real, but you’d have to think of something pretty damn clever to win on a fake ‘stache.</p>
<p>Some rules off the top of my head include:</p>
<p>– No male nudity. Ever.</p>
<p>– Female nudity won’t be posted on the site.</p>
<p>– Don’t send me something that is going to piss people off (racial or violent stuff), and if you are doing something religious, it shouldn’t mock the religion but pay homage to it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, just use good sense. Don’t ruin this for everyone else.</p>
