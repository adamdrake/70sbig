<p>PR Friday boys and girls. Post your weights lifted, competitions attended, pants splitted and victory dances performed to the comments. We certainly had lots of PR’s for emotional outbreaks in the comments this week.</p>
<p>The 2010 National Master’s Weightlifting Championships is this weekend in Rego Park, New York. I’d like to wish my friend, Dr. Lon Kilgore, a good luck. He has been competing in Olympic weightlifting since he was 11 years old will be competing this weekend in the 85 kg class at 52 years old. You can see the final schedule <a href="http://www.mastersweightlifting.org/news/2010nat_schedule.htm">here</a> as well as the start list (including names and info on the lifters) <a href="http://www.mastersweightlifting.org/news/2010nat_start_sess.htm">here</a> (Kilgore is lifting in the 8th session). More Masters’ Weightlifting info can be found at their <a href="http://www.mastersweightlifting.org/">home page</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I just realized that USAW recently released the 2010 National Championships <a href="http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/24036/2010_National_Championships_Entry_Form_Final_4.6.10.pdf">Entry Form</a> with the tentative schedule. Check it out if you want to see how a big meet with multiple sessions will be set up, along with all of the legal hoopla that goes into submitting an entry for one of these (who knew you weren’t allow to dope blood?).</p>
<p>The new t-shirts should be finishing up later today or on Monday, and I will give updates as I receive the information.</p>
<p>In the mean time, here is a pretty sweet weightlifting video that has the hair, the style, the drama, and some big lifts:</p>
