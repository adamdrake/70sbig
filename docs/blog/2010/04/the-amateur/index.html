<p>My friend <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/users/Spencer%20Hall">Spencer Hall</a> from SB Nation is known as “The Amateur”, the guy who can’t do anything as good as those who can. Well, recently he shot up to Charlotte to witness his first powerlifting meet. This was the “Battle of the Border” meet that AC competed in a few weekends ago. Spencer <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2010/3/31/1396177/mustache-weekend-part-two-powerlifting">wrote an article</a> for the SB Nation readers who are more than likely not familiar with powerlifting. He highlights AC quite a bit, and there’s a pretty funny video at the end. Even if he didn’t talk about my pal Ace, I still would enjoy this article — Spencer had me laughing my ass off. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately…a mustache <em>[that Spencer is wearing</em>] brands you as:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a.) A gregarious pedophile</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>b.) A new expat from the Middle East</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>c.) A misplaced fisherman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>d.) Nick Offerman, also known as Ron Swanson on NBC’s hit sitcom Parks and Recreation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is an exchange between Spencer and AC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I ask him how much his hair is worth on a lift.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The hair? Oh, that’s ten pounds, easy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The beard is five, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Definitely. And you have to wear the singlet. This one is my dad’s. His balls were in this singlet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He wears a look of pride on his face as he says this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Singlets are cool. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is very fucking funny, and Spencer has a nice little description of an outsider’s view of a powerlifting meet. We’ll probably hear from him again in the future.</p>
