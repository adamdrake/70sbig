  <p>Meet Brian Drescher, a living legend. I stumbled upon YouTube videos of this guy and was pretty entertained. Unfortunately the guy who uploaded his two best videos put a block on embedding them, so you will have to click them manually.</p>
<p>This guy apparently loves him some Olympic weightlifting. When he hits his lifts, he’ll say things like, “In your face! There it is! Still the king!” so fast you wonder how he was prepared to say it while supporting 100 kilos overhead. The guy must be crazy like <a href="/?p=431">Ricky Bruch</a>, but generally has a jovial disposition (as opposed to Bruch’s ill-tempered nature).</p>
<p>The first video I saw was this one at the 2007 Empire State Games, and it gives you a splash of his personality.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the YouTube account doesn’t allow links to the videos. You can find the account <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/djquntsntl">here</a>, and it is the 2007 Empire State Games video.</p>
<p>But you’ll learn so much more from him in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpBoyb1X8Q0">this next vid</a> (my personal favorite) — he spits out his life philosophy while doing a set of 10 power snatches at 70 kilos (note the “Got Total?” shirt).</p>
<p>Don’t fret, we also have videos of him competing in the 2008 and 2009 Empire State Games. This is a real treat folks, because he is, after all, an American legend.</p>
