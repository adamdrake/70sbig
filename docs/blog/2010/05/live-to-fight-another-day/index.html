  <p>We all remember that momentous moment in the movie <em>Blood Sport</em> where Chong Li sends Frank Dux’s friend, Ray Jackon, to the hospital on the second day of the highly secretive (and equally illegal) Kurmite:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1j0Loz-JRI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>As you can see, Dux has a front row seat to his friend Ray acting like a stupid American and trying to win the crowd only to find himself getting an Asian curb stomp from Chong Li moments later. On a similar note, Chong Li is probably one of the first Asians to ever have <a href="http://www.completemartialarts.com/whoswho/pictures/images/bolo6.JPG" target="_blank">pecs</a>, and he damn sure is the first one to discover how to use them.</p>
<p>Anyway, Dux’s friend, <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_IL518OY7yDk/ScZexi9LzJI/AAAAAAAAAvA/NQbyJ6QgG5c/s400/cs5.jpg" target="_blank">Kenneth Siu</a> (on right) holds him back while Chong Li strips off the stereotypical Harley Davidson bandana and dangles it above Dux’s head. This isn’t in the official movie script, but I’m pretty sure Kenneth whispers ever so softly into Frank Dux’s ear, “No Frankie, you must live to fight another day…another day.”</p>
<p>And this was excellent advice. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Kumite_bracket.gif" target="_blank">As you can see</a>, Dux would end up fighting four times on the second day of the tournament. A non-sanctioned scuffle with Chong Li would have removed him from competition, and as my friend Brent always says, “This is competition!” (whatever that means).</p>
<p>You see, if Frank Dux had attacked Chong Li at this pivotal point, it not only would have ruined this classic 80’s fight movie, but it would have failed to teach the lesson of patience. There are times when the benefits do not outweigh the cost, and becoming aware of these moments is important for your short and long-term training career. If your body is in a weakened state, it is best not to train heavy and hard unnecessarily.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I did not heed the advice of Kenneth Siu. I traveled back into town on a Monday and attempted to go through my normal volume day on the Texas Method (5×5 squatting, and I think it was 430) on Tuesday. My back was very tired and weak from the constant sitting, and I pulled something at the bottom of a squat on the second set. I remember completing the rep, screaming through the excruciating pain (I wasn’t about to drop the 430 lbs on my spotters), and falling to a knee after racking it. I wasn’t able to squat for almost two months, and it put quite a damper in my training.</p>
<p>Now fast forward to last week. I went through a lengthy rehab process and am finally training without pain. The week before I squatted 495 for a triple, and 500 was on the agenda. However, my body didn’t feel up to snuff for Monday’s volume day. My immune system had some severe trouble with allergies (the crew at Amarillo may have noticed this at the first 70’s Big Workshop – I was being hit pretty hard that day but still tried to perform well enough), and my body didn’t feel recovered. I ended up taking the day off to prevent an injurous situation. I still wanted to get my intensity day in on Thursday for a few reasons, but mainly because it was the last day of the week my schedule would permit me to train. So on Tuesday I had a make shift volume day (ascending sets of five reps for four sets), and then came in on Thursday and completely annihilated 500 for a triple (I considered going for a fourth rep).</p>
<p>This story isn’t being told to tell you of my accomplishment, but instead about the mistake I made a few months ago. I hurt my back when I was in a vulnerable state. Having the “stick to the program or die” mentality can really hamper training, and it fucked mine up for a while. Life happens and you need to start learning how to adapt your program to these happenings so that you can continue getting stronger. You will have a much bigger payoff in the long run, just like Frank Dux.</p>
<p>Dux waited patiently for his chance. And he finally got it when he faced Chong Li in the final battle.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wpVAdA7Oo0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>For those of you who don’t want to watch drawn out affair of Van Damme yelling and flexing, Dux eventually forces Chong Li to say matté to win the tournament, even when blinded (and throwing “90 degree punches”, as Brent says – see 3:07). I have it on good authority that this is the Asian word for “uncle”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: So, is matté the Asian word for uncle?</p>
<p>Brent: I think so.</p>
<p>Me: QED</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, Dux decided to be patient and begin the fight his own terms. If I know my 80’s movies, his emotions would have gotten the best of him had he attacked Chong Li immediately after Ray Jackson headbutted Li’s foot. Dux’s dilemma is analogous to being improperly prepared for training because you are weak and not feeling your best. Trust me, you don’t want to go through a two month recovery period. Just be smart and patient in order to stay injury free, and this will yield more efficient strength gains. Learn from my mistake instead of yours. Most of all, learn from Frank Dux.</p>
