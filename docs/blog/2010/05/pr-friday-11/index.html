  <p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Post your weight lifted, gained, and number of females that you know who can toss “men” around.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>We like 70’s Big readers to get strong. Then we like 70’s Big readers to compete. In something. Well, the Highland Games is an option. Gant competed at one last year, and he’s getting ready to do another this year.</p>
<p>Gant is primarily a judo player these days, but has competed in a lot of stuff (I don’t know, ask him). I have videos of him squatting and pressing from this past week (he’s on the 5/3/1 program) as well as a video of him throwing a shot in preparation of the Highland Games competition he’ll be doing. Make the comparison between his squat, press, and put and report back to us whether you think the strength movements are going to help his throwing or not.</p>
<p>You’ll notice Gant is squatting with a shim under his left foot. He’s got some pelvic problems that require constant adjustment. When squatting on a shim, the imbalance makes it easy for the lifter to drift onto their toes, and you’ll see that a bit here. Oh, and after talking, Gant and I are of the opinion that these squats do look high, but also of the opinion that lots of squats on video look high. He’s a little high on a few, and that’s why I try to yell about it.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xsYgj9bNET8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Funky left elbow/shoulder thing on the last rep of the presses. You’ll see Gant’s displeasure. I also don’t recommend trying to coach and film at the same time. I like my unnecessary “speed” cue in the middle (it’s a good cue if the lifter is doing touch and go, but he wasn’t, and I guess I blurted it out).</p>
<p>**<em>Edit: This is actually 195 for reps.</strong></em></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7DsE83OMHms?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Putting it to practice throwing the shot. Oh, and yes, Gant realizes he won’t be throwing a shot in the Highland Games.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7G4Pks3d-CM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Note: I’ll do something about the narrow width of the site later (I don’t know how to do it myself).</p>
