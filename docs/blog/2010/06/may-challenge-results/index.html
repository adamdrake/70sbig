<p>I took results from everywhere I could find them. Most were in the Challenge thread, but there were a few strays, including a couple friends that posted on my Facebook page.</p>
<p>I have attached a spreadsheet with the results of the May Challenge. The first page is the absolute rankings in each division. The next two pages are ranked by weight class (I used PL classes just because).</p>
<p>The results are interesting. The women up at <a href="http://www.crossfitworks.com/archives/1667">CrossFit Works</a> killed this thing, which is to be expected given their high rep, high volume training with the weights used here. I don’t know Levi’s or Quadzilla’s training background, but they outpaced the open division by 20 reps. Hopefully they’ll chime in here. As for the tanks, powerlifter54 is a very accomplished powerlifter (and a great source of lifting knowledge) who did this during a light week in preparation for a Navy fitness test. I don’t know anything about vandy676 other than he is a large man. Shon P. (I estimated his weight) is a friend of mine who I asked to do this. He ran away with the tank division. I’ll profile him next week, but I’ll leave it to you to guess his training background in the comments.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who participated. Enjoy your June and look for more silliness in July.</p>
<p><em>PS If anyone can tell me how to attach an spreadsheet to WordPress, I’d be glad to do it.</em></p>
