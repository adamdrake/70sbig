<p><strong>Get Your Knowledge On</strong></p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://doctorhartman.blogspot.com/">the blog</a> of Dr. Hartman. I’ll let this quote describe him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Michael Hartman is a Sport Scientist, and recognized expert in training for Strength-Power and Performance. He earned his Doctorate in Muscle Physiology and has previously worked as a Collegiate Strength and Conditioning Coach and Sport Scientist at the US Olympic Training Center where he was a member of the inaugural USA Weightlifting Performance Enhancement Team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Hartman is also friends with Dr. Kilgore (who some of you may be familiar with), and I’ve also heard that he is a very good strategist as a platform coach (this means while he handles lifters at meets). I met him briefly when he was handling Dr. Kilgore at the USAPL Texas State Meet a couple months ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, his blog will cover topics of Strength-Power-Performance, Sport Science, general Strength &amp; Conditioning, as well as current events in the media. Dr. Hartman’s research and practical experience should give us a unique perspective on these topics.</p>
