  <p>Brent’s persona (personality?) is one that isn’t impressed by much. I can’t speak for Brent, but I was impressed by some lifts that occurred at the Junior Worlds in Olympic weightlifting.</p>
<p>In this video, Abti Aukadov snatches 160kg-165kg-170kg at 85kg. That’s pretty damn impressive, especially because he’s 17 years old, but I’m most impressed by his solid overhead position — it never wavers. His pulling motion is also very good. I’m impressed.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAtNCo-fTzg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>A 201kg clean and jerk to follow — these are huge numbers for a 17 year old. I’m impressed. I would expect him to make the trip to London in 2012. Kendrick Farris has his work cut out for him — let’s hope he keeps improving steadily as well!</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWNLqjRKz3M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>The next impressive video is Leidy Solis, a Columbian lifter, clean and jerking 139kg at a 67.4kg body weight. I just want to clarify that 139kg is more than 99% of what you goobers can do (realistically it’s not that far away from me — I plan on pulling away though). That is just damn silly. Oh, and she’s 20 years old. I will have to agree with Brent in liking her intensity as she is coming out of the hole (his words, not mine). I’m impressed.</p>
