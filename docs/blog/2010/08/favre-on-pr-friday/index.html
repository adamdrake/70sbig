  <p><strong>PR FRIDAY – post all KINDS of personal records to the comments, yo.</strong></p>
<p>I played football throughout high school like most guys (that’s American football for you Euro readers), and I played a year in college. The sport of football fits well with this whole attitude thing that 70’s Big has grown into. One player exudes this attitude into the way he plays, and that player is Brett Favre.</p>
<p>Favre is a tough quarterback, likes to compete, comes through in the clutch, and has fun doing it. He’s started over 300 games consecutively — an insane feat that is probably one of the most impressive sport statistics ever. Oh, and he’s coming back for a 20th year.</p>

    Favre seen here NOT wearing under armor

<p>This isn’t news to anyone who casually follows football or the NFL. The sports “media” (code for “annoying bunch of pains in the asses”) have been talking non-stop about whether or not he was going to retire or not because of his surgically repaired ankle. Without any evidence of whether or not he would retire, that maintained priority over most sport networks. I remember seeing the dorky guy with the mustache on ESPN talking to Favre as he sat in his giant diesel truck. The guy was all, “This humidity is making my makeup smear. Do you think there are any scones left in the media van?” and Brett was all, “I’m gonna go edge my lawn and drink a few beers.”</p>
<p>Three weeks ago I predicted that Favre would play this season and he was essentially skipping training camp on purpose. And you know what? I don’t give a damn. He <em>should</em> skip training camp. Why would you want a 40 year old guy having multiple practices a day, stressing his body (that can’t accept the same stress it did five, ten, fifteen, or twenty years ago), adding to his year’s work load when you want him to still make an impact in late January? It’s physiology, folks.</p>
<p>Too much stress would weaken Favre throughout the season. Take into account the ankle surgery — that is another structure in his body that shouldn’t be stressed more than necessary. Guys who have been in the league for 12 or 15 years shouldn’t have to worry about training camp so that they can actually be effective during the season instead of burning out. And don’t try and pull that shit that he “plays quarterback” and the QB doesn’t go through a whole lot of physical trauma. Favre gets his ass kicked on a regular basis, but he gets back up and continues slinging the ball down field. That’s 70’s Big.</p>
<p>I’m rooting for Favre and the Vikings this season. I’m a Browns fan, but we all know how that is gonna end. We’ll be talking about football more, probably about once a week when the season gets underway. It’s a sport that is pretty relevant for us since it involves above average strength, power, speed, and conditioning. Irregardlessly, (a term that is used specifically to troll you) most of us will be talking about it anyway.</p>

<p>_As long as we’re talking football, you may as well watch this. I have to hate Brandon Jacobs because he plays for the Giants, but I have to admire him because he’s…Brandon Jacobs.</p>
