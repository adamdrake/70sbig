  <p>Cooking has become increasingly popular over the years on television, and it has branched throughout the internet. I’d like to share two websites, <a href="http://bargainbites00.blogspot.com/">Bargain Bites</a> and <a href="http://sweetebakes.blogspot.com/">swEEts</a>, that may entice some of you. These sites are run by lovely ladies that are friends of mine who are also married to or dating some of my good friends.</p>
<p>Bargain Bites is pretty cool because it is focused on cooking all different kinds of foods while on a budget, and Aimee, who runs the site, has created all of the recipes on her own. She was just telling me the other day about her Triple Threat Cookies that look pretty awesome.</p>

<p>swEEts is run by Evan, another third of the top three funniest girls I know, and is full of, well, sweets — cookies, cupcakes, cakes, buttercreams/icings, breads, breakfast foods, and other desserts. Some of you might be amused by these Guinness and Bailey’s Swirl Brownies:</p>
<p><a href="/2010/08/guinness.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="2660" data-permalink="/blog/2010/08/lets-talk-about-food/guinness/" data-orig-file="/2010/08/guinness.jpg" data-orig-size="288,384" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;DSC-W55&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1269022427&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="guinness" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2010/08/guinness.jpg" data-large-file="/2010/08/guinness.jpg" src="/2010/08/guinness.jpg" alt="" title="guinness" width="288" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2660" /></a></p>
<p>I can personally vouch for the cooking and baking prowess for both of these gals (especially Evan’s cookies, oh man), so you can just slobber at the recipes or give it a try. Both would be more than happy to help you out if you wanted to e-mail them.</p>
<p>We’ve also had quite a few posts on 70’s Big about food, and I’ll recap some of them here.</p>
<p>Chicken Fried Steak by Gant — <a href="/?p=405">First</a> and <a href="/?p=1025">second</a> posts</p>
<p>Gant is also the king of barbecue — <a href="/?p=636">Brisket</a> and <a href="/?p=2447">lots of meat</a> (totally no homo, Gant doesn’t play like that)</p>
<p>Jacob shares his <a href="/?p=1052">chili recipe</a></p>
<p><a href="/?p=238">Eating to gain</a></p>
<p>And a <a href="/?p=2015">great post</a> by Gant on general eating habits that is applicable to lifters and people trying to eat healthy.</p>
<p>That should have made you hungry, so let’s talk about food in the comments. You can talk about your favorite food or what you’ve eaten recently. In the last few weeks I’ve had three of my favorite meals that my mom makes; pork loin, buffalo wings, and chicken and dumplings. It is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgFLPzOMMt0">the bayst</a>.</p>
