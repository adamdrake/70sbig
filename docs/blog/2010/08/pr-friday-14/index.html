  <p>Justin’s still on his trip, and I’ve watched the sunrise from my office desk twice this week, so sorry for the lack of posts. That needn’t stop you from posting your record exploits this week. Lifting, eating, or pillaging. Let’s have it.</p>
<p>Hopefully a lot of you are going to participate in the Super Total Challenge. I’m doing mine this weekend. Choose your attempts wisely…maybe two per lift. I suspect that my deadlift will take at least a 60 pound hit by the time I get there.</p>
<p>Since we’ve already phoned it in the rest of the week, I’ll leave you with someone else’s work. These are a random selection of articles from sites you may not read that contain some good info AKA five bookmarks I can post about in five minutes before getting back to work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chaosandpain.com/content/vegetarianism-and-veganism-are-logical-poopie-flavored-lollipop">Vegetarianism and Veganism Are As Logical As a Poopie-Flavored Lollipop</a></p>
<p>This is an article about vegetarians from ChAoS &amp; PAIN. He’s a smart guy that writes a good training blog. He reminds me of myself when I was younger (goes hard, doesn’t care for rest, pushes it to the max every damn time), but he’s a hell of a lot more outspoken.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chaosandpain.com/content/just-because-you-have-vagina%E2%80%A6">Just Because You Have a Vagina…</a></p>
<p>This one is for the ladies or the post-op trannies among us. C&amp;P drops some good knowledge about how women should train.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/rebuild_yourself_with_complexes&amp;cr=">Rebuild Yourself with Complexes</a></p>
<p>This is from Dan John, the man who corrected my KB swing before I even got my first one to chest height. It’s hard to pick out one article from the DJ universe, but I chose this one because it made a significant impact on my training. This spring, I ditched a lot of my old training stuff to get in shape for spring judo. I replaced all of my conditioning (other than mat work) with barbell complexes and prowler work. I got more muscular (from the time under tension), leaner (duh), and in better condition than I have been in a long time. I won the three big spring tourneys in the masters expert division, my best result in years. This article helped me towards that goal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irongarmx.net/Articles/7_minute_rotator_cuff_solution.pdf">7 minute rotator cuff solution</a></p>
<p>A concise prehab and rehab routine for the cuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.defrancostraining.com/ask_joe/archives/ask_joe_08-10-03.html">DeFranco’s Agile 8</a></p>
<p>The solution to hip mobility problems.</p>
<p>Of course it wouldn’t be a 70sBig post if we didn’t embed a video. Here’s a typical bowl of meat for me at Genghis Grill. It’s not a PR, but it’s a good portion. If your bowl doesn’t look like this, you need to rethink your strategy.</p>
