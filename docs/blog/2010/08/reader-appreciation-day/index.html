  <p>One of 70’s Big’s campaigns is to get people competing in something. There are a lot of mental and introspective benefits to competing and it focuses training and makes it fun. Whether you are a grizzled veteran or just starting out, you can send in videos and I’ll actually start posting them regularly. I’ll try to dip into my e-mail archives for those of you who have already sent in videos.</p>
<p>For all you spectators, maybe you can use this as motivation. I haven’t heard of anyone having a bad time at their first meet/competition. And for all of you daily commentors, go ahead and strike up a conversation. I leave it up to you resourceful goons to incite a <del datetime="2010-08-24T04:31:44+00:00">riot</del> conversation topic.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you find things around the internet that are relevant to 70’s Big, whether they are videos, pictures or articles, then feel free to send those on in.</p>

<p>Stephen Winburn is a powerlifter competing in the 220 lb. class (presumably raw?) in Georgia. He has competed against AC before, and this is a video of him pulling 555 for a triple for a 37 lb. PR. Nice.</p>

<p>Duane competed in the 110kg class at the Brute Strength Stars and Stripes USAPL competition in Norfolk, VA. His total of 587.5 kg was good enough to win the weight class by a margin of 2.5kg (the same increase he made on his third attempt squat). Nice job, Duane.</p>

<p>And lastly, NolanPower from the comments did awesome at NJ states. He went 8/9, 1636 lbs. in the 220 lb. class — RAW. He caps the meet off with a 716 lb. third attempt deadlift. Fucking awesome.</p>
