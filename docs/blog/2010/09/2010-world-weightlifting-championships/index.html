  <p>The 2010 World Weightlifting Championships were over the last couple weeks in Antalya, Turkey. Unfortunately coverage is dismal for us Americans and the only videos we have are what we can scrounge on the internet. I’ll recap how the American lifters did and then highlight some other lifters.</p>
<p>You can find IWF results <a href="http://www.iwf.net/results/results_results.php?placecod=116">here</a>, and you can see all of the medal winners <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_World_Weightlifting_Championships">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re new to weightlifting, the number before their name is their weight class. Then their results are snatch/clean and jerk/total. You’ll also notice (hopefully?) that it’s in kilograms.</p>
<p>48kg Kelly Rexroad placed 17th with 74/84/155</p>
<p>58kg Amanda Sandoval placed 15th with 86/109/195</p>
<p>63kg Natalie Burgener placed 12th with 96/114/210</p>
<p>69 kg Layfield Danica Rue placed 19th with 90/115/205</p>
<p>75kg Erin Wallace placed 18th with 98/117/215</p>
<p>75kg Rachel Crass (who periodically posts on this site) placed 27th with 83/106/189</p>
<p>+75kg Sarah Robles placed 10th with 111/140/251</p>
<p>62kg Alex Lee placed 20th with 115/145/260</p>
<p>77kg Chad Vaughn placed 20th with 144/175/319 (I’ve met Chad a few times, he’s a good guy)</p>
<p>85kg Matt Bruce placed 25th with 150/180/330</p>
<p>85kg Kendrick Farris missed his three snatches and didn’t total. He’ll come back from it — we’re still rooting for you, Kendrick.</p>
<p>105kg Casey Burgener placed 25th with 162/189/351</p>
<p>105kg Donny Shankle (who is supposed to be crazy?) placed 31st with 155/189/344</p>
<p>+105kg Pat Judge placed 13th with 173/223/396</p>
<p>+105kg Collin Ito placed 25th with 146/200/346</p>
<p><strong>Other Notable Lifters</strong></p>
<p>My favorite lifter <a href="http://users.telenet.be/tom.goegebuer/images/Santa%20Domingo06/SD%20Beach1.jpg">Dmitriy Klokov</a> is always after the elusive gold medal. I couldn’t find what actually happened, but Klokov was in a heated battle with Marcin Dolega for the gold medal. I don’t know who attempted the 227 clean and jerk first, but Klokov missed it for his final C&amp;J attempt (it was his only miss that day). In the video, he looks pretty pissed about some potential plate wobbling that caused him to lose it (it’s hard to see, but there doesn’t seem to be anything noticeable). Dolega hit the 227 either before or after Klokov to win the gold medal on bodyweight (they tied in the total). Klokov came away with the gold in the snatch, but the silver in the C&amp;J and total. Dolega won the overall gold, gold in the C&amp;J, and bronze in the snatch. I hope we eventually get some video on this battle, but here’s Klokov’s footage (it’s distorted vertically):</p>

<p>Here is a video from the crowd of <a href="http://www.owresource.com/multimedia/images/chigishev/chigishev03wc3.jpg">Chigishev</a> snatching 210 for gold. It looks pretty damn hard, yet it’s still 1kg shy of his PR from 2005. Chigishev bombed out of the C&amp;J and therefore didn’t total. Bummer.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2w-hoNTAQlM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Those were just some quick highlights. If you’d like to add to the discussion by linking some of your favorite performances from the world championships, post them in the comments.</p>
