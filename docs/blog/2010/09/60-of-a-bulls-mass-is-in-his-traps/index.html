  <p>Hey guys, Shrugthug here.</p>
<p>Let me go off the record in saying this –</p>
<p>I don’t actually think my traps are that big. Well, they aren’t big ENOUGH. I admit they are disproportionate to the rest of my body, sure, and they are probably one of the only remotely visible pieces of evidence of the fact that I lift weights. The bottom line is I weigh 175lbs and this just isn’t a significant amount of mass in general.</p>
<p>But as you all know, I am aggressively working to rectify this.</p>
<p>Justin and I have had several discussions about the need for me to develop more muscular bodyweight, particularly in my upper body, but basically, it’s generally been agreed that I need to fill out 85kg with some quality weight, and eventually 94kg if I’m planning on doing anything cool.</p>
<p>There have been disagreements between us about how I should go about adding that mass though (paraphrased):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent: so i want to get more yoked, man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin: Oh yeah? What are you planning on doing?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent: probably some shrugs, Bill Starr style. i want bigger traps</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin: (sigh) Your traps are big enough. You have the traps of a 215lbs guy on a 175lbs body. Maybe you should hit some other areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent: what do you mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin: I don’t know, maybe the rest of your upper body OTHER than your traps?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve had some other disputes regarding this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent: look, all i’m saying is, i don’t see why there’s a problem with me wanting to be yoked like a bull</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin: There isn’t, but a big yoke requires the body of a bull, not a calf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, here is my response to THAT:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dj-c8fMsKY0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Shrugging for 17 reps isn’t really standard ops for me. It was kind of a special day since I was training at the WFAC with Mike, and I wanted to get a PR set of 10 in. I typically have been doing these shrugs for a top set of 5 once a week, but I wanted to have some fun. I wasn’t counting reps; I think I was more concerned with telling myself I WANNA BEAT ‘EM. BEAT EM. BEAT EM. BEAT EM! with each rep. I figured at some point that I’d done about 10, and so I did two more “just to be sure.”</p>
<p>I asked Mike if I got 10. He said, “Seventeen. Close though.”</p>
<p>As my friend Chris says, <em>I was feeling reckless</em>.</p>
