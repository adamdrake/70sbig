  <p>It’s PR Friday! Post PRs in weight lifted, emos beaten, ice cream eaten, doves shot, and Yankees headbutted.</p>
<p>August Challenge Results have been compiled. This month’s challenge was my personal favorite because it had a lot of pitfalls. I warned against them several times, yet I fell into every one of them. I might post about my mishaps at some point. Thanks to all who sacked up to do this.</p>
<p>WP Strength kicked everyone’s asses in both bodyweight and totals. They took the first six spots in the men’s division and seven of the top ten (where were you bastards in the press/pullup contest?). Josh B and Ike H both lifted a literal ton of weight. In the women’s division, Angela K, Angela D, and Jenny L all topped a grand. Solid lifting, folks.</p>
<p><strong>Women absolute</strong></p>
<p><strong>Women by weight class</strong></p>
<p><strong>Men absolute</strong></p>
<p><strong>Men by weight class</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gym division</strong></p>
<p>This month is the Tactical Strength Challenge. We’ve done it before, and I’ll put it up in a sticky later. Unless you are a professional athlete, a sponsored athlete, or someone with an event looming, there is no reason to skip out on a challenge, regardless of how silly they are.</p>
<p>PS Keep voting for the face contest.</p>
<p>PPS Don’t sit there and stare at dudes. Just glance, vote, and go eat.</p>
<p>PPPS Yes, I know the formatting is wide. I wanted to get as much meaningful data in as possible.</p>
