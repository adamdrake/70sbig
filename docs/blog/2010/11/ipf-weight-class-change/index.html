  <p>The Internationa Powerlifting Federation (IPF) has re-structured their weight classes.</p>
<p><strong>The old weight classes:</strong></p>
<p>Men (kg)</p>
<p>56/60/67.5/75/82.5/90/100/110/125/125+</p>
<p>Women (kg)</p>
<p>48/52/56/60/67.5/75/82.5/90/90+</p>
<p><strong>New Weight Classes</strong></p>
<p>Men</p>
<p>58/66/74/83/93/105/120/120+</p>
<p>Women</p>
<p>47/52/57/63/72/84/84+</p>
<p>I don’t know what to make of it. In both cases the cap for heavyweights was lowered and the minimum changed (men’s increased, women’s decreased). I know that Chris won’t be slimming down to the 265 lbs weight class, so it looks like he’ll be a super heavyweight. There’s speculation of why the weight classes were changed, but I’m not familiar with the variables that went into the official decision (I’m sure there are a lot of pissed off dudes). Feel free to share any info you find.</p>
<p>Additionally, I always look at the USAPL as the standard in powerlifting. I’ve had issues with their judging (and other people have echoed the same), but it’s one federation that is prominent throughout the country. I’m not a fan of having eight thousand different federations (Hitler is most definitely NOT a fan either, see video below). It seems that the changing weight classes will just stir the pot around a bit more and promote disparity between feds. Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Beard of the Day</strong> goes to Brian Daboll, Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator, who called a HELL of a game against the New England Patriots last Sunday. He sported a decent beard (and a shaved head, so he looks extra creepy) in the big victory in which running back Peyton Hillis rushed had over 200 yards of offense (184 yards of bruising, biceps-led rushing), and Colt McCoy pulled his weight in completing 74% of his passes, making key third down throws, and scoring a rushing touchdown. More importantly, this fired Daboll the. fuck. up. He basically attacked McCoy after his rushing touchdown and almost knocked him over. Finally…something to be glad about as a Browns fan.</p>
