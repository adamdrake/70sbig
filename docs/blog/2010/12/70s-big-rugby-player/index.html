G’day Justin,
Seeing as though you’ve had rugby players on the blog twice now, I figured I might add another suggestion.
The subject of the post today is Jonah Lomu. He played for the All-Blacks from 1994 to 2002 and in that time managed to change the face of Rugby Union.">

  <p>Tom is a belligerent Australian bloke and he sent me an e-mail with info on Jonah Lomu a while ago. This is his story.</p>

<p>G’day Justin,</p>
<p>Seeing as though you’ve had rugby players on the blog twice now, I figured I might add another suggestion.</p>
<p>The subject of the post today is <strong>Jonah Lomu</strong>. He played for the All-Blacks from 1994 to 2002 and in that time managed to change the face of Rugby Union. He came to prominence in the 1995 World Cup where over five matches he managed to score seven tries, including 4 against England. He became the sports first superstar and in the time that he played was the most fearsome player on the field. He generally played as a Winger (a position reserved for the fastest, most agile players) and did this at 6’5 and 275lbs. This is the equivalent of a linebacker playing as a running back. He scored more tries in the World Cup than any other player and did I mention he did all this after being diagnosed with Nephrotic Syndrome in 1995? (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome)</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a few clips you might enjoy. Some are big hits, some are incredible runs/footwork and then there’s a few Maori Sidesteps (which involves pretty much running straight over a bloke haha).</p>
<p>Jonah could stop players:</p>
<p>But players couldn’t stop Jonah:</p>
<p>A particularly big tackle, Jonah looks like he’s pouncing on prey in this clip.</p>
<p>I see Jonah as being 70s big for a number of reasons. Firstly, the bloke was 6’5 and 275lbs… This is not little. He carried this bulk and strength while remaining fast and conditioned as hell. He dominated in his chosen sport and endured through a debilitating illness. Big, strong, bad, and tough. 70’s Big.</p>
