<h2 id="708217s-big-euro-tour">70’s Big Euro Tour</h2>
<p>My Irish pal John Benton and I are creating a diabolical plot that would bring the new and updated 70’s Big Strength and Conditioning Workshops to Europe. John has sent some feelers (I guess feeling is an Irish thing) and the following cities are potential hosts: 2 venues in Dublin, 2-3 venues in the U.K (Manchester,London, and possibly Cardiff Wales and Newcastle), Copenhagen, and Basel, Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending or hosting, then let us know in the comments, on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/70s-Big/377258928677">Facebook fan page</a>, or <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">e-mail me</a>. The more venues or attendees there, the more likely the trip can happen.</p>
<h2 id="chat-room-vote">Chat Room Vote</h2>
<p>We are going to start a weekly chat room meeting. During this time readers can ask questions to me or anybody else (AC, Chris, Mike, Brent, and others assuming they are present) about pretty much anything.</p>
