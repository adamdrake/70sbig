  <p>_StillGrowing is a Canadian lifter named Mark. Last weekend he competed in his second powerlifting meet and sent me a write up of his experience. There are some pretty funny parts to his story, so I edited him a bit and posted the story in its entirety. Enjoy.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>I’m 18 and have been lifting (properly) for just over a year now. I started on the Starting Strength program and switched pre-maturely to Texas Method before my first meet back in June. After my first meet back in June I went back to SS, and worked up to 345x3x5 Squat, 215x3x5 Bench, and 405×5 Deadlift, at 180 bodyweight. By that time I was stalling out pretty hard, and went back to TM which I have been on since then. My second meet was December 11th with the Canadian Powerlifting Federation.</p>
<p>After weigh-in we (my parents and I) had a few hours to kill, so we went out for a quick lunch. I foolishly had a pulled pork sandwich – something we’ll get back to that later. I was lifting in the second flight, so I was warming up as the first flight was lifting. All was going well until we got up to 3 plates and someone put the pins up. I went for my last warm up, a single at 315, just like I always do, but the pins were too high and I bounced the bar off them causing me to miss it. This threw me off a little, but I got my composure back.</p>
<p>I stepped up to that platform with a 370 opener, crushed it, but my belt was feeling a lot tighter than usual. I have a lever belt and I know for sure it wasn’t in the wrong hole. My second attempt was an easy 400 because I wanted to leave some in the tank for my last attempt. I crushed it, but the belt still felt too tight. I went up for my third attempt of 430 – I had done it in training twice – so I was confident I’d hit it no problem. Unracked it, waited for the command, sunk down, and barfed; the pulled pork came back to bite me in the ass. I managed to keep about 99% of it in my mouth, but a bit came out on to the mono-lift. This wouldn’t have bugged me very much, but it caused me to miss my squat. I swallowed what was in my mouth (which was gross), apologized to the judges, and went to clean myself up and swear.</p>
<p>Now I was pissed; I hated missing that squat. It’s still bugging me now and it will until I make that much or higher at a meet. After I was cleaned up I went to look at the current results. I was in the Under 19 class even though I signed up for the open class. I decided I’d still try to beat all the other 82.5ers regardless. I was ahead of most of them with the 400 squat, but one guy had 420. This made me angry, but it was bench time, so I had to focus.</p>
<p>Warm-ups went as usual, no problem. Opened with 250, crushed it, and called for 260. About 5 lifts out from mine, we were notified that the hand off guy was busy so we had to find our own. I went and grabbed my dad to do it for me, explaining in detail what he had to do. I get up there, he helps me unrack it and position it, I’m ready to press…wait something isn’t right…”LET GO OF THE BAR DAD!” He let go and I nailed it. Call for 265. I looked at the projector screen and the same guy with the 420 squat; let’s arbitrarily call him Joe, called for 275. Now you never want someone to miss, but I wouldn’t mind it happening. As I went up for 265, I was pretty nervous as I’ve always been pretty shit at bench, but I got it pretty easily. Joe was right after me, and he was goddamn close to getting that 275, but he missed about 2/3 the way up, leaving him with 260, and me only 15lb behind.</p>
<p>While the third flight was benching I chatted with Joe for a bit, He was 23, had been training for about 6 months more than me, and I had no clue if he was clean or using. We talked about deadlifts; he was opening with 410, and hoping to get 480, I was opening with 440, my second was 495, and third would be an iffy 500; being good natured I told him all of this. As I walked away I did some quick mental math, and that would leave us both with 1160 totals, and he was a couple pounds heavier than I was. That would give me the “win” even though I wasn’t in his age class (I’m competitive, so sue me).</p>
<p>Stepped up for my first Deadlift; I smoked it, but Joe smoked his 410. I called for 495 while Joe called for 475. Joe made his lift as I was pacing the warm-up room with DMX blasting from my iPod. I chalked up and stepped to the bar. I pulled it off the floor and it started to slow down after it got above my knee, but I locked that S.O.B. out. Then I called for 500. Now, I don’t know whether Joe was as competitive as I am, or if he was just feeling reckless, but he called for 490. As I watched his attempt, he couldn’t get it off the floor, but I applaud him for trying. I was next; I have failed 500 7 times in my training, but already had 495 in the books, so I was going for it. I started the lift and it felt about the same as the 495. I thought I was going to make it, but as I got above my knee, it halted, completely; I pulled like hell, but to no avail.</p>

<p>In between my lifting I had a chance to watch the third flight lift; it was inspiring to say the least. One guy had a 615 squat, 500 bench, and a 750 deadlift and a few others weren’t that far behind. It’s damn impressive what the human body is capable of when pushed, and this is a great example of it.</p>
<p>I ended up with my 1160 total to Joe’s 1155, and there were 3 others in the 82.5 class that were between 1050-1100 totals. All in all, most would call that a good day, but I’m not most people. I’ll be back in the gym on Friday, pissed off, going for my 430 squat.</p>
<p>For anyone who’s thinking about competing, you should go for it. Even if you total a couple hundred pounds under the top of your weight class, you’ll have a fun day, meet some really awesome people, and you’ll be motivated to train harder to get your total up. For ~$75, that’s a Bargain.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Justin for giving me a hand picking my attempts.</p>
<p><em>Note: I helped him choosing some of his opening attempts in the <a href="http://widget.mibbit.com/?settings=d979218505a306cbee7d9302470fe159&amp;server=irc.synirc.net&amp;channel=%2370sbig">70’s Big Chat Room</a>. We are going to have a chat on Tuesday evening, and then have a weekly chat on Sunday evening (since that’s what you guys voted for).</em></p>
