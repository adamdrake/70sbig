<p>I get to meet a lot of people through this site, and one of them is The Scott (I don’t know how this name came to be). The Scott has e-mailed with AC and I over the past year, and he has had some great improvement in his strength. The Scott trains at Ian Carver’s <a href="http://www.crossfitcenturion.com/">CrossFit Centurion</a> where we did a workshop in August. Scott is a stocky dude at 5’9″ and weighed 216 for this meet. If I remember correctly, he was informed of it just a couple weeks ago (meaning he didn’t have a significant taper).</p>
<p>I helped him out with choosing his attempts before the meet (actually it was when we did the 70’s Big Chat Room last week) and gave him some general advice. Well, The Scott went 8/9 and PR’d on squat and deadlift.</p>
<p>Squat 456.5lbs PR</p>
<p>Bench 325lbs</p>
<p>Deadlift 501.5lbs PR</p>
<p>Total 1283lbs</p>
<p>In his last e-mail he told me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In just over a year since following 70’s Big, my squat went from 320 to 456.5 (+ 136.5lbs), bench 315 to 365 (+ 50lbs), and deadlift 370 to 501.5 (+ 131.5lbs). Thanks again for all your help and correspondence. I’m looking forward to 2011.</p>

<p>You may remember reader Matt Nolan’s (NolanPower) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdYUSH16sk8">325kg (716 lb) deadlift</a> in the 100kg/220lb weight class at the New Jersey State powerlfting comp last year. Well, he’s still training hard and sent me this PR squat vid:</p>
<p>Nice fucking work, Matt.</p>
