  <p><em>My post about Lewis (who benched 445 and squatted 650 this past week) inspired AC to do a write up about his friend and training partner Dustin. The following was written by AC.</em></p>
<p>My friend Taylor Ray got me a job at one of the local bars named RumRunners early Summer last year. I was walking around introducing myself and someone brought to my attention that I hadn’t met Dustin yet. I looked to the other side of the bar and all I saw was a back as wide as a door frame. He turned around and I introduced myself to him and in a deep southern voice Dustin replied “Niiice ta meet ya A.C.” His bear paw engulfed my hand as we introduced ourselves. Standing at 6’1 weighing around 260 pounds Dustin is certainly an intimidating southern gentleman.</p>

    Dustin knew I competed in powerlifting and he began to show some interest. Before our Christmas Break (early December until mid January) Dustin asked if he could start squatting and lifting heavy with me. He came from a Baseball background and had some collegiate playing time so I knew he would have some athletic prowess. Dustin warmed up and quickly learned and hit his first squat set across with 245. Every following set only looked better and easier. Keep in mind that he as not squatted in over 5 years.

      <em>Editor&#8217;s Note: When you teach new people to squat on a regular basis, especially when they haven&#8217;t squatted in a few years, they rarely get up above 185 or even 225 on the first day. It&#8217;s not that they can&#8217;t; it&#8217;s because form is important with the low bar back squat and a coach should hold the lifter back to reinforce the technique (along with other reasons, but I digress). </em>

      High-Fiving Dustin can be scary
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  We train together at 180 Fitness down here at Georgia Southern University. He is currently squatting 375 for his sets across and pressing 180 for three sets of five WITH EASE. Although he is not on a strict program such as novice or TM he is certainly making progress fast. He shows great potential and he lifts with passion and desire. I can proudly say that I train WITH Dustin. He is a great friend and one strong SONOFABITCH. Oh, and Dustin claims he can do a back-flip from a standing position. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it , but I will get a video of it soon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Here is a video of him squatting 375 (shitty cell phone quality).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/tGHPd_RwUqg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s note: That set is very fucking easy. It&amp;#8217;s not overly impressive internet material, but the dude is gonna be very strong very soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
