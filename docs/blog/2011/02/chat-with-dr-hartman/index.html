  <p>The 70’s Big Chat is scheduled for this evening at 5:00 PM EST, and we’ll be joined by Dr. Michael Hartman again. Usually the chat is a free-for-all that is an open forum to questions. Dr. Hartman would take some questions regarding weightlifting and beer, and I’d answer things the best I could.</p>

<p>Today’s chat will be a little different. Today is a live Q&amp;A about Dr. Hartman’s new e-book “The Next 8 Weeks…” that I featured yesterday. Dr. Hartman will be taking questions regarding this book, but I encourage any of you current or future weightlifters to join as well. We’ll also have a topic discussion on <strong>Weightlifting Strength vs General Strength</strong>. Come with questions or just to spectate, but it’ll be an informative session.</p>
