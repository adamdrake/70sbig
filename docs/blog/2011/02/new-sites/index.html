A lot of you have asked for training logs of those that are involved in this website. My tech-savvy friend Adam (who helps out with the site — thanks again, Adam) helped set up some sub-sites.

As far as their programming goes, they are all younger intermediate lifters who compete in raw powerlifting.">

  <p><strong>New Sites</strong></p>
<p>A lot of you have asked for training logs of those that are involved in this website. My tech-savvy friend Adam (who helps out with the site — thanks again, Adam) helped set up some sub-sites. AC, Chris, and Mike now have their own sub-site to be used as a training log, but will also be used for whatever they want to post about. As far as their programming goes, they are all younger intermediate lifters who compete in raw powerlifting. I took all three of them to USAPL Raw Nationals last year.</p>

<p>I nagged Ben Claridad to make a site that would allow him to show his art work, and he turned into an amusing training log that also hosts his art work. <a href="http://alongthelinesof.com/">Here is Ben’s site</a>.</p>
<p>These sites are updated a few times a week, so be sure to check them out.</p>
<p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Post all of your PR’s and training updates to the comments. Regardless of your strength level you are a part of this brotherhood of lifters on the quest to 70’s Big, so don’t be shy.</p>
<p>Oh, and fuck the Steelers.</p>
