Shrug Thug Brent does Brent-like things online. Here’s a story he told AC. I cleaned up the punctuation (The Shrug Thug refuses to use punctuation).
 So, I’m benching at the globo gym and this fucking Asian American fuck face with his cap turned sideways on his fucking head, repping 135 is like, “say bro, you go to UTD?">

<p>Brent does Brent-like things online. Here’s a story he told AC. I cleaned up the punctuation (The Shrug Thug refuses to use punctuation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I’m benching at the globo gym and this fucking Asian American fuck face with his cap turned sideways on his fucking head, repping 135 is like, “say bro, you go to UTD?” (UTD is a school around here)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am like, “Nah man, I didn’t go to school here.”</p>
<p>And he is like “Oh cool, what are you working out for? Getting cut, getting bigger, Strength?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He proceeds to spend the rest of the workout making friends with me. He says he benched 280lbs at 155lbs and says he used to do 35 pull-ups before he stopped working out. There is a bullshit “leader board” at this globo gym ranking top 5 faggots at squat, bench, leg press, max pull ups, and max push ups. JH is like “I am gonna be on that list for pull ups” as if it’s some big fucking accomplishment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am like “Cool man, spot?” because I am benching and need a spot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He is fucking all pumped about pull ups, he climbed all the way to the top of this big support beam in the middle of the gym (like a 50′ ceiling at least) and he is like, “Let’s do some pull ups. I am all about form man, that shit is the most important. I will show you some legit form on pull ups.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So he asks me to show him how I do pull ups, and I do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He says “Good form bro, let me show you how I do them,” and proceeds to not go to full extension.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He wants to “start a team” and have everyone train together. You remember that scene in Inglorious Basterds where they are in the bar and the SS officer is joking with Stiegler, and Stiegler very clearly wants to stab the guy in the face? That was me except instead of stabbing i would have just said, “Your civic fucking sucks and that spoiler you have on it is absolutely ridiculous.”</p>

<h2 id="no-no-no-squat-at-600-pounds">No, No, No Squat at 600 pounds</h2>
<p>Glenn Pendlay coaches some good Olympic weightlifters. Unfortunately Max has a wrist injury that prevents him from lifting. He’s still squatting though:</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="368" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EuCWFqMrodE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Someone that is friends with Max sent me the vid after I had seen it, but they told me the following story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True story: He had serious injury and not worked out for months, no squats no nothing. One morning he was training someone and was standing there in some running shoes, holding a coffee, while looking at his iPhone. Someone had left a squat bar set up with 200 kilos, and Max said “I bet I can squat this cold.” I assessed the situation as easy money for me, and a safe bet I would either call his bluff or he would fail. I offer up $20. He put down his coffee and iphone, walked to the bar a took my money. Not only did he not warm up in any way, he had not touched a weight in 6 months. Fast forward, and Max is back to training, the result a 601 lbs A2A squat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moral: Max is mutant strong, do not bet against him. Ever.</p>
</blockquote>
