My friend Spencer is an editor at the sports site Every Day Should Be Saturday and a contributor to SB Nation. He’s been to one of the 70’s Big Workshops, has written this article about AC, has a gnarly mustache, and refers to himself as “more of a pack mule” regarding conditioning. In other words, he’s a cool dude.
A couple weeks ago he asked me some questions that came from his readers for the first episode of his off-topic podcast, Squatland Yard.">

  <p><strong>Squatland Yard</strong></p>
<p>My friend Spencer is an editor at the sports site <a href="http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/">Every Day Should Be Saturday</a> and a contributor to <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/">SB Nation</a>. He’s been to one of the 70’s Big Workshops, has written <strong><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2010/3/31/1396177/mustache-weekend-part-two-powerlifting">this article</a></strong> about AC, has a gnarly mustache, and refers to himself as “more of a pack mule” regarding conditioning. In other words, he’s a cool dude.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago he asked me some questions that came from his readers for the first episode of his off-topic podcast, <strong><a href="http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/2011/2/10/1986834/completely-off-topic-squatland-yard-wants-you-recruit">Squatland Yard</a></strong>. What resulted is a random, amusing podcast. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Reckless</strong></p>
<p><a href="/chris">Chris</a> and <a href="/mike">Mike</a> train hard and are reckless. They are both on advanced stages of some kind of TM programming that we’ve tweaked together. Here are a few solid vids.</p>
<p>Here’s Chris squatting 610×2 — more than his old max.</p>

<p>Here is Mike pulling a solid 545×3. He pulled around 580 last summer, and I expect him to break the 600 mark at Militar Nationals in San Antonio. <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="368" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yPMsxvhqmrU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, Mike’s brother is a jacked, deep voiced dude who is getting back into training. He smokes an easy 475×3 squat here:</p>

<p>Boom.</p>
