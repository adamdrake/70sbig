  <p>As detailed <a href="http://doctorhartman.blogspot.com/2011/02/next-8-weeks.html">here</a>, Dr. Hartman released a free competition prep program for Olympic weightlifting. With over 500 downloads, most of the users were asking what they should do after the competition taper. After putting some work in, Dr. Hartman came to the conclusion that most lifters need or want one of three things: strength, technique, or a mixture of the two.</p>
<p>Strength is important for weightlifting; after all, you’re putting weight over your head. However, strength in the absence of quality mechanics won’t mean dick on the weightlifting platform. Dr. Hartman’s e-book, “<a href="http://uploadnsell.com/buy/Da0JGT">The Next 8 Weeks…</a>” is comprised of programs to increase weightlifting strength (Note: this is different than powerlifting or general strength), technique on the lifts, and an efficient hybrid of the two. Combined with the competition prep program (<a href="http://doctorhartman.blogspot.com/p/free-training-course.html">available for free</a>), these programs can plan out at LEAST 8 months of training.</p>
<p>When I read through the programs in the e-book, it made me want to grab a bar and start lifting again (alas, logistically I currently can’t). These programs are designed for someone who is an experienced weightlifter. They would need to have competed in at least a few competitions. I won’t speak for Dr. Hartman, but it would take someone at least six months to get the point of using the programs from “<a href="http://uploadnsell.com/buy/Da0JGT">The Next 8 Weeks…</a>“. The reason is Dr. Hartman uses a very precise variable manipulation to shift volume, intensity, and technique appropriately for quality performance peaks. Personally, I’d feel good knowing that my training was on a long-term plan to create those peaks; too often Olympic weightlifters who train by themselves are in various stages of overreaching beyond their capability without having the discipline to allow a peak.</p>
<p>To prepare yourself for Hartman’s programs, I suggest learning the lifts and getting on an weightlifting focused program. Depending on your strength level, you may need a program that continues to establish a strength base as you do the lifts. I created a <a href="/blog/2009/12/merry-christmas/">novice weightlifting program</a> that would allow a trainee to get some experience with the Olympic lifts while improving their strength. I think it’s a good program to run for four to six weeks to get the joints and structures ready for more weightlifting frequency. After this base with the lifts is established, a trainee should compete and also shift their training to an intelligent three day-a-week program (perhaps it would consist of snatch and C&amp;J every day with Day 1 as medium to moderate, Day 2 as a little lighter, and Day 3 as the heavy/max day with some strength work thrown in after the two lifts). After another four to six weeks on such a program, the trainee might be eligible for Dr. Hartman’s programs, but the more experience the better. Hartman’s programs from “<a href="http://uploadnsell.com/buy/Da0JGT">The Next 8 Weeks…</a>” include a good amount of work, and you don’t want to set yourself up for failure by not being adapted to doing the lifts at least three times a week.</p>
<p>I like the programs Dr. Hartman created. Again, I would feel confident that my training was preparing me for performance peaks instead of having to structure my training by trial and error. These programs are worth a read. I consider them to be solid the way they are, but you could still pull concepts and ideas from studying them. To get some examples of the different programs, Dr. Hartman has included some information on each one in <a href="http://doctorhartman.blogspot.com/2011/02/weightlifting-program-comparison.html">THIS</a> blog post. If you have any questions, I’m sure he’d be happy to answer them in the comments of that post.</p>
