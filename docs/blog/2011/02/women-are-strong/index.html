  <p>I’m working on those “other projects”, and this post seemed extremely relevant. Courtney is 5’2″, 125 lbs, is from Reston, VA, and can deadlifted 332lbs. As they say around the interwebz, that’s “mega hawt”. Her goals for this year are to deadlift 350 and squat 275.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of her doing a 290 pound sled drag. She had 135 lbs. in bumpers on there, but it wasn’t heavy enough so her friend jumped on to make it 290. No big deal.</p>

<p>What we have here is a cute girl who deadlifts over 300 pounds, and wants to deadlift and squat more. Courtney said in her e-mail,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you will share this on your site as I work to show women just how much fun strength training can be! Hopefully I will be making those lift goals in no time :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes it’s true; stronger women are the best.</p>
<p>What have I got to say to those of you who aren’t significantly stronger than this girl? Step up your game, son.</p>
