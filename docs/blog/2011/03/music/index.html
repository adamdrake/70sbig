  <p>There have been some posts on what music readers like to listen to when lifting, but <a href="/blog/2010/03/damn-it/">this one</a> is the only one worth reading. As I’m typing this, I’m listening to Alice Cooper’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQE0pfBAYQ8">Welcome To My Nightmare</a>” — go ahead and click it if you want the full effect of reading this post (if you don’t like YouTube, go to Playlist.com and search it).</p>
<p>Music can help act as a catalyst for the release of adrenaline, but it can also have a calming effect. It’s incredibly useful to inject a mood when emotion and intensity are low. However, I do believe that music can be a crutch. It denies the necessity to learn how to get psyched up without it, and it also neglects learning how to get relaxed without it. Nevertheless, it’s very useful when training <del datetime="2011-03-15T14:05:14+00:00">and drinking</del>.</p>

<p>Personally, I’m not impressed with the majority of music. I hate most mainstream music and most types of music. I prefer obvious displays of artistic ability, and that isn’t found within pop, emo, U2, or Creed. Additionally, lifters stereotypically prefer metal that has a guy screaming with a horrible guttural noise that is sorta like, but not necessarily the noise I make when I vomit. Again, I’m unimpressed. That doesn’t mean I don’t like metal or any other type of music; you can go ahead and assume that I not only am unimpressed with your favorite bands or songs, but that I hate them.</p>
<p>Hell, who gives a shit what I think? This post isn’t about what I do or don’t like, it’s about what <em>you</em> like. Detail what your favorite type of training music is, and then what specific type of music or songs you prefer on your heavy or intense sets. To me, “training music” would be something that I would enjoy having on in the background during warm-ups or assistance exercises. That is a category that is different than what I consider “squat songs”, or songs that I listen to specifically for squatting really heavy. Post your favorites to the comments. Don’t hesitate to make fun of each other (it’s all in good fun).</p>
<p><em>(You can post YouTube links if you want, but remember that you can get better quality on other music sites like playlist.com)</em></p>
<p>I’ll go first:</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been in a gym that doesn’t have music playing at all, and I don’t use a music device. I psyche up without music, but last night I psyched up <em>thinking</em> about Led Zeppelin’s <strong>Achille’s Last Stand</strong>, which is an awesome ten minute tune with some intense guitar and drum pieces (and is one of my favorite songs overall). I’ve squatted to <strong>When the Levee Breaks</strong> by Zeppelin, <strong>I’m a Man</strong> by Chicago (the first album is solid, down hill after the early days), and most songs from Guns N’ Roses Appetite for Destruction album, namely <strong>Welcome to the Jungle</strong>, <strong>Nighttrain</strong>, and especially <strong>Out Ta Get Me</strong>. With the exception of Sweet Child O’ Mine, that whole album is solid. Most Led Zeppelin is, but I don’t enjoy their stuff that is overplayed on the radio and opt for the more bluesy stuff like <strong>Since I’ve Been Loving You</strong>, but it’s more for laid back training. Also, I really like Billy Idol for lifting heavy. I shit you not, <strong>Rebel Yell</strong> and <strong>White Wedding</strong> get me amped. Other than that, I like most upbeat classic and 80’s rock to have in the background of training. I haven’t heard much metal outside of 80’s metal, but I enjoy Metallica’s early stuff and Motorhead.</p>
