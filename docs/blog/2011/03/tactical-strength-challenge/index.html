<ol>
<li>
<p>Max deadlift. You get three attempts to find your max pull. Do it meet-style. If you make an “AC-jump” between your first and second attempt, there is no going back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max pullups. Dead hangs. No chinning (palms must face away), and absolutely no kipping. Kippers will be shot, killed, and then banned from posting here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 min Kettlebell snatch test. You may set the weight down or switch hands as necessary. If you absolutely can’t find a kettlebell, use an equivalent dumbbell and mention that in your results.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3 major divisions are as follows:</p>
<p>Men’s Elite: 10kg weighted pullups, 32kg kettlebell (70lb DB)</p>
<p>Men’s Open: BW pullups, 24kg kettlebell (55lb DB)</p>
<p>You must make a minimum of one deadlift, pullup and snatch or you score 0 in the above divisions.</p>
<p>Women’s Open: BW pullups, 16kg kettlebell (35lb DB)</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that in the heaviest division, strong adult males have a significant advantage because pullup and snatch reps will be lower, thus deadlift contributes more of the final score. Everyone is encouraged to enter the hardest division they can complete. Novice and masters divisions are also available. Full rules and scoring are <a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com/rules.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Perform the 3 events in one session, and rest at least 15 minutes between each, even more if you have time. Perform the TSC and post your results by April 17 on the results sticky which will be up by the end of March. Get your friends that lift to complete the TSC with you and post their results with yours. If you don’t have kettlebells, dumbbells or cool friends there is a <a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com/tsc_locations.asp">list of locations</a> around the world that might be hosting a TSC on April 9. If one’s near you make sure to contact them ahead of time to confirm they’re still on for spring. They’re required to be free and this is a great way to meet lifters in your area and test the waters of competition.</p>
