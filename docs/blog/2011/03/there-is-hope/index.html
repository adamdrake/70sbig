  <p>Generally speaking, I don’t hate groups of people. But I sure dislike them. For instance, it bothers me that girls and women nowadays are attracted to effeminate, poonish males. Masculinity is a dying trait in today’s world; I weep for the future. What happened to the man’s man? What happened to grizzled, yet affectionate men? What happened to flannel? Some of you may find this hard to believe, but there are actually “males” out there that are mistaken for a woman! I’ve always said, “It should be a primary goal of either sex to never be mistaken for the opposite sex.” I stand by that.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I heard two stories yesterday that gave me hope. The first referenced a female who lost interest in a guy because he “loved to sing”. When asked about it, she replied, “I just don’t want to date anyone that is less masculine than I am.” This girl ain’t a butch, either.</p>
<p>The second story is from <a href="http://crossfitmonterey.wordpress.com/">Jacob Tsypkin</a>. Jacob asked for a class of milk at a coffee shop, and his milk was served in a wine glass.</p>

<p>Then the girls at the counter were complimenting his beard (see how gnarly it is in this video). He thanked them and said, “Most girls don’t like beards.” The girl replied in deadpan fashion, “Well, you see, I like men. Not boys.”</p>
<p>There is hope, yet.</p>
<p>Do any of you have hope that women prefer masculinity and ruggedness over skinny, shorn poons?</p>
