<p>Easy answer, ass size must be greater than 38” around. Why does this matter? Having a big ass means you can move and squat heavy weight, preferably at least your body weight. You might ask, well what about having a fat ass, does that count? No. Being a 70’s Big Female is not just about having a dumptruck on your backside, but you must also be able to haul that dumptruck wherever life may need it to go. Example: chin ups, pull ups, overhead squats, etc. It is more about having a GREAT ass.</p>
<p>In Cori’s 24 years of life on this planet – nearly all of them spent in a gym (playpen positioned right next to the chalk bowl, barbell in hand) – she has seen many women who would qualify as a 70’s Big Female, but has also seen many who would not represent. These women prefer to be skinny rather than strong. SKINNY = FAIL! What they don’t understand is that training hard, squatting heavy, and lifting serious weights is sexy.</p>

    Lifting quite clearly makes you sexy (Cori as a youngster)
  </p>
</div>
<p>In addition, we have got to get other 70’s Big Females training to be to able haul their great asses off the ground from a dead hang position. This is not something that comes easily to most women, especially when you are carting around a 38” undercarriage, but with hard work, it is totally attainable. Pretty soon you’ll be cranking them out like Sarah Connor in Terminator 2, doing chin-ups in the mental hospital right before she beats the shit out of those guards. Sweaty, strong, and fucking badass.</p>
<p>Cori’s father runs a high school Olympic weightlifting program in Minnesota and recently told us he was having problems recruiting young female lifters. He asked one of the volleyball coaches why these girls did not want to train and get better at their sport. The volleyball coach stated that the leaders on the team wanted to “look smaller” rather than be a powerhouse volleyball team. Skinny instead of winning? Come on girls, it’s all about WINNING (sorry, Charlie)! We think the skinny mentality is toxic and could spread to the rest of the team. Where are our 70’s Big Female leaders? Who can tell these young girls that sexiness and winning comes from squatting BIG, not being a twig fairy. It happens by actually putting weight on the barbell and going up and down, up and down, up and down, etc. You get the point. We would like to empower women by encouraging them to strive to be “real women”. Strong women. Thirty-eight inch ass women. 70’s Big Women.</p>

    Ellee in Sarah Conner garb, pre-rip
  </p>
</div>
<p>Last Halloween, Ellee was doing a WOD (while wearing her Sarah Connor costume) where heavy overhead squats were the main attraction. Minutes into the overhead squats, she felt some intense restriction in the ass/thigh region of her pants while performing the squats, but she decided to power-through. However, her ass could not be contained, and her left butt cheek flew out of the cheap-ass material. We are talking a clean rip of about 14” centered over the left ass. Fellas, she only wears g-strings, so she had nothing to hide behind. Ellee was a bit embarrassed, but Cori guarantees that every female in the gym was thinking, “Damn! If my ass rips out of my pants – I sure hope it looks as good as hers!” Now that is a true LEADER!</p>

    Post-rip
  </p>
</div>
<p>So 70’s Big Females, here is your challenge this week:</p>
<p>1 – Measure that ass and be proud!</p>
<p>2 – Make sure you can squat at least your bodyweight in one of your training sessions this week. Better yet, try to clean and jerk your body weight.</p>
<p>3 – Try to haul that ass up by working on your dead hang chin ups. Try to get one per day at first. Nothing sexier than that scene in Terminator 2.</p>
<p>4 – We dare you to try and blow out your pants!</p>
<p>Leave comments on your success! Until next time…</p>
