  <p><em>Here is the weekly installment of 70’s Big Females by Cori and Ellee.</em></p>
<p>First, we must address the issue of how to properly measure the 70’s Big Booty. Please watch our instructional video today:</p>
<p><strong>Measuring the Ass</strong></p>
<p>*For total accuracy, it should actually take place in the nude, but for the sake of keeping it clean, we are clothed. Here at 70’s Big Female, we take ass size VERY seriously!</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="283" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RcQh2V9J6KI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>*For the record, Cori qualified at an outstanding 41 inches! ASSessment results: PASS. 70’s Big Female membership was made official with a congratulatory and obligatory ass slap (vital component).</p>
<p><strong>Grunt. Groan. Yell. Scream.</strong></p>
<p>Is it okay for women to make grunting noises while lifting? We are going reply with an emphatic YES and here is why. Have you ever pinned yourself under a clean and couldn’t get up? Grabbed on to a deadlift and tried like hell to pull yet to no avail? Have you had to aggressively finish your pull on a snatch in order to get under the weight? Did you clench your gut and let out a whelp? If you didn’t, maybe you should have. If you did, we bet it felt really fucking good. It’s not just about making beastly noises and showing that you are the alpha female. Part of the grunting is you performing the Valsalva maneuver.</p>
<p>You are basically restraining your airway during an attempted forced expiration against a closed glottis. This keeps air from escaping your lungs, and the muscles of your abdomen and rib cage contract. This creates rigid compartments of fluid in the lower torso and air in the upper torso. The advantage is increasing the rigidity of the entire torso, making it easier to support heavy weights!</p>
<p>Once you hit that sticky point, go ahead and release a tiny bit of that pressure with a hearty groan. Part of grunting, screaming, whaling, etc can be vital to making some of your heaviest lifts! In addition, you can spare yourself from those occasional, unsightly petechiae (broken capillary blood vessels) around your eyes. Better yet, you may avoid keeling over like a woman of the 16th Century whose corset is too tight. We may be ladies, but we are not delicate flowers!</p>
<p>(<em>Editor’s Note: The groan, grunt, scream, or forceful exhaling with the tongue on the teeth</em> will <em>temporarily spike intra-abdominal and thoracic pressure but will relieve a bit of the blood vessel pressure, hence the reason you should do it if you’re about to white out or pass out in the hardest part of a lift [locking out DLs, sticking point of front squat, etc.]</em>)</p>
<p>Okay so maybe you are feeling a bit self-conscious and aren’t comfortable showing off your alpha female yet. Fine, but we dare you to give it a go. When you start making crazy faces and wailing like a banshee the weight on the bar is no longer an issue. Not to mention how incredible it feels to just unleash the inner she-beast and scream during most acts of physical exertion and exhilaration. Fuck the neighbors!!! But we digress . . .</p>
<p><strong>70’s Big Female Tasks of the Week:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let it out! Show us what you got! And then tell us how it went and how amazing your lifting was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your ass has been legitimately measured. Remember, at least 38”!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love your body as much as possible and to celebrate, walk around your domicile in the nude!</p>
</li>
</ol>
