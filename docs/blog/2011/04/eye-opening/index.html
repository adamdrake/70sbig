  <p>Folks, we talk a lot about barbell training on this site, but we ignore too many other forms of training out there. For instance, look at the utility in this equipment:</p>

<p>First, they save you $125. What you are saving it on is immaterial. Instead, look at the set-up. Yes, the actor may be a bit smaller than us, but look at his attire. He looks great! And he’s so functional — the shaking he experiences on the ring push-ups means he’s building functionality that can’t be attained anywhere else.</p>
<p>As far as programs go, P90X is magnificent. If you go to 1:48 in this video and watch the progress pictures, you’ll notice how P90X magnificently removed body hair from this subject. Magnificent ;-)</p>

<p>Lastly, a lot of you have been thinking about trying out Olympic lifting. I advise you, good sirs, to obtain optimal form with PVC pipe before attempting it with a bar. If you can’t do it with PVC, how can you do it with a load?</p>

<p>I am so excited to announce that it is PR Friday! I caution you “heavy eaters” out there to not post today, let’s focus on healthy eating in this PR Friday. The only people that can post are lifters who eat less than 50 grams of carbohydrates a day and squat more than 500 pounds. Also, if you don’t do everything I say, you can’t post here either. Oh, and you have to call me High Chancellor when you do it. Or else.</p>
