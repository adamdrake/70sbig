  <p>The summer is open for doing workshops around the country and potentially the world. There are now two different kinds of workshops that 70’s Big presents:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming workshops</li>
</ol>
<p>These workshops have a focus on learning the fundamentals of programming strength, conditioning, and then a combination thereof. These workshops also include a “lift around” where attendees can get form checks, learn a new movement, or practice coaching.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Lifting workshops</li>
</ol>
<p>This type of workshop is more focused on the lifting. After a brief fundamentals lecture on equipment (especially belt use), mechanics, and prehab/rehab/mobility for lifters, the day is focused on lifting. All lifts are fair game: squat, press, bench, deadlift, snatch, and clean and jerk. The gym owner and/or attendees will dictate what lifts are included, but the stock plan is to get work on the strength lifts.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to combine these workshops for a two day weekend event. If you are interested in hosting a workshop, e-mail <a href="mailto:justin@70sbig.com">Justin@70sbig.com</a>. If you want to attend a workshop and want to campaign for 70’s Big to come to your city, shoot an e-mail (it will help if you have a place in mind or know someone who is interested in hosting). Please note that tank-tops, facial hair, aviator sunglasses, beer, and meat will be a constant presence in these workshops.</p>
<p><strong>Denver, June 8</strong></p>
<p>There will be a Lifting Workshop in Denver, CO at <a href="http://www.crossfitlodo.com/">CrossFit LoDo</a> on Saturday, June 8th, 2011. A full schedule with details will be released soon.</p>
<p><strong>Australia</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been working with my mate on getting a workshop in Sydney, Australia. We are going to tentatively plan a date in July, but need to gauge interest before spending money on travel. We will have a “registration” (with no payment) process until June. If we don’t get enough people by then, we’ll call it off. If we do, then we’ll finalize the schedule for the workshop a month later. E-mail <a href="mailto:justin@70sbig.com">Justin@70sbig.com</a> if you are an Aussie who is interested.</p>
<h2 id="videos-you-should-see">Videos You Should See</h2>
<p>Most of these vids are old, but impressive. Weightlifting doesn’t get enough attention on this site.</p>
<p>World record snatch in training, 202.5kg:</p>

<p>AC and I were laughing about this chick’s vids. Feel free to pick it apart. We aren’t just assholes, so tell me what is wrong with her teaching, the lift, and the mechanics. Then go back to being an asshole.</p>
