 I actually read about this on the highly esteemed bodybuilding.com forums, but there is apparently a niche meet held in Russia in which lifters invited to the Super Cup of Titans compete for highest total irregardless of their weight class, so you have guys like Andrey Belyaev at 220 going up against Andrey Malanichev at 275.
 The entire meet roster is full of badasses obviously.">

  <p>Hey guys, this is Honey Badger reporting.</p>
</br>
<p>I actually read about this on the highly esteemed <a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=134752531">bodybuilding.com forums</a>, but there is apparently a niche meet held in Russia in which lifters invited to the Super Cup of Titans compete for highest total <strong>irregardless</strong> of their weight class, so you have guys like Andrey Belyaev at 220 going up against Andrey Malanichev at 275.</p>
</br>
<p>The entire meet roster is full of badasses obviously. See Malanichev squatting 450kg/993lbs with a belt + knee wraps. Note that he misses it on his 2nd attempt and retakes it for a 3rd to get three white lights. lol?</p>

</br>
<p>Rules at Super Cup of Titans are the same as IPF, complete with walking the weight out of the rack and back in, stringent depth standards, and single-ply gear.</p>
</br>
<p>Before I go on, let me clarify that relative strength is irrelevant. A “double bodyweight squat” isn’t a big deal if you weigh 150lbs (or in my case, 164lbs ……….), and comparing the fact that a lighter lifter lifts “relatively” more than a heavier lifter is fucking asinine and pathetic.</p>
</br>
<p>One of the standouts in this meet, however, would be 220lbs Andrey Belyaev, who placed 3rd in this meet despite being the lightest contender. See the results <a href="http://titans2011.base4you-test.ru/">here</a>. Let me point out that the difference between Belyaev and the typical bodyweight-multiple wannabe is that Belyaev totaled fucking 1100kg/2420lbs in single ply and is also an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IZoTSkz39fM">insanely strong</a> raw lifter:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Also, Belyaev may have been the lightest contender but at like 5’8″, 220lbs isn’t necessarily “small.” He’s fucking jacked like a motherfucker.</p>
</br>
<p>When it comes down to being reality, you don’t have to put the addendum, “and I only weigh xxxlbs” to your lifts if you are actually strong. If you are like Belyaev you can say “I deadlift 380kg/836lbs raw” and that’s the end of the discussion. Everyone nods their heads and says “yeah that’s pretty legit” and nobody has to add “… for your bodyweight” to make you feel better.</p>
</br>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg6uxSQbppk&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=315">A short interview with Belyaev, his coach, and his family</a>.</p>
</br>
<p>Take away points relevant to us:</p>
</br>
<p>1.) Everybody can be strong in their own gym, <strong>but result must be shown in competition</strong>. Fuckin’ A.</p>
</br>
<p>2.) No matter what place he takes at the tournament, <strong>he will stand</strong>. Who fucking gives a shit if he will be the lightest contender at a meet. Come at him, bro. Fuck excuses. If you go to a meet, go to fucking compete.</p>
</br>
<p>3.) He won a lot of titles in 2010 after leaving the IPF, <strong>but results were too far from ideal</strong>. Going to meets isn’t about placing when there are 3 lifters total in your weight class, and it’s not about being a big fish in a little pond. No one cares about a $5 medal you got because you just showed up. It’s about achieving the best competition results you’re capable of posting. Challenge yourself. Strive to get better. This is probably the most important thing you can do as an athlete. Titles, trophies, and medals couldn’t be more irrelevant.</p>
