<meta name="description" content="Ben hit a 171kg at the NorCal Open on Sunday. His meet PR was 165. He opened at 166.


  


Ben missed 175 after. He snatched 140 in the meet (go here for his write up).
In other news, Brent is still being an asshole and snatching with iron plates. He had an overall PR of 235 pounds recently. In his words: should note that those are not bumpers, setting is a globo gym, and this is me not giving a fucking shit.


  


The last time he was snatching around that weight, he was weighing 180 or so. In this video, he’s 164. Not a big deal, really.
What happens after snatching with iron plates? Clean and jerking with iron plates, of course.


  


May as well deadlift right after, slow touch and go. Make sure and read the info on this vid. Oh, and the shirt he’s wearing is a picture of an astronaut with the caption, “Not all dreams can come true.”">

<p>Lastly, I posted this video a long time ago, but Ben recently re-posted this on his training log. <a href="/?s=ricky+bruch">Ricky Bruch</a> is so awesome.</p>
