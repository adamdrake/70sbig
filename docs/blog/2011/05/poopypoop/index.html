  <p>Observe this public service announcement from Spencer at California Strength:</p>
<p>(this was supposed to be a PR set of five)</p>

<p>I want to point out that the red and black NWO has been dead for years, but Spencer doesn’t give any shits; Wolfpack 4 Life. Secondly, Spencer was all set to squat 235kg (517 lbs. for you uncultured Americans) for a set of five. And then he went insane AND FUCKING DOUBLED IT UP. He’s the type of guy who says, “Ma’am, that’s not nearly enough pancakes.” He’s the type of guy who lays down six aces in a friendly poker game. He’s the type of guy who is still shredding the air guitar after the song is over. He doesn’t <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AvA-cEyfEw">give a shit</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not like he doesn’t care about getting better or getting stronger; he clearly cares about that. But he’s not worrying about the minutiae in the moment and when it’s go time, he fucking brings it. Trying to hit a weight, and then summoning all your energy to fucking annihilate it are two very different things. When you’re hitting a set, get reckless.</p>
<p>Did you watch the ending of that video? Spencer isn’t allowed to take dbol, so he makes his own…by being a fucking man.</p>
