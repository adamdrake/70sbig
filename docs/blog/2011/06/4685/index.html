  I don&#8217;t really have any recent lifting videos that would be worth watching, but here&#8217;s a video of me doing rows with a 150 pound dumbbell for 20 reps.<br /> <br /> <iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WEwH2SPxv6k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Usually there won’t be as many fucking videos of myself, but I’m finishing up a project today and haven’t had time for any other material. If you have a problem with that, then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH62Jd5qCj0&amp;feature=related">watch this</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally Brent and I will be in Monterey for a lifting workshop on July 9. Brent will just be there, giving you indiscriminate looks and I’ll coaching lifting technique. Then we’ll go to eat and hear Brent give us a fucking preface on his diet and training, implying that we need to take care of him like Gizmo from Gremlins.</p>

<p>Let’s get a good convo going in the comments. First I want to point out that I write and do a lot of weird stuff in posts or videos that no one ever comments on. I mainly do it just to see if anybody will say anything, but you guys apparently just accept it as normal. When my mom filmed the “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb76hFpEZ-s">helpful mobility vid</a>“, she goes, “Don’t you want to comb your hair and put on some shorts?” I didn’t hesitate to say, “Absolutely not. If anything it’s better this way.”</p>
