  <p>I’m just letting you guys know that I’m with Brent in Monterey, and we’re creating some decent material for you. You’ll probably leave it rather than take it.</p>
<p>Brent and I mobbed the fuck out ourselves before training yesterday. Then we snatched and Brent clean and jerked after. It was my fourth time snatching this year, but I hit 265 lbs and missed a 275 on the account of being tired (and a pussy). My hip is feeling top notch. Brent was kind of a pussy about snatching and missed 225 behind. His cleans were smooth, but his jerk left something to be desired for. He said he felt fucking fantastic after our intense mob session but could have performed better with more food before hand. I don’t know what the fuck he’s talking about because he had a badass burrito, then he had steak and a sweet potato prior to training (in comparison I just had the burrito). If anything, it was the travelling, but of course Brent will blame the food. Everything wrong with his training is the food instead of the “by the pants programming” or lack of fucking hydration. How can a man, specifically an Asian man, improve his mobility when he a) doesn’t eat any food up on waking up in the morning and b) is clearly not hydrating. I hate Brent Kim.</p>
