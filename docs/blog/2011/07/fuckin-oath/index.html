  <p>The past couple days have been eventful. Tom and I were able to put some rounds down range with an M4, we visited the local nature park (where I played with wallabies, pet drop bears (see vid below), and fed kangaroos…among other things), and some how got the opportunity to get savaged by trained attack K-9s. You read that right: Tom and I received attacks from trained Shepards that were aiming to take our arms clean off. Yes, there is video. Plenty of video. Here’s a preview:</p>
