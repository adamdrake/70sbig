<p>FIT started as a brief resource to address many of the common misconceptions about fitness and what it takes to program it, yet has morphed into a 300+ page book that beginning and advanced trainees alike can benefit from. <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/">Dr. Michael Hartman</a> and I were recruited to add content to what will be an incredibly informative book.</p>
<p>FIT provides the “why” and “how” of the purposeful integration of strength, endurance, and mobility training; addresses misinformation associated with fitness; and gives the readers direction to make decisions regarding their fitness. FIT fills the void in taking the theory and applying it to exercise programming.</p>

<p>The strength chapter alone would be well worth the price for a 70’s Big reader. At 50 pages it’s a hefty dose of programming at many levels including an array of templates that aren’t common in the “online training communities”.</p>
<p>The endurance chapter dissects why the traditional long, slow distance method of training isn’t effective, discusses the anatomy of endurance, provides a thorough analysis of running economy and technique, recommends efficient footwear, and discusses specific methods to prepare for endurance goals.</p>
<p>The mobility chapter provides knowledge on the physiology of stretching, motor abilities, how to improve agility and balance, and specific exercises and stretches that can help balance the body.</p>
<p>The 25,000+ word multi-element fitness chapter that I wrote funnels this information together and provides the direction for the fitness trainee. The hierarchy of emphasis in training elements is thoroughly explained and guidelines are provided to the reader. High intensity endurance training is categorized based on the level of stress it imparts on the body with very clear descriptions of each type. However, not all trainees need the toughest stress; types of trainees defined with very clear progressions on how to take someone from sedentary and very un-fit to a strong, sleek, and enduring specimen. There are lines of progression and programming templates for every type of trainee whether they aim to get strong and maintain their conditioning or get conditioned after a specialization in strength.</p>
<p>Each of these chapters are worth the book price alone, yet are all pieces of the project that has become FIT. The paper-back book will be released around August 15th on Amazon.com</p>
<p>Post any questions you have about the book to the comments.</p>
