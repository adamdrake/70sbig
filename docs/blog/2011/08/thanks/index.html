Chicago – Ellee, Cori, Doogie, Cory, and Jay
Canada – My bicepped studs Paul and Chris (with their better halves), Rowan, and Mark
Monterey – Gabe, Nate, Mariah, Bill, Elliott, Harj, and Robin
Australia – Pete (top fucking bloke), Shannon (another top bloke), Harvey (awesome dude — see the trend?), Shane (both of them), Stuart — and all of you other fuckers. You guys were all great.
And that’s just from the past few months. There’s all kinds of great people like Ruth and Sean (power couple), Marcus, and Avelyn from CF Intrepid; Lisa in Santa Monica; Ryan Huseman and the Coffman’s at CF Amarillo; Ian and Allison at CF Centurion. And of course I’ve got homeys like Jacob Cloud, Kittensmash, and Brian who I actually need to meet to prove you aren’t just mouth breathers on the computer (like Tom is). Then there’s a lot of you I interact with in the comments and in the chat room — you all are too numerous to name.

  <p>In the time that I’ve had this website, I’ve been fortunate enough to meet a lot of great people through the internet or in person. Some of you have become my good friends like Al, Tom, Hom, <a href="http://crossfitmonterey.wordpress.com/">Jacob</a>, Briskin, Ben, and Saul and Becky. I’ve also met a lot of awesome people doing the workshops:</p>
<p><strong>Chicago</strong> – Ellee, Cori, Doogie, Cory, and Jay</p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong> – My bicepped studs Paul and Chris (with their better halves), Rowan, and Mark</p>
<p><strong>Monterey</strong> – Gabe, Nate, Mariah, Bill, Elliott, Harj, and Robin</p>
<p><strong>Australia</strong> – <a href="http://shirespeedandstrength.com.au/">Pete</a> (top fucking bloke), <a href="http://warriorperformance.com.au/">Shannon</a> (another top bloke), Harvey (awesome dude — see the trend?), Shane (both of them), Stuart — and all of you other fuckers. You guys were all great.</p>

<p>Lastly there are all of you who are watchers on the wall, never posting but quietly observing. When I meet you guys you always say, “Yeah, I read the site all the time, but never post.” Ah, that’s fine, but I welcome you to interact with all of us all the same. The interaction in this community is one of the best parts about running this site. We’ve managed to learn from each other, remain open to new ideas, accept newcomers, and encourage new lifters. Some of you have gone to meets, gotten stronger, or gotten better. Even though I don’t put up every e-mail that says, “Hey, you really helped me do this, thank you,” it makes it all worth it. It makes me sheepishly smile when some dude says they had a great fucking time at their first meet. The site started to help people with their training and I hope it’s done that for you, regardless of the amount of impact.</p>
<p>This site attracts the most fantastic and nicest people I’ve met in my life and if I believed in silly shit like luck and fate, I’d almost think I was lucky. 70’s Big thrives because you guys are here. My only complaint is that I can’t have a grand 70’s Big gathering to do a whole lot of ridiculous training, meat eating (earmuffs), and ale drinking (or can we…?). In any case, I appreciate all of you. In a hetero way.</p>
<p>I also like seeing your updates and PRs in the comments on <strong>PR Friday</strong> (which is today). I do read every comment that comes on this site, and I remember more of you than I should. I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. In any case, gg. See you out there.</p>
<p><strong>USAPL Raw Nationals</strong></p>
<p>is this weekend in Scranton, PA. Chris, Mike, Alex, Brent, and I will be there. Brent won’t be lifting because of a recent hamstring injury. Brent and I will be training (i.e. making our lats sing) somewhere on Saturday, so if you have any recommendations let us know here, the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig">fan page</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig">twitter</a> (the latter will show up on my phone).</p>
