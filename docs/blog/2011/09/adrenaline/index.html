There are two sides to a successful heavy lift: the volitional violence at a critical point in the lift coupled with a pre-existing shot of adrenaline. The former consists of gritting your teeth and ripping through each rep. The latter, however, is more of a skill that has to be developed over time. Considering that I’ve raised my heart rate by 50 beats per minute while sitting in a chair getting ready to squat, I’ll draw on my own experiences while combining some simple stuff I learned while studying sport psychology a few years ago.
Most people, especially stereotypical powerlifters, will use music as their source of external motivation. Even your average friend will have an image of a guy listening to inexplicable death metal and screaming prior to a lift that represents a similar range of motion to Stephen Hawking’s squat. This isn’t always the case, but douche bags — as well as mammoths — do exist.
Now consider the opposite side of the equation: the crafty champion. He is a man who wears an armored suit of serenity, yet his mind is full of wroth. He is courteous to the judges, undergoes his routine, seamlessly hits his lift, and pays homage to the crowd after a personal best. He has learned to summon the dragons from within.
Causing a raucous prior to lifting is a young man’s method of boosting his adrenaline; it’s more primal, easier to do. Yelling and flailing about is an external method of raising adrenaline, because the actions are typically associated with anger, action, and violence. Let’s learn how to develop the mental aspect of lifting.

<p><strong>Create a Routine</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever seen an Olympic athlete perform in person? They will do the exact same thing prior to each lift every single time. I’ve been at several meets with Chad Vaughn, a two time American Olympian in the 77kg class and gold medal winner in the 2003 Pan American Games, and each lift has the same routine regardless if it’s a training meet or a big meet. Weightlifting is inherently different than powerlifting, yet high level experienced powerlifters probably do this as well.</p>
<p>&lt;br/. In any case, set up a routine that you are capable of doing in any environment (your meet won&rsquo;t occur in your garage). Routines are a combination of physical and mental acts that breach the realm of preparing you psychologically and physiologically. You may approach the platform from the back, stop, visualize the lift in your head seamlessly three times, then approach the bar, set-up properly yet not slowly, and perform the lift. If you do this on every significant rep in training, then when you perform the routine at a meet, whether it&rsquo;s a local or nationals, it will emulate what you do every day in training. It will make things regular despite a judge staring you in the face, not having a mirror in front of you, or having a crowd of people in front of you. Most, if not all, successful single event athletes will have routines because they mentally prep them for success.</p>
<p><strong>Visualization</strong></p>
<p>That preparatory routine can merely be a physical action (i.e. approaching the platform, tightening the belt, shrugging the shoulders to remind yourself to finish the pull on a snatch), but it will be augmented significantly by some mental techniques. One of the easiest to use is visualization (also called imagery). This is just a mental image of <em>something</em>. It will be best if the lift itself is visualized with success, often including a single cue (similar to basketball players and free throws), yet can consist of…well, anything.</p>
<p>When I played football, I thought of blowing up a full-back who was trying to kick me out on an iso. Nowadays, it’s more general and includes more self-talk (next section), yet I like to visualize the cue itself. Instead of a full range of motion squat, it might be the specific explosive bounce out of the bottom. Instead of the entire snatch, it will be ripping through the second pull. AC has told me he imagines an army of zombies attacking people he loves (don’t ask). Much like general “pump-up methods”, I see an evolution of maturity in them. Early on, they will be focused on violence and mayhem, and later on they will be more specific and subdued. They focus on the success of the lift instead of a general heightening of systemic energy.</p>
<p>For me, visualization is just a quick image flashing in my head. I often combine several images as my adrenal intensity builds up over the course of a few seconds. I like to imagine my system ramping itself up like a whirlwind. As the whirlwind increases in intensity, I’ll use different types of self talk to make it specific to the type of lift I’m doing. Visualization is important — and works best when visualizing the successful lift itself — yet it is just a piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Self Talk</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t merely a simple, “C’mon! Let’s go! Yay!” This can be a combination of any word phrase that can increase your adrenaline. Again, early on, music was the inspiration for this, but I’ve been in gyms for over a year that not only don’t have music playing, but have TVs on (I hate TV). It’s hard to sum up the self talk that I use, because it’s so specific to each situation. It’s more of a stream of consciousness combined with certain aspects of visualization.</p>
<p>Self talk can consist something like Kirk Karwoski’s “I <em>own</em> that bar.” There was an article in Iron Mind that talked about how Kirk stared at his bar for ten minutes while listening to metal before he hit his top set of the day. For him, it was all about <em>owning</em> that fucking bar. It was <em>his</em>. And I think this can provide a good lesson: the self talk works in accordance with your overall attitude and visualization.</p>
<p>One method is to imagine the bar as your opponent; you <em>won’t</em> let it beat you. Other methods are to focus on the cue and let your mantra be, “Bounce…bounce…bounce…” as you go through your visualization. I consider myself pretty good at being able to pump my friends up, and I’ve used all kinds of methods. I’ve convinced them to prove someone wrong. I’ve convinced them to hit the lift for someone they’ve cared about. I’ve challenged them to not let the bar beat them. I’ve given them single cues to think about, and nothing else. These, however, are all externally provided to the lifter. You need to develop the ability to do it on your own when no one is watching.</p>
<p>This is why it’s so hard to articulate what works for me, because it’s something that has developed unique to me over time. I’m pretty decent at all different types of lifts, quick or slow, so my approach is more broad. Think about what really motivates you in the moment. Not what motivates you as you read this, sitting down and acting docile, but what motivates you when you have 15 seconds before you lift. I can think words like, “get this shit” and “bounce”, but often I just think of a swelling uproar while a mantra of phrases run through my head. Do you need to imagine you’re in an arena? Do you need to imagine you’re possessed? Do you need to imagine the battle of <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GBGXay-XpGc/Tf86FjMr-KI/AAAAAAAADvE/2ekvBmlup1s/s1600/Rhaegar%2Bvs%2BRobert.jpg" target="_blank">Robert Baratheon and Rhaegar Targaryen</a>? Does the situation itself provide enough adrenaline and you merely have to focus it into correct technique?</p>
<p>It’s possible that none of this is necessary. Brent is someone who is seemingly mentally quiet. Whatever he thinks about prior to a lift, it gets him ready most of the time (the other few times I think he would benefit from <em>some</em> excitement). The trick is finding out what you need prior to the lift and doing it. But it should evolve and adapt over time as your body adapts; acting like a silly savage won’t be acceptable forever. Figure out how to get yourself amped without the superfluous use of music. Besides, cavemen didn’t have music.</p>
