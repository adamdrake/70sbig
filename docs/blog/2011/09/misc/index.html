PR Friday
Remember that whole community thing from yesterday? Well, this community likes seeing how you do in training. Did you hit a lifting PR that you’ve been chasing? Are you reaching your body composition or weight gaining goal? Did you help people push their truck out of the road (something I did twice in 18 hours when in Texas — I forgot to mention it)?">

  <p>Unfortunately some of you thought this was related to the Misc forums. I’m not edemucated about that, but here are a few smaller topics.</p>
<p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Remember that whole community thing from yesterday? Well, this community likes seeing how you do in training. Did you hit a lifting PR that you’ve been chasing? Are you reaching your body composition or weight gaining goal? Did you help people push their truck out of the road (something I did twice in 18 hours when in Texas — I forgot to mention it)? Tell us about it in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Chicago Workshop Weekend</strong></p>
<p>I’m traveling to Chicago tomorrow to do the Workshop Weekend (Lifting on Saturday, Programming on Sunday) in Chicago. I worked on and improved the lectures on both days, so if you’re still interested in coming, there are a couple spots still open. <a href="/programming/workshop-weekend-chicago-sept-2425/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE FOR INFORMATION AND PURCHASE</a>.</p>
<p>When I travel I post things on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, so check those out. I am going to cry myself to sleep because I’ll miss a portion of the football games. I’ll just have Jacob Cloud text me drunken updates.</p>
<p><strong>Conan</strong></p>
<p>I’ve held an exact replica of Conan’s sword that was made by the son of the guy that made it for Arnold (in Spain, I think). This replica was sharp, heavy, and usable. It was also owned by a guy named Conan (I’m not making this shit up). It’s the same thing that Arnold used; at first they gave him some kind of lighter crap-sword, and he basically said, “Fuck that, I want the real deal.” In all of the scenes, Arnold is using a real, razor sharp sword.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5451" data-permalink="/blog/2011/09/misc/conan-1/" data-orig-file="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg" data-orig-size="400,304" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="conan-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg" src="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg" alt="" title="conan-1" width="400" height="304" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5451" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Tactical Strength Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Every now and then I drop the ball with something. For example, that whole trying to make several fantasy football leagues thing? Yeah, I dropped the ball there (<a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/leagueoffice?leagueId=362504" target="_blank">here’s the actual league</a> with some of the guys from the site including Cloud, Briskin, Chris, Kittensmash, and Stroup). But I didn’t realize how soon the official TSC was…it’s this weekend. Go to <a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com">www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com</a></a> to see the ruling on this even that has a three attempt max deadlift, maximum pull-ups, and max kettlebell snatches in a 5:00 time period. There are varying divisions for men and women (including weighted pull-ups and a heavier KB for the men’s elite division) as well as gyms holding official events this Saturday. I scrolled through and saw various acquaintances or friends in Sacramento, Denver, and Fort Wayne. The TSC is an interesting way to test yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>As far as recovery and nutrition are concerned, what are you deficient in? This could be sleep, water, protein, carbs, fat, vitamins, minerals, mobbing, etc. What is the thing that you need to improve?</p>
