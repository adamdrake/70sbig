Actually Getting A Girl To Train
It isn’t easy to get women to start training when their entire lives they’ve been given bad advice and false hopes (don’t believe me? see this). Throughout this series the readers have said, “That’s great, but…how do I get my wife/girlfriend/sister/friend to actually do it?” This post will provide a step-by-step suggestion guide on getting your friend to actually begin.
Before we begin, it’s important to note that the goal of this process is to help a girl train better and smarter while getting better results. You’re supposed to be helping and teaching instead of belittling her current methods, “mainstream fitness, or “society” (we can bitch about this stuff another time). Subtly reply to her doubts and skepticism in a proper, non-confrontational tone. In other words, we aren’t hysterically trying to convert anyone, but instead aim to help.
First, Present the Facts
In order to move onto the “how”, you need to first present the “why”. If possible, suggest that your lady friend read this amiable, friendly letter I wrote (I may re-write it soon to improve it since I wrote it a year ago — I’ll post it here when I do). I originally wrote it for a friend who coaches at CrossFits so that she could show her clients why lifting would be beneficial. Allow me to summarize:

A Summary of Strength Training Benefits for Women




All women go to the gym and workout in order to “tone up”, yet this term actually means getting “lean and strong”. More exercise and less food is not the key to getting “lean and strong”; instead, better and more efficient exercise is key. Strength and high intensity endurance training require an active metabolism to recover from and adapt. The higher levels of metabolism will help eradicate fat. The increases in muscle will augment that metabolism, but don’t worry, with less than 10% of the testosterone that a guy has and makes it IMPOSSIBLE to grow excessive muscle or get bulky. Strength training also produces the sexy, womanly shape that every gal aims for.


Getting stronger and eating a better, protein-filled diet will heighten metabolism, improve the immune system, prevent sickness, eliminate fatigue, and increase bone density. Not to mention it will result in being strong and conditioned to better enjoy an active, healthy lifestyle. Oh, and did I mention getting strong? I know many girls who are stronger than most men, and they are no longer simply “average”.

Notice how that summary didn’t even criticize conventional methods? It may be necessary to explain why not to do cardio for 45 minutes and eat granola for breakfast or elaborate on why protein and squats would help, but let’s keep it simple. Start with the minimum and avoid sensory overload. The above is a pretty convincing claim.
Second, Inspire and Motivate
No, I’m not suggesting you put on a Matt Foley performance, but a little inspiration can go a long way. After explaining the benefits of proper training, your friend may need convincing. Luckily, there are thousands of pictures and videos of great looking women — amateur or professional — who can inspire your friend. By now you’ll have a good idea of what she may aspire to look like, so start with women who fit that type. Obviously I’ve used pictures of Erin Stern recently because she isn’t grossly striated, is incredibly athletic, regularly strength trains (with lots of squats), and even does some versions of the Olympic lifts. I’ve even shown this pictureto a few girls and they are immediately motivated to buckle down and train hard.

<p>Inspiring someone provides emotional stimulation that compels them to want to get better. On the other hand, motivating gives someone an incentive to do something. The inspiration may be optional (depending on the gumption of the friend), yet motivating them to begin training is necessary. After all, strength training is a completely new method of ‘working out’ that is incredibly unfamiliar to most women. Despite the facts presented above, they may still be resistance. You merely need to ask them to only try it. That’s it. Just try it.</p>
<p>However, they can’t just try once since an afternoon of squatting and getting sore doesn’t beget results. Ask them to try it for a month. Committing to longer is a harder sell, and if they flat out deny a month, you can at least try to get them to try for two weeks (after six workouts, they will probably be sold anyway). Be sure to add, “If after a month of diligent work you don’t see any improvements and want to go back to your old method of working out, then you can. Just try this for a month.” You can probably get a confirmation with this approach, and most girls will be excited to try it (depending on how good or bad you are at making them comfortable with the idea, explaining it, and, most importantly, by not being creepy).</p>
<p><strong>Third, Eliminate Fear</strong></p>
<p>At this point, you have had a soft sell, but you can’t let your guard down. They may go home and realize that they have to venture into the “weights side of the gym” and get nervous. Girls don’t ever go over there. Won’t all the guys be watching them? Won’t squatting be hard? It <em>sounds</em> hard, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, squatting is inherently hard, but we’re not going to tell them that just yet. Instead, make them comfortable with the idea and the process. Ensure that you, or some kind of professional (that you have prearranged) will be with them every step of the way. Having a friend in an unfamiliar place makes that place seem less intimidating. Besides, you can explain that every guy in there doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing anyway.</p>
<p>If possible, introduce them to a female friend who already does train (for our new trainee is no longer “working out”, but training). This may be the single most important thing you do for your friend’s training future. If another girl who has been through this process before — and who may even walk her through it — helps her along in the beginning, it will prove that anyone can do it. Your friend may be aesthetically, emotionally, or psychologically inspiring. She may even be your friend’s new training partner or coach. Having another like-minded girl there will show her that this isn’t a guy’s world, but women can also excel.</p>
<p>If possible, introduce her to a group of these girls. It would be even better if they had a training group that got together a few times a week (I know several of these across the country). CrossFits are a great place to meet people who train hard, and nowadays many of them have strength specific programs that can help provide a community for your friend.</p>
<p>Some of these possibilities are dependent on your relationship with this friend and who will be coaching her, but now you have options. At the very least, cover one of the following bases:</p>
<p>A) Assuage fears by writing off the stereotypical male gym population</p>
<p>B) Ensure her that you will help them learn during this trial month</p>
<p>C) Introduce her to one or more like-minded girls and if possible have your friend join their training group</p>
<p>D) Clarify that anyone can do it. Show her examples online of people who have transformed their life and bodies by improving their</p>
<p>E) Remind her that strength training is a skill that everyone must work at, even for guys who write for super cool strength websites</p>
<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>
<p>If you, the reader, follow this simple and concise guide, I’m sure you will be able to get your friend to try this different style of training. Your friend will see quantifiable progress in their log-book, get stronger, and enjoy seeing the weight increase on the bar. Women are great to work with because they are very pleased with their ability to get stronger — probably because the world told them it wasn’t possible. Be sure to create a good program for your friend and go ahead and throw in high intensity endurance training that progresses over time (see <a href="/blog/2011/08/getting-girls-to-train/" target="_blank">this post</a> for female program creation and <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-2/" target="_blank">this post</a> for adding in conditioning). You’ll see that I don’t mind avoiding deadlifts…for now. It’s acceptable since she’ll still squat, and <a href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/" target="_blank">RDLs</a> will develop her posterior chain better than deadlifts in the beginning anyway. Don’t forget to tweak her diet, primarily by increasing her protein intake so that the body recomposes itself in our month-long trial (see <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-3/" target="_blank">this post</a> for nutrition for a new female trainee). Other things can be tweaked later, but if she plans her meals around eating protein, she’ll eat less of the other crap and get more of the good stuff.</p>
<p>Good luck with this process. Be sure not to be an elitist, a condescending prick, an irritating pain in the ass, or a zealot. Remember, you’re trying to help your friend improve the quality and efficiency of her training. Report back with results.</p>
