  <p>This week I want to motivate you women who actually do train, whether you’re already strong or not. You may be the queen in your gym, but somewhere out there a stronger woman is training her heart out. It just so happens that there is a gym full of these gals at <a href="http://www.crossfitretribution.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Retribution</a> in Westminster, MD. This facility is run by Beau Bryant (not to be confused with <a href="http://www3.images.coolspotters.com/photos/83115/bear-bryant-profile.jpg" target="_blank">this guy</a>) and he has developed a stable of good lifters and is even using The Texas Method (he bought <a href="/ebook/" target="_blank">the e-book</a> a while back).</p>
<p>This is Beau’s wife Angie hitting a fucking solid set of 225×3 on squat. I’m impressed, because this is a beautiful low bar back squat and she crushes the first rep. The neat part about it is that Beau sent me a video of her after last week’s Intensity Day and she missed the third rep at 220.</p>

</div>

<p>I just watched it again — god damn it what a great set. She doesn’t have any chest dropping due to thoracic weakness or hamstring weakness. Just real fucking solid. Well done Beau and Angie, well done. Oh, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj_5IqZWxR0" target="_blank">here</a> is their new shirt.</p>
<p>I could end the post and be very happy, but THERE’S MOAR.</p>
<p>Here is Tiff — she had no barbell training experience prior to joining the gym. Here she is pulling 290×5 like she’s drying her hair.</p>

</div>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idVItht6afQ&#038;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here’s a vid</a> of her squatting 275×3.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have the 110 pound mother of two, Leah squatting 160×1 a couple months ago. The record in her weight class is 170, so they are trying to break that.</p>

<p>Well done ladies, and nice job to Beau for good coaching and programming. If you want to submit your female lifting videos, shoot them <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
