<meta name="description" content="November is a magical month. Men across the world will forgo the confusing art of shaving and develop impressive and intense facial hair. Some may call it “No Shave November”. We have called it Novemburly. Many know it as Movember. Either way, you’re participating.
Movember started in 1999 and has developed into a month-long fundraiser for men’s health, particularly cancer. Cancer is a pestilent adversary and 70’s Big is joining the fight to kick it in the BALLS. Combine fighting and facial hair, and we’re there. However, this time it’s to raise money.
There are two ways you can participate: either create a profile and join the 70’s Big Fundraising team on us.movember.com, or donate to the team or one of our members. Either way, click here and get started (the team is on the right).
Edit: Even if you only donate one doll-hair, that will help. Various team members will be doing amusing things for donations, so keep an eye out.


  


Contest Prizes
Whoever raises the most money on the 70’s Big Movember Team will receive $50 bucks, a 70’s Big t-shirt, and their choice of one of my e-books or FIT. That’s right — raise the most money for a badass cause, grow some facial hair, AND get cash and 70’s Big gear. I’M GOING TO PAY YOU TO GROW FACIAL HAIR, SO GET STARTED.
Do I need to grow a mustache?
Movember emphasizes shaving at the beginning of the month and growing a mustache. Since Jacob Cloud and I already have sweet facial hair, we’re certainly not going to SHAVE it. Instead, grow whatever you want. If you have a beard, show it off. If you don’t, then either grow a ‘stache or don’t shave all month. Pick one, join the fundraising team, and LET’S FUCKING KILL CANCER.
And now a word from co-captain Jacob Cloud and his cat Weezer:
