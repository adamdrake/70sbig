Some of you were extremely generous in donating 100 to $150. Others dropped a few doll hairs, and that’s all we wanted. If everyone put in a few bucks then it would add up (every doll hair counts). Of the 47 team members 26 were able to receive donations that ranged from a single doll hair to 1,085 doll hairs. Some of you have written in to say that you donated directly to friends or family who are undergoing treatment for cancer — this is obviously even better as it directly helps those who are trying to kick cancer in the balls.</p>
<p>Thank you to the team members who stepped up and delivered. The top earners are also good friends of mine: Jacob Cloud ($1,085), Jacob Tsypkin ($946) and Ellee Carlson (who answered the call of female fundraisers to raise $641). Thanks to Cloud, Stroup, and Paul Sousa who have offered their lifting services to raise money. Jacob accepted pledges to pay out x amount per rep of a max set at 315. Here is his video:</p>

<p>Sousa agreed to watch a Twilight marathon if he broke $300 and agreed to deadlift a max set with whatever value he raised. It ended up being 320 doll hairs, so he pulled that for reps in this video:</p>

<p>Stroup apparently recorded his stuff but was born in the 1800s and can’t figure out how to play the sound? We’re still waiting on his video (he may re-record).</p>
<p>I will be doing my “lift-a-thon” this Thursday at <a href="http://www.panhandlecrossfit.com/" target="_blank">Panhandle Crossfit</a> here in Panama City. I’ll be streaming this event live on <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/user/Get70sBig" target="_blank">my Ustream account</a> <strong>at 6:00 PM EST</strong> (will also embed it here and link to it on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a>). This will consist of me doing clean and jerks with 300 pounds. As of now I have 49 reps to do. I’ll probably do them on a 2 minute clock so there will be time to dick around or field questions. We’ll also be recording on a separate camera for a quality YouTube vid. Oh, and I’ll be wearing a speedo.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who donated but we still have today and tomorrow to accept donations. Do so for the team or one of our members <a href="http://mobro.co/JLascek" target="_blank">HERE</a>. The cash/prize will go to the highest fundraiser who accepts the prize.</p>
