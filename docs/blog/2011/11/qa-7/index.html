<p>Dear artesuave (and others who asked about Chris),</p>
<p>Chris uses a double overhand hook grip for all pulling unless he needs straps (I’ve never seen him fail a weight due to grip). I’ve <a href="/blog/2010/04/quick-points-on-grip-strength/" target="_blank">talked about it</a> before a while back. Chris started as an Olympic weightlifter and has large hands, so he’s always pulled his deadlifts like that. I’ve seen him rack pull 600×5 with the hook — pretty insane. Before you go off and try to hook grip everything, just build it up over time because it WILL stress your thumbs. Some hand dimensions may be able to do it with heavy weight either.</p>
<p>When I started weightlifting (and using the hook) I had to tape my thumbs because the skin would tear, but nowadays I don’t. It’s just something you have to adapt to over time. The DOHG with deadlifting will more so stress the thumb ligaments than the skin since there isn’t torsion in the hand to scuff the skin.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear ngalfano13,</p>
<p>I had to go back and watch a video of myself to try and see what you were talking about. I’m merely just dropping slightly to catch the weight. If you rack a front squat, and then move into a quarter squat position, this is what I’m doing. If you don’t have as good a position, it could be due to your rack position. <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/?s=front+rack" target="_blank">Here are a list</a> of posts that Kelly has done on the “front rack” position.</p>

<p>Justin, could you impart some advice? [spoiler show=”Show rest of question” hide=”Hide all this shit”]I’ve been working out for ~1 year on the GSLP doing Sat, Mon, Wed (all at my ‘home gym’, Mon &amp; Wed after work). However I now attend football training on Wednesday nights. I’ve tried working out before work but find this really difficult (I feel weaker first thing in the morning, often my numbers actually go down from my previous evening workout! Maybe I just need time to adapt?). My schedule is as follows (Mon – Fri work until 6pm, get home at 7pm):</p>

<p>As you can see I have enough time to workout 4 days a week (Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue) but these are all consecutive and leave no days for rest. I’m open to working out 2 days a week but have been seeing good results on 3 days. I see you’ve previously mentioned an alternate ramping 3×3 and 3×5 programme. Why do you recommend this over 3×5 sets across each day?</p>

<p>I have very little programming experience but have put your advice (notably pressing technique) to good use before so was hoping you could help here. I’ll be sure to donate to your Movember campaign![/spoiler]</p>

<p>Dear chippy,</p>
<p>RE: weaker in morning training sessions</p>
<p>This isn’t abnormal, especially when you’re adapted to training in the evening. If I were coaching you I would have you eat differently to prep for a morning session and give you time to transition into consistently training in the morning. Also, I wouldn’t have you train on the morning that you have football stuff in the evening. I’d want you fresh for the football sessions regardless of how serious you are with it (don’t know if it’s high school, amateur, etc.).</p>
<p>RE: Greyskull</p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t have you running the GSLP. If you have three football training sessions (WED and SAT evenings and SUN morning) along with a standard work schedule, a regular linear progression is not going to function well. If you only have 100 recovery credits and the total cost of a linear progression + football training + work results in a payment of 125, your dick will be driven into the dirt eventually. If this football training includes contact or bruising, that will limit recovery even more (and increase the need for quality calories).</p>
<p>Also, the higher rep sets could take more out of you. If you were using a relatively medium weight, then the rep sets may not be a big deal. If you are using more challenging weights (where you get 5 to 8 reps on your final sets), then that will be particularly taxing in the context of football and work.</p>
<p>“But work isn’t physically stressful, Justin.” I realize, yet it’s still something you have to go do and requires at least some minimum level of stress that requires your attention and time. It could also constitute you sitting down for a large portion of your day (whether at your desk or while commuting) which will inhibit recovery due to mobility issues.</p>
<p>I’d modify the program and consider a twice a week split while you have three football sessions. You could also have regular training sessions on Saturday and Monday, but then do an assistance day (e.g. rows, RDLs, and chins) on Tuesday (your free day). If we were doing a consult, this would be the first thing I’d suggest (and get your feedback on it).</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to point out that I’m not a fan of deadlifting during a football season or during football training. I don’t know the extent of your football training, yet deadlifting is quite taxing from a localized (specific areas, in this case hamstrings, lumbar, and sacral areas) and systemic perspective. Put simply: doing deadlifts every week will not allow for optimal performance on the field. I’d suggest utilizing power cleans and RDLs until the football sessions decrease in frequency or you reach an “off-season”.</p>
<p><strong>Happy PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Post your training PR’s or updates to the comments. There’s some good football on this weekend; who are you pulling for and why?</p>
<p>All right, it’s 2:03 AM now. Don’t ever say I don’t care.</p>
