  <p>Monday’s are dedicated to displaying or helping female lifters and trainees. Today’s feature is a couple more regular women who are pretty damn strong. Jen Higgins of <a href="http://www.crossfitworks.com" target="_blank">CrossFit Works</a> sent me the e-mail but was mostly talking about how great of a lifter Liz Cameron is.</p>
<p>This is Liz pulling 286.5 lbs (130kg) weighing 114 (52kg weight class).</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l7uXzWWpmKc" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>That’s pretty solid technique for a max rep, especially for a female (round backs are the norm). Jen told me how Liz is about half her age, but was a great training partner as they readied for the 100% RAW Single Lift Worlds in Las Vegas. Liz’s best competition bench is 150lbs and her best competition squat is 220 (weighing 110). Liz has won the Best Female Lifter in the two meets that she’s competed in! She also teaches salsa dancing and apparently is “frequently sighted in short dresses and high heels”. Jen conveniently didn’t send pics of this claim.</p>
<p>All of this is high praise from Jen Higgins as she is also pretty damn strong. Here’s a video of her pulling a really clean looking 292.1 lbs (132.5 kg) in the 123 lbs/56kg weight class.</p>

<p>Well done, ladies.</p>
