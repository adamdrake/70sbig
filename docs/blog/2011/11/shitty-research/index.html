Abstract TL;DR — The researchers had patients (who were kids) that said that they hurt their backs while squats, so they performed a study to see if squats caused the “lumbar fractures of the pars interarticularis” that they found. The study itself observed the “pelvic incidence and tilt, sacral
slope, and lumbar lordosis while in normal standing posture and then during a front and back squat” in 20 volunteers. Here is a picture of the author, John McClellan.

  <p>I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Kinesiology with an emphasis in Exercise Science. It’s okay I guess. I knew that I didn’t want to pursue graduate work in this area of study because I wanted to coach, but I wasn’t impressed with the field itself. It’s just so BAD.

<p>The title of this news article is, “Squat lifts likely cause of stress fractures in young athletes, study finds”. We’ll soon find why this news article is just as bad as the study itself since this conclusion can’t be drawn.

<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Now let’s tear this apart. I’m upset to say that it was too easy. I made notes as I read the abstract itself. The first point I want to make: in my 13 years of training with barbells, playing football in high school and briefly in college, and training and coaching for the majority of it, especially the last five years, I have never seen or heard of this injury (pars interarticularis fracture). There is some merit to this statement as I’ve directly coached at least 50,000 squats in the last couple years and have seen many more over these years (along with performing at least 20,000 in training).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The number of incidence or rate or injury are not included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fracture healing is 3% for bilateral and 25% for unilateral pars fracturees. Sounds like the authors aren’t very good at healing this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How old were the males? Were they untrained? What experience did they have other than willing to volunteer? Why was it not relevant to include their mean age? Why can the results of using these males (who are undoubtedly over the age of 18) be generalized to adolescents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sacral slope merely indicates a back angle, and we can quite clearly assume it to change during a squat. A back squat will naturally have more of an incline than a front squat, so this “sacral slope” is completely irrelevant and tells us what we already know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the squat itself was not quantified whatsoever, any readings taken during the squat are completely irrelevant. There’s no way to know whether or not these researchers or subjects have any clue on how to do the squat. <strong>This is the biggest problems in most, if not all, squat studies: it’s never quantified. If you don’t quantify the movement, you cannot reproduce it in further studies or even know what standards the subjects were held to in the first place.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the sample size is too low to imply anything even if the researchers/subjects actually knew what they were doing to begin with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This study showed that the lordosis (or natural curvature of the lower back) decreased during the squats. This would appear to imply that the lordosis lessened, or in other words the subject slightly rounded his back. Everyone reading this site knows that lumbar flexion is not supposed to occur during a squat, and if that’s what this data means then the subjects are implementing it incorrectly. This, of course, would mean the whole study is erroneous and irrelevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The changes “would be expected” to increase “lumbar extension forces” and “play a role in pars fractures”. Of course the author of the news article (John Fauber) would turn this vernacular into “squats likely cause” fractures. If he had made any effort to analyze this from a scientific perspective, he’d see that this statement would absolutely not apply given the information presented. Furthermore, “expecting” something to happen isn’t science, it’s wishful thinking, so the fault lies with the researchers as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the researchers disagreed with the arguments thus far, then they should make their article freely available to the public instead of requiring payment and membership to read it. Doing so could validate their data, yet it would probably show how bad of a study this is. Regardless, this press release abstract shows how painfully erroneous all of these claims are. It not only makes them look like fools, but it makes John Fauber look like a complete dolt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This study ONLY displays information on changing of sacral slope during two movements that aren’t even quantified. No one else can replicate this study because of this lack of quantification. Additionally, it is pointing out what is already quite clear to anyone who has a mediocre grasp of musculoskeletal anatomy and strength training (meaning that we already know there is a change in back/sacral angle during squatting — this means that wasting time performing this study was a waste of time).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The study makes a grand leap of an assumption that squats are to blame for the adolescent injuries (a data point that isn’t quantified either). It assumes that squats cause the fracture instead of 100+ pound kids running into each other at full speed while in lumbar flexion or extension. It ignores the data that exists on incidence of injury in sport compared to weightlifting (weightlifting rate of injury is incredibly low when compared to very high rates of injury in other sports like soccer and football, see Starting Strength).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of all, it ignores the fact that an adolescent, especially when un-trained in barbell lifting, will not have good muscular or skeletal density around their spine and hips. Most kids don’t even know how to contract these muscles, much less hold them in place properly when applying or receiving force. These kids are then placed in inefficient positions — due to not having developed the musculature and skill to do so properly — and then making full contact with other kids or the ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bones and muscles will not increase their density or ability to withstand force without the application of stress. In order to make either stronger, they must be subjected to forces. There is no better way to strengthen these structures — both postural and force applyers — than a squat through a full range of motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High school football coaches are notorious for not teaching very good technique in lifting. For that matter, NSCA certified “professionals” aren’t that good either, and there are many examples of NCAA collegiate strength coaches who do a poor job of coaching correct lifting mechanics. This doesn’t mean that all high school or collegiate coaches are bad, but an overwhelming amount allow inefficient mechanics. This article assumes that there isn’t any fault in the coaches. Despite this lack of skill in coaching, the rate of injury is still low when compared to the rates of injury in sport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my 13 years of training with barbells, playing football in high school and briefly in college, and training and coaching for the majority of it, especially the last five years, I have never seen or heard of this injury.</p>
</li>
</ol>
