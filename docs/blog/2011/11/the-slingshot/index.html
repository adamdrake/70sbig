The curious thing isn’t that he’s speaking English, it’s that he’s using the slingshot. It’s curious because Konstantinovs is a raw lifter (and known for his deadlift if you’re a noob). I’ve seen Kelly Starrett talk about using the slingshot as well, and he even used it for an excellent “shoulder flexion with external rotation” mob.

  <p>Konstantinovs took a hiatus from posting videos on YouTube, yet he seems to be back with a couple of non deadlifting videos. I had read that he was going to go up a weight class and he certainly looks bigger. Check out this pretty simple 551 bench.</p>

<p>The curious thing isn’t that he’s speaking English, it’s that he’s using the slingshot. It’s curious because Konstantinovs is a raw lifter (and known for his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh-ikyBAQr8" target="_blank">deadlift</a> if you’re a noob). I’ve seen Kelly Starrett <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2010/11/episode-94365-bench-as-shoulder-er.html" target="_blank">talk about using the slingshot</a> as well, and he even used it for an excellent “shoulder flexion with external rotation” mob.</p>
<p>**</p>

<p><a href="http://www.howmuchyabench.net/" target="_blank">Mark Bell’s slingshot</a> was designed by Mark Bell to give geared powerlifters another tool to reduce joint stress and inflammation as a result of benching. It also allows them to handle an overload and teaches proper bench positioning — a great tool. He explains how it’s put on and used in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h24sNPIkroI&#038;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
<p>Geared powerlifters will often use a wider grip, wider than you should use for general strength training and sometimes wider than raw powerlifting. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE2aSmCFCjg&#038;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">This video</a> of powerlifters using the slingshot shows some of those wide grips; the fore arms will be angled outside of vertical when at the bottom ROM (most raw lifters should have vertical forearms at the bottom, pretty much like Matt Kroc in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7V43cPALGk" target="_blank">this video</a> of him trying the slingshot out. ). Once training regularly in this position, powerlifters can lift more weight due to the shorter ROM that the bar travels and the assistance of a bench shirt. More weight means victory, yet that bottom position has a lot of mechanical inefficiency that can place some funky stresses in the elbows, pecs, and shoulders.</p>
<p>Most powerlifters, raw or geared, don’t typically do any overhead movements in training (namely the press). I consider this to be an important lift that keeps the shoulder healthy and can help augment the bench by strengthening the triceps and anterior shoulder. I know many powerlifters, even as young as 21 years old, who have bad shoulders that they have to train around. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that anyone I’ve ever coached with (AC, Chris, Mike, etc.) don’t have current shoulder problems. I’ve even rehabbed Chris back from a severe shoulder injury that probably required surgery. All of my raw powerlifting friends will notice shoulder irritation and soreness when they reduce overhead pressing frequency when getting ready for a meet. I deem pressing important for powerlifters, but the point is that most powerlifters don’t press and this is why the slingshot really helps them.</p>
<p>It reduces the stress on the elbows, pecs, and shoulders by allowing the same or similar range of motion, yet helps those joints along their path. However, as Starrett points out in the link above, it helps force the shoulders into maintaining external rotation throughout the lift — something that you should be aiming for anyway. By maintaining external rotation, the structures keep a position that utilizes the triceps and distributes the load throughout the pecs while aiding the upward motion of the bar out of the bottom ROM. And this is why it will also help raw lifters.</p>
<p>I often see some nasty internal rotation on the bench and press, even among intermediate lifters who have been on a TM set up for more than a year (you know who you are). The bench can never flourish when performed with internal rotation, and the slingshot may be a good tool to learn that proper positioning. By chronically using proper externally rotated position — with the slingshot or not — the musculature will develop in a way that allows for proper positioning with heavier loads.</p>
<p>But the slingshot isn’t just something that could help a weak bencher that internally rotates; after all, Konstantinovs is a raw lifter using it for 500+ pound bench training. It’s a great tool for raw lifters too. Mark Bell says that it can allow about a 10% overload on bench. This would allow some overload whether for volume or intensity purposes. It could also help improve the bottom ROM of a bench, particularly with a pause. In higher intermediate or advanced levels of powerlifting, a lifter would identify which part of the ROM is his weak point: bottom, middle, or top. Technically the slingshot could help with all three, but I see even more utility to improve the bottom ROM strength due to the help it gives in that area. A trainee could use the slingshot on their intensity days to overload the musculature and develop the strength in that bottom positioning (this would be similar to using reverse band benches that increase the load at the top ROM to help with the lockout).</p>
<p>In any case, I find the slingshot interesting but I’ve never trained with it or coached anybody with it. Do any of you have experience with this tool? Have you used it? Played with it? Regularly use it? Let us know in the comments, because I’m interested to know more. And if you’re a powerlifter with internal rotation problems or have a few years of experience under your belt and need a training aid, I’d consider purchasing one.</p>
<p><em>Note: I don’t know Mark Bell and am not compensated in any way for this post (although I would advertise it), I just thought it was interesting and would open the discussion for those that have experience with it.</em></p>
