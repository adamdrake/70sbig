Duck Footed
I’ve always hated when people walk duck footed because it looks lazy, unnatural, and inefficient. I’ve noticed that I see it a lot in people who don’t have an athletic background. Dancers often do it because they are taught to be externally rotated in the hip constantly. It often results in collapsing the arch via ‘navicular drop’– the navicular is just a bone behind the base of the big toe on the inside of the foot and this term merely means it has dropped to the floor because of a lack of an arch (see picture below). Going barefoot or wearing flip flops a lot can also cause arch issues. Walking duck footed, or externally rotated in the hip, can also result in excessive loading of the hips instead of distributing the load evenly throughout the entire leg, hip, and trunk.

<p><strong>Why Does It Matter?</strong></p>
<p>Lifting is dependent on efficient force transfer. When the toes are pointed out and the arch collapses, the tibia/knee/hip internally rotates. If you squat with this internal rotation, then it places more stress on the medial aspect of the knee as well as distal quads instead of distributing the loud through the rest of the knee extensors and utilizing the hip extensors efficiently (not to mention the adductors of the inner thigh won’t be stretched to help extend the hip and the hip’s external rotators won’t be contracted to improve the tightness around the hip). Not only is it less efficient, but it’s injurious in a variety of ways because of where it shifts the stress of the force. Knees can get irritated, especially if they aren’t actively shoved out or the knees shift forward at the bottom of a squat because the stress is pin pointed on one side instead of moving through the joint evenly. Primary hip flexors like the rectus femoris, TFL, and parts of the glute medius can also get irritated from the knees shifting forward and in. The lumbar may also not be in proper extension when the knees collapse and some back issues can arise. In other words, problems can reverberate up from the knee all the way to the back as a result of a poor foot position.</p>
<p>If the load isn’t distributed evenly throughout the structures, then the muscles won’t get worked as well and the efficacy of strength training is blunted. In lifting, efficiency = safety = efficacy = strength.</p>
<p><strong>How To Fix Funky Foot Position</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you can do is stop walking with the toes pointed out. Point them forward. It will feel weird as hell at first, but you have to do it consistently enough to make it a habit. Consider the thousands of repetitions that occurred to make the “toes out/duck” position a habit; we need to reverse that. Improvement in toe position will help walking and running. Take a look at <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/11/episode-343365-stop-walking-like-the-duck-you-arent.html" target="_blank">this post/video</a> by Kelly Starrett for more on efficient gait mechanics.</p>
<p>While keeping the toes forward (in walking, standing, or running), think about loading the outside of your foot. Loading the outside of the foot will prevent that ‘navicular drop’, or arch collapse, and improve the knee and subsequent hip position. It also activates some other muscles in the shank (lower leg) while shifting where the force is applied. Definitely look at <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/12/episode-349365-what-if-we-just-used-a-joint-stabilityfunction-approach.html" target="_blank">this post/video</a> by Kelly to see an example of the difference between good and bad arch positions. Kelly shows that when you actively put the weight on the outside of your foot, the knees won’t collapse during a squat. It’s a combination of distributing the force appropriately through the thigh and hips and putting the structures in a better position to externally rotate at the hip. This is what “improving torque at the hip” means — a phrase used by Kelly in his videos. If you’ve been having trouble with your squat, pay attention to this concept and apply it in your training.</p>
<p>If you’re the type of person that has some knee pain when descending or climbing stairs, and you don’t have pre-existing injuries, then it isn’t something that is “natural” (especially for younger folks). It’s possible to reduce pain by a) improving positioning to distribute the force more efficiently and b) adapting the structures of the knee to withstand stress like running or jumping. The former is discussed in <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/11/episode-343365-stop-walking-like-the-duck-you-arent.html" target="_blank">this post/video</a> and primarily focuses on the same “lateral foot” and “knees out” concept. The “adapting the knees so they don’t hurt from jumping/running/etc.” discussion leaves the scope of this post, but constitutes a slow and steady progressions into activity that stresses the knees.</p>
<p>This post introduces the concept that foot articulation with the ground will dictate the body’s mechanics whether it’s squatting or walking. Soon I’ll do a post on foot drills and exercises that will help strengthen the arch and lower leg as well as help reverse the navicular drop habit.</p>
