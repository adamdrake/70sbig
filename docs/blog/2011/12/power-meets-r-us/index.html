Rory had a goal of breaking the collegiate American squat record in the 198 lb class. Jacob went to the meet to touch himself watch, but Rory’s coach/handler didn’t show up! The fuck? After pulling his beard in rage, Jacob stepped in and did a swell job handling Rory in his record setting quest.
Rory primarily used a Smolov squat cycle to get his squat up and pretty much neglected the other lifts. It worked well for him as he broke the record with a 230k (507 lbs) squat on his second attempt, and then got some cues from Jacob to come back and increase his record to 235k (518 lbs):

  <p>Chris and Mike did a meet this past weekend and Rory did one about a month ago. We’ll go in chronological order.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2011/10/another-awesome-day/#more-5536" target="_blank">Rory</a> had a goal of breaking the collegiate American squat record in the 198 lb class. Jacob went to the meet to <del datetime="2011-12-14T16:34:02+00:00">touch himself</del> watch, but Rory’s coach/handler didn’t show up! The fuck?

<p>Chris and Mike didn’t really taper for the meet and used it as a training day. Both had solid days. They ate at a shitty restaurant for breakfast and apparently it wreaked havoc on their stomachs. Chris cites this diarrhea as the primary reason his squats didn’t go as well. He went 622 and 639 on his first and second attempts, then on the third attempt at 650 he farted at the bottom and missed the rep. I’ll also address a small squatting issue in the programming and he’ll definitely hit 660 at the Arnold.</p>
<p>Chris then worked up to a simple 380 on his third attempt bench after not really pausing in training (although he recently doubled 385). On deadlift we did the normal “first attempt is last warm-up” around 585, then an intermediate jump around 622, then he took 307.5k (677) on his third for a routine pull. Chris went 8/9 with two meet PRs and he’s geared to have a great meet at the Arnold.</p>
<p>(There isn’t vid of Chris’ squats, so it’s just his third bench and dead)</p>

<p>Mike continued his streak of very successful meets going 9/9 and hitting PR’s of 573 on squat, 325 on bench, and 628 on deadlift. Just fucking outstanding. I’ve said this before, but Mike is very in tune with his training. He usually knows exactly what he’s capable of in a meet based on how his training has been going. Lately he has been utilizing ladders on his bench volume and high bar and front squats on his squat volume with a lot of success (they will be discussed in detail in the new e-book).</p>
<p>(This vid is only of Mike’s third attempts)</p>

<p>Great job all around for everyone. Briskin also did a meet and PR’d on everything, although he’s unhappy with his progress. Go to the Facebook Fan Page for some more pictures and shenanigans from Rory/Mike/Chris’ meets.</p>
