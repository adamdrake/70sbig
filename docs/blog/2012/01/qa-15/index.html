The Arnold Sport Festival
I think that ‘the Arnold’ will be a really cool experience since it’s a celebration of competitive events. This will be the first “70’s Big Meet Up” that isn’t a workshop, so I suggest you attend. Mike and Chris will be competing in the raw powerlifting event, I’ll be going, and Brent will be going. It’s also where this year’s senior nationals are for USA Weightlifting, and Donny Shankle will be trying to make the Olympics (which will be very fun to watch). There’s also all kinds of cool shit like strongman events and a pro deadlift challenge (which will also be neat as shit). Plus at least 20 other sporting events and that doesn’t even consider the expo itself (where tons of “fitness” or sport celebrities will be present) and the second biggest bodybuilding show of the year.
If you’re concerned about the cost of travel or hotels, then use the comments to see if anyone else near you is interested in going. We can help each other car pool or share hotel rooms and we can meet at certain events, restaurants, and bars. It will be tons of fun — I guarantee it. Because if it isn’t, I’ll make it fun by asking Derrick Poundstone what color his undies are.

<p>The following question concerns borderline pointless banter regarding the SOPA blackout this week. Since I don’t want to spam you down, it’s merely optional reading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m just confused as to the distinction you make between protesting about this, and the “Occupy” movement. Protesting is gay until you happen to agree with the cause?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear jayroc,</p>
<p>This is a valid question, even if I think it’s easy to see the distinction. First, I want to point out that I never said protesting was stupid, “gay”, or any such thing. When the “Occupy” stuff was dominating the news (and <a href="/blog/2011/11/take-it-ehsee/" target="_blank">when I mentioned it</a>), protesters were merely staying in spot without a goal. They weren’t doing anything and weren’t waiting for any specific thing to be done. They had a vague thing they wanted to be changed, but went about it like hippies who complain about “the man”. The SOPA protest had a very defined purpose: stop the bill(s) from passing. The end result is quantifiable. However, I considered it more of a way to raise awareness in order to stop the quantifiable result. You could argue the Occupy stuff raises awareness for…whatever you think they are raising awareness for, but when it was popular in the news they didn’t have a specific and quantifiable objective.</p>
<p>Lastly, all of the protesting I saw on January 18th helped people to go DO something in order to stop SOPA. Occupiers are occupying; that’s it. If I kidnap a famous person and am asked what my ransom is, and I say, “Ooga booga,” then how is anyone supposed to know what to do to get the person back? Realistically this is all moot anyway, because stopping SOPA was just a skirmish; <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/" target="_blank">the real war continues</a>. [/spoiler]</p>

<p>lets say the length of my femurs are the same as yours, and the length of my tibia was the same as yours,ie our legs are same proportions. HOWEVER…let’s also say that your torso was about 3 inches longer than mine. You LB squat, I HB squat. Would our back angles be similar? or am i leaving something out? physics is a little foreign to me at the moment (currently taking a physics class in college though). But I get that the difference between HB and LB has a lot to do with the back angle created by the bar placement. But i also get that the difference for most in placement of the bar is roughly 2-3 inches…. with that little of a difference, how is a persons anthropometry not the most important factor in bar placement/type of squat to use.</p>

<p>I say this because I HB squat, yet I feel I still use considerable amounts of hip drive and I don’t feel my body being as “upright” as one might think a HB should. I have a short torso.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all that being said, I do understand that if i were to LB, that would shorten my moment arm even further, creating an even smaller angle at the hips thus amplifying the qualities in a good LB squat. But i guess what I’m asking is, is it possible for a HB squat to resemble a LB squat/involve more posterior chain than it “theoretically” does, due to a persons build?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IF, IF, IF, my logic is correct, and someone with a short torso is LB squatting, is it possible for that person to be TOO posteriorly dominant in the squat, therefore requiring assistance exercises for the quads, in the same vein that theoretically a HB squatter requires say an RDL to make up for the anterior dominance of the HB squat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> He’s asking about squatting mechanics with different torso lengths, his feeling of hip drive on HB squat with a short torso, and asking if someone can be posteriorily dominant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear criedthefox,</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why someone should be kicked in the dick, but asking a question about squatting mechanics isn’t one of them. First, if we had the same body dimensions, yet my torso was three inches longer, my squat would be vertical. Theoretically the bar still needs to remain over the middle of the foot, and a shorter torso will require more inclination to put the bar in that position than a longer torso, regardless if they are both considered longer torsos. The change in this hypothetical example may be negligible, but there would be a small degree of difference in angle. You can test this with a ruler. Place two dots on a piece of paper three inches from one another. The longer torso represents the tip of the 12 inch ruler while the shorter torso represents the six inch mark on the ruler. Make the bottom of the ruler sit on one dot, and lean the 12 inch tip so that it is vertical over the second dot; see how vertical it is? Now make the six inch mark learn so that it is vertical over the second dot; see how there is significant inclination. With other body dimensions constant, the longer torso will be more vertical, even if it’s only marginally longer.</p>
<p>Since you say you have a short torso, I can assume you have more forward inclination than someone with short femurs and a long torso. As a result, you will likely have more posterior chain involvement, especially if your mobility limits you from getting vertical. A lack of mobility in the ankles, knees, and hips can reduce how vertical someone is in a high bar, front, or overhead squat. Since you feel more posterior chain involvement, I will go ahead and assume that you don’t have great mobility (stretch your ankles and external hip rotators next squat session and see if it changes anything). To answer one of your questions: yes, the high bar squat can resemble a low bar squat if the person has long femurs and a short torso along with poor mobility. In contrast, a low bar squat can also have high bar mechanics if the person is too vertical.</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s possible that someone can be too dominant in their posterior chain, but highly unlikely. Instead, what we see more is that increasing quad strength can help the low bar a bit, but that doesn’t mean they were necessarily weak in the anterior. Since the posterior chain is much more important in athletics and movement (via hip extension), I’d rather see someone with a bias towards the posterior as it signifies solid hip and lower back structure as well as strength. There are many successful athletes that have gotten by with weak posterior chains; the question is whether or not it promoted specific injuries more than had their posterior chain been stronger. However, if someone was interested in Olympic weightlifting and primarily low bar squatted, then they will need some kind of vertical squatting to develop their “anterior chain” to be successful. When I was transitioning into weightlifting, I squatted around 500 low bar and my first few front squat sessions were around 315 to 335, yet I worked it up to around 400×2 (to give you an example).</p>

<p>I’ve just added light RDL’s (135#) to my programming as a assitance lift (I’m doing 5/3/1) and trying to use correct form based on resoures such as 70sBig and Rip’s video on the SS website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My problem is I feel I am hitting the hamstring on the longer leg a lot more than the shorter leg. I’ve played around with my form and taking a wider stance and/or wider grip on the bar seems to allow me to spread the load more evenly, but I’m not sure if this is a good idea or not wrt getting the most benefit out of the lift. Is this approach OK? Any better ideas?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d assume that it’s best to spread the load evenly across both legs/hamstrings as much as possible, but on the other hand, perhaps when I am squatting and deadlifting this same uneven distrubution of load is occuring and therefore the “dominant”(?) hamstring needs to be stronger? Is that crazy talk??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Josh,</p>
<p>Since one of your legs is longer — which isn’t uncommon — you did well to try and distribute the load. However, it probably isn’t evenly distributing that load since you still have a short leg. You’re merely finding a new foot position that makes the structures feel as if they are trained evenly. Instead, find a shim that is as close to the difference in leg length as possible under the shorter leg. That way your shorter leg will be even with the longer leg and you can use a normal stance. At Rip’s gym we used pieces of rubber floor matting (they were probably 18″x18″x3/4″). You typically want the mat to be at least twice the surface area of your foot so it doesn’t slide on the floor as you’re lifting (which will result in either death or a torn scrote). You should probably use it on squat and deadlift too, since those will be even more affected by your leg difference. The worst case scenario is that you load your hips and spine weird over time and develop tightness in one side of your back.</p>
<p>Reader <em>track</em> also pointed out that leg length differences can also represent pelvic weirdness (rotation, tilt, etc.) and he recommended a chiropractor. This is a good idea to confirm if your legs are different sizes or if it’s a pelvic difference.</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2012/01/the-repeated-bout-effect/#comment-22157" target="_blank">Maslow asks:</a></a></em></p>
<p>So say you are on a 3- or 4-day per week program. You get extremely sore and are experienced enough to know that you absolutely will not be able to work through it to complete your scheduled training, so you do a quick light day. Do you return to the gym the very next day to attempt your scheduled work from the day before, or take a day off?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Maslow,</p>
<p>I’d probably take a day off and consider making the next training day lighter than it was supposed to be. If you’re just sore, then think about why. Not enough protein and not hydrated well? Not good sleep? Just came back from a layoff (if this is it, then you did too much too soon and need to use the easy progression up)? Diagnose why. If you are just mysteriously sore, then you probably have too much shit in your program. If you’re on a TM, and are mysteriously sore, then look at the volume day(s). Soreness is information that is relevant to track in your log, and if you don’t know why it’s there then you may be doing too much.</p>
<p>Note that the “quick light day” probably should occur on a normal training day as opposed to doing it on your rest day. In other words, I probably wouldn’t have you do this:</p>
<p>Training Day</p>
<p>Normal rest day — fucking sore, go to gym and do light stuff</p>
<p>Instead, it would be this:</p>
<p>Training day</p>
<p>Normal rest day — note overwhelming soreness</p>
<p>Normal training day — adjust session to account for overwhelming soreness. This means if you didn’t plan to squat, and your quads or groin are blown up, then do some light squats. If you were supposed to squat heavy, warm up and if you’re structures are too damaged to lift heavy then hit some light squats and move on.</p>

<p>Should I do a GPP approach w/non eccentric conditioning the first week with moderate volume &amp; low intensity? Definitely need some insight on this as I do not plan on doing any heavy squatting or pressing/pulling.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be in Europe so maybe walking and body weight exercises will be utilized to maintain some level of fitness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear jarhead316,</p>
<p>If you’re going to have a high tempo European vacation, then don’t worry about extensive training. Hit some push-ups, pull-ups, or body weight squats when you can, but don’t take significant time from seeing Europe in order to “train”. It’s still just body weight shit and it won’t be accomplishing a whole lot (unless muscular endurance is a goal, but still you shouldn’t sacrifice seeing Europe for that). If you have a lazy type trip (where you aren’t bouncing from city to city) and are intending on training in some cool places outdoors, you could do sprints, plyo jumps, and burpees (note that plyo jumps are NOT conditioning).</p>
<p>But your question was for your return. If you primarily like to lift with some conditioning added in (which is my assumption?), there’s not reason you can’t lift on that first week back. However, as the <a href="/blog/2012/01/the-repeated-bout-effect/" target="_blank">Repeated Bout Effect</a> post suggested, just do a light day. Two or three sets of five with warm-up weight with squat, press, and maybe deadlift will give you a nice little stress that won’t be damaging. Then if you want you could do some conditioning after that (since a few light sets should only take 15 or 20 minutes). The second session two days later can be similar, but a bit heavier weights, and the third can be similar with medium weights. The following week you should be good to work up to a bit under where you left off, then the second workout of the second week should be where you left off. If you do it that way, you’ll feel revitalized through the progression instead of feeling like ten pounds of pounded asshole.</p>
<p>Also, since you won’t have a systemic lifting stress during your vacation, your metabolism will receive a nice spike after that first lifting session. You’ll feel better if you do it this way. Contrast that with doing too much and you’ll only depress your system, which is an invitation to the gout. Yeah, you’ll contract the gout; it’s weird, I dunno.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andre C. asks:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me as sedentary people age they complain more about soreness throughout thier bodies, could the repeated bout effect be working here at their level of deconditioning causing soreness with extremely low work intensity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because sedentary people are adapted to very little. As they age, they further adapt to a lack of stress. Compound that with a shitty diet and the downward health spiral continues. The Repeated Bout Effect just states that doing a bit of work will produce an adaptation so that subsequent work doesn’t induce as much soreness. The aging sedentary person isn’t doing anything whatosever, therefore anything they do will make them sore. I wouldn’t say the Repeated Bout Effect is relevant, since it more so relates to a purposeful act of training, but we could say that something more than what they are adapted to is the first step of the Repeated Bout Effect. In other words, climbing three flights of stairs induces a stress the sedentary/lazy person isn’t adapted to that makes them sore, but technically — as with all stresses — it’s something that the body will try to adapt to so that the next time they do it, it will be easier and cause less damage.</p>
<p>Instead, think in terms of what the person’s current state of adaptation is with respect to the stress they impart on their body. “Stress” can also be “a lack of stress”. This is why a sedentary or older person’s muscles atrophy and bones decrease in density; those structures aren’t experiencing a mechanical stress that would maintain or increase their strength and density, so they weaken because of not receiving stress. That’s why it’s so important for old people to exercise. For my grandma, exercising might be standing up and sitting down ten times in a row. For others, it might be walking for ten minutes. When the application of stress stops, so does any positive adaptation.</p>
