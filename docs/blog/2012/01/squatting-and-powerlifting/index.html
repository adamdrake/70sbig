I’ve taken a variety of lifters to many meets, including two raw national meets with the USAPL. If I make a mistake in the geared squatting discussion, feel free to correct me if you’re involved in the sport.
When people think about squatting powerlifting, they’ll probably think of a multi-ply geared squat that isn’t taken very deep. While I’m not a fan of gear, there are many great people in the geared powerlifting world (e.g. Mark Bell and Donnie Thompson). It’s just a different way to train and express strength, yet the standards make it hard to compare one squat with another squat. Apparently SPF judges their squats by the bottom of the hamstring getting to parallel. This is very different than what USAPL/IPF requires with “the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of the knees”. At this point the geared squatting is almost like a different sport because the standardization of what constitutes a squat is different.
Geared squatting typically utilizes mechanics that utilize the maximum potential of the gear; the lifter would be stupid not too. It’s like a NASCAR team not improving their engine to the potential they can; it would result in losing. Squat suits resist hip flexion and therefore help hip extension. When the hip flexes in the descent of the squat, there is compression about the hip that applies a force to aid in the extension of the hip. Therefore the lifter should squat in a way that applies the most hip flexion. The lifter also wears knee wraps to help extend the knees, yet there will be more aid from the suit itself so the “acute hip flexion” squat mechanics are used. This is why we don’t see geared high bar squats; high bar squatting has a more obtuse hip angle and doesn’t use the suit to it’s full capability. The high bar squat would have more knee flexion, yet the suit is under utilized with these mechanics.
The result is a squatting style with a very wide stance (which may have developed to account for larger lifter’s bellies), vertical shins, and an inclination of the torso that creates acute hip flexion. This is what we see in all of the 900&#43; squats with multi-ply gear. I know many of you are gear haters, but understand that multi-play gear is completely different than single ply gear. “Single-ply” describes the thickness of the material of the “gear”, or squat/bench/deadlift suit. Standard USAPL fits under IPF ruling, and the IPF uses single ply gear.

  <p>We’ll continue this three-day discussion on squatting by looking at squatting in the sport of powerlifting. In case you missed them, check out the <a href="/blog/2012/01/low-bar-vs-high-bar-squatting/" target="_blank">High/Low Bar Comparison</a> and <a href="/blog/2012/01/squatting-and-weightlifting/" target="_blank">Squatting in Weightlifting</a> posts.

<p>When people think about squatting powerlifting, they’ll probably think of a <a href="/blog/2012/01/squatting-and-weightlifting/" target="_blank">multi-ply geared squat that isn’t taken very deep</a>.

<p>The result is a squatting style with a very wide stance (which may have developed to account for larger lifter’s bellies), vertical shins, and an inclination of the torso that creates acute hip flexion. This is what we see in all of the 900+ squats with multi-ply gear. I know many of you are gear haters, but understand that multi-play gear is completely different than single ply gear. “Single-ply” describes the thickness of the material of the “gear”, or squat/bench/deadlift suit.

<p>Personally, my preference is still with raw lifting, but USAPL/IPF competitors squat with a modified “low bar squat”. The stance is a bit wider, the grip is different (thumbs are wrapped, usually closer grip), and the eye position is different (never down, but forward). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwuSTqA1FlU" target="_blank">Here is a legitimate squat</a> that counted for a WR in the 82.5 class in 2010.</p>
<p>Below is my buddy Brooks Conway, an 82.5 USAPL lifter, squatting a raw 407×5 ezpz. This video represents the same squatting style that he uses with gear (suit and knee wraps). I point it out because it’s just what we refer to as “the low bar” with different eye position and grip. He lifts at <a href="http://www.quest-athletics.com/" target="_blank">Quest Athletics</a> and is coached by Sherman Ledford. Sherman has coached/handled many IPF World Champions and World Record holders and this is how he teaches his lifters to squat. Note the shoes Brooks is wearing — Sherman also has his lifters wear what is essentially weightlifting shoes for squatting (not deadlifting).</p>

</div>

<p>As a side note, I see utility in the grip that Sherman teaches and that Brooks uses. The “low bar” has a wider grip with the elbows up to create a shelf with the rear deltoids (Sherman expressed his dislike for this as it encourages the bar to be dumped over the lifter’s head, but I’ve never seen this with decently coached lifters, and my friends have squatted up to the low to mid 600s raw). Instead, I see more utility in the fact that the elbows are pointed down, and then the lats are contracted (look at Brooks in the vid, he ‘tightens down’ before each rep). Consciously contracted lats would make for a stronger and tighter torso. The only issue would be that the wrists are in a compromised position, so wrist wraps would probably need to be worn (I think Brooks is wearing them in this video, I’ll get him to confirm). In any case, the point is that good single-ply lifters lift the same in their gear as they would raw. They will always be strong out of their gear too. Whereas some multi-play, wide-stance squatters are unable to squat impressive numbers to deep depths (since they train to squat high), the single-ply guys are impressive raw.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the next point; raw squatting is best done with the “low bar” mechanics. This is what Alexey Sorokin uses in the 380k WR squat above, and it’s the same thing that Brooks uses in the video above. It’s the same thing that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrGIh84HBzg&#038;list=UUs9S1Uqx7vYYzzQFkf5qcAg&#038;index=5&#038;feature=plcp" target="_blank">Mike Tuchscherer</a> does (albeit with a slightly wider stance). It’s the same thing that Chris has used to squat 644 in competition and what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXeT2KckW7c&#038;feature=plcp&#038;context=C3e867caUDOEgsToPDskLh5hFn3mhnSkGb2zeKK8Nl" target="_blank">Mike used to squat 573</a> (he’s missed more on a questionable depth ruling). It is superior than a wide stance, shin vertical style of squatting because it balances the application of force across the anterior and posterior aspects of the hips and thighs. Wide stance squatting doesn’t put the external rotators into contraction and it provides a different stretch on the adductors than they get when the stance is not wide with the knees shoved out. The knee position is also different as a result of the non-wide stance, so the quads play a greater role in the low bar compared to a wide stance, shin vertical suited squat. This is also why it’s funny to a lot of people (including me) that a portion of the CrossFit community learns the wide stance squatting from Louie Simmons (keep in mind that the majority of the CF community employs efficient high and low bar technique too). “Low bar” squatting mechanics is the most efficient for raw or single-ply squatting. The only difference are the cues employed to have an end product of “low bar” mechanics.</p>
<p>But what about high bar squatting? Some guys are very successful with high bar mechanics in raw powerlifting. The coolest video is Andy Ruse squatting 462×20 below. Andy <a href="http://youtu.be/i7T-s73UUBs?t=2m8s" target="_blank">would later squat 672</a> after a Smolov cycle (don’t know what he could deadlift at that strength). He squatted 639 and deadlifted 683 in a meet in late 2009 (he missed a 661 squat that meet). Unfortunately he has since had to have another surgery to clear bone spurs in his elbow and <a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=118490371&#038;page=53" target="_blank">is no longer going to be powerlifting</a>.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbFGdpQD_O0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The first problem I see with high bar squatting in powerlifting is that the high bar creates an anterior dominated lifter, and this could hurt his deadlift potential. After watching Andy deadlift and do some assistance stuff, I wouldn’t say he’s weak in his posterior chain, but his quads are just so damn impressive that the net result is being anterior dominant. Had he made the 661 squat in that linked video above, his deadlift would only have been 22 pounds above his squat, which is interesting for a raw lifter. While guys can get very, very strong with the high bar, it may blunt their deadlift potential because of the reduced posterior chain involvement in the high bar squat. If that work is present via low-bar mechanics, then it can augment the deadlift training.</p>
<p>Lastly, body dimensions can dictate how successful a lifter can be in a given squat style. A lifter with a long torso and short thighs will have greater success with vertical torso squatting than a lifter with a short torso and long femurs. Long femurs will push the hips back further and the short torso means the lifter has to lean over more. Contrast that with short femurs and a long torso, and this lifter doesn’t have to lean over as much in any squat form. This means that long femured lifters won’t have as much success with front squatting or high bar squatting compared to their short femured counterparts. This may also be why a long femured lifter can benefit from doing some vertical torso squatting; his quads are less effective because of the longer muscle belly and the inefficient position (from having to lean over more). By using the high or front squat, he can improve his quad size and strength to assist in the existing low bar mechanics he uses in competition. This is exactly what Mike has been doing over the last few months, and it’s solidifying his squat (he aims to hit at least 600 at the Arnold in the 275 class).</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the discussion and analysis on squatting over the last few days. Squatting is a fantastic exercise that can be done in different ways to prepare for different things. All in all, just make sure you’re getting under the bar and squatting twice a week (overhead squats don’t count; not enough of a load).</p>
