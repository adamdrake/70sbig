Pendlay even said, “God would need to strike down four or five of the best lifters in order not to earn it.” He even said that if everyone had a bad day then the spot would still be earned. However, earning a spot is still dependent on performing reasonably well at the Pan Am Championships to lock a spot up.

    Olympic hopeful Donny Shankle rests with Jon North between attempts

<p>Average weightlifting fan says, “Wait a sec, didn’t they just do the Pan Ams a few months ago?” The event from a few months ago was the Pan American <strong>Games</strong>, which occurs the year before the Olympic year. Every non Pan Am Games year is just a Pan Am Championship, and that’s what’s happening in late March.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that we have that spot. Each lifter vying for that spot is compared to a standard in their weight class. The top three finishes in each weight class for the last few years are averaged together to make the standard. The American Olympic hopeful is then compared to that average via a percentage. Pendlay told me that based on recent totals, Kendrick Farris has about 90% and Donny Shankle has about 89%. There are, of course, other lifters like Chad Vaughn (two-time Olympian), Matt Bruce, and Zach Krych who have a shot, yet the hurdle for them is to significantly improve compared to what they’ve done in the past.</p>
<p>All of those men have two opportunities to post their best total to count towards making the U.S. Olympic team: Nationals at the Arnold (AKA ‘the Olympic trials’) in the beginning of March and the Pan American Championships at the end of March. This means that the men are more or less battling against each other to have a higher percentage of the world average (for their weight class) to earn the spot to go to London. In other words, it’s kind of a big deal. And that’s why Nationals are going to be “very interesting”, according to Glenn.</p>

    Olympian Kendrick Farris will battle for a spot this March
  </p>
</div>
<p>As of now, the front runners are Ferris and Shankle. Unfortunately, Farris hasn’t had a great showing in his last few meets. On the other hand, Donny has been training very well. I don’t know what Farris is currently putting up, but Shankle totaled 380 last Friday. For Shankle to beat Farris’ current total, Shankle would need to total 381 (meaning he’s very close). However, Farris has the same two opportunities Shankle has to improve. Every bit Farris improves, Shankle will have to improve that much as well. Shankle has a real chance to be the lone wolf representing the U.S. men’s team. The whole thing will be really fun to watch, and best of luck to Kendrick, Donny, and the rest of the men battling for a spot.</p>
<p><strong>Women’s Team</strong></p>
<p>The women have already earned two spots to the Olympics. Currently Sarah Robles is sitting on top and will most likely go (I’m glad she came back from that clarking fiasco from the Pan Am games when she went to World’s). However, the spots aren’t exactly locked up. Rivera (sp?) and Holly Mangold could knock someone down. Danica Rue and Amanda Hubbard are also close. There are several lifters that could perform really well to earn their spot. If anyone has any specifics, then let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, keep in mind that Nationals are occurring at the Arnold this year. This will be an excellent time to not only hang out with other 70’s Big readers, but to see a variety of sports — including the weightlifting meet that may decide which guy goes to the Olympics.</strong></p>
