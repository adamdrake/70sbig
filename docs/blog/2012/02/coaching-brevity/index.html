<p>CrossFit has increased the number of coaches in the world significantly, and many of them come from non-coaching backgrounds. This may be one of the reasons that a trend in CF coaches is that they are long-winded and wordy. A few reasons that cause Faulkner-esque coaching include group classes, “explaining it all”, and a lack of a triage.</p>
<p>CrossFit inherently consists of groups. There is a group leader getting the group to learn and move a specific way. Often there are attendees with very different skill levels that the instructor needs to worry about. Furthermore, the instructor — who is very passionate — aims to try and explain every aspect of the movement. The instructor very much wants each person in the group to understand it the same way that they do. This often leads to sensory overload, especially with less experienced trainees. Instead, aim to triage what you’re coaching: what’s the one or two most important aspects of what I’m trying to teach?</p>
<p>Instead of explaining how to un-rack the bar, how to walk it out, and how to set up, just have the trainee do it. Besides, you should be teaching them to do it with an unloaded bar anyway, so these frivolous details can be taught later. <strong>The approach to teaching a movement should be as brief and concise as possible while teaching the most important aspects of the movement</strong>. Stop and consider each movement. Why are you using this movement in your training? Does it use a lot of musculature to use a lot of energy during conditioning? Is it to make the hips and legs strong? Now consider what cues are necessary to accomplish that goal and help the trainee grade out at a “B” with their technique. If the list is long, only select the top two. Does your teaching method focus on those two things? If not, how will you trim it to do so?</p>
<p>The teaching method is important since it initially establishes how quickly (or not) the trainee will perform a given movement. However, the cuing that occurs on a day-to-day basis is equally, if not more, important. <strong>Cues are short reminders to the trainee to do something during a movement to make it better</strong>. It’s okay to explain the concept in detail, however the concept needs to be immediately whittled down to a cue. Shoving the knees out while doing any squat will avoid hip impingement and ensure that the body’s force is more evenly distributed throughout the thighs and hips, but the cue only needs to be “knees out”. Furthermore, the cuing for a squat shouldn’t be, “big breath, chest up, knees out, bounce” (among others). Instead, <strong>focus on one or two of the most important that are going to elicit success on the next set</strong>. If needed, reinforce those same cues at appropriate times during the set. Note that introducing separate cues during the set will typically be unhelpful and usually make the movement worse. Freestyle cuing should only occur with experienced lifters who have received that cue numerous times in the past.</p>
<p>After the set the coach should mentally evaluate how well the lifter performed the two cues that were established prior to the set. If one of the cues became routine or automatic, it can be dropped from the “active cue” list and the coach can focus on the other established cue or a new cue. However, if the single remaining cue is still an ugly fault, the coach shouldn’t introduce a new cue; more variables in the equation results in sensory overload.</p>
<p>Lastly, the coach should have a primary goal for their lifter(s) in a given movement during a session; it should be relative to to the lifter’s skill. For example, when I teach the power clean in the workshops, I aim for each attendee to a) jump the weight up properly and b) rack it properly. While “jumping” may not be a good advanced weightlifting concept, most attendees are using the power clean for general strength and conditioning purposes (aiming to use the power clean for loaded power development). And even if they weren’t, getting their bodies to move a weight because their legs and hips did it instead of their arms is an important concept.</p>
<p>A specific example is Lisa from this past weekend. As I say in the video description, she was unable to go through the standard teaching progression very well. She was arm pulling (the worst habit to have in the clean or snatch), donkey kicking, and not jumping very well (she would remain in hip flexion). Essentially it was an uncoordinated mess because she had too many variables in her head. Instead, I just simplified it to “crayola style” and helped her develop an okay power clean. (Read the info of the video)</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HH56ljnmEs" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>No, there’s not anything special in this video. It was recorded because Lisa was interested in how her movement looked. I don’t typically stand 10 feet away, hold a camera at waist level, and coach through the viewing screen of a video camera, so my method of cuing is a bit bland here, but the point was to cue very simple things for Lisa to do in a simple progression to get her to emulate the two primary principles in the power clean (explained above).</p>
<p>If I had gone up to her and explained every deficiency in her movement, then her confidence would have dropped and she would have had many variables to consider instead of one or two. Instead of saying, “Don’t donkey kick or pull your heels up,” when jumping, the result would have been different than having her do something that eliminates the fault to begin with.</p>
<p>Whether you are coaching a beginner or a regular trainee, it’s unnecessary for each cue to comprehensively address everything in the movement pattern. Instead, be concise and brief. Your brevity should focus on the things that have the greatest impact on the success of the movement. Focus on or two cues that actively tell the lifter to do something. When you do it right, the cues address the conceptual explanation that you have already established (even if the explanation occurred two minutes prior). As the number of trainees increase, keep your goals and cues even more concise. If one attendee is excelling, then you can cue them individually for the next point of emphasis…as long as it’s done with brevity.</p>
