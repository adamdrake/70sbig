You can view all of the results HERE.
The primary method of admission to this meet for USAPL members was to lift at the 2011 Raw Nationals and have at least a 375 Wilks total. Only 75 lifters were accepted including Chris, Mike, and Alex. Alex originally planned to lift in the 105kg class, but decided he didn’t want to lose at least 20 pounds, so moved to the 120kg class. Mike originally was going to lift in the 120 class, but figured he would only be able to make 5th place in either class (based on his top numbers), and decided not to worry about losing the weight (he weighed in at 280, so about 16 pounds over the 120/264 limit), especially since he has to do so for an Air Force PFT every six months. Chris lifted in the 120&#43; class.

  
  
    L to R: Chris, Mike, and Alex wait to be called for final squat warm-ups
  

All three of my guys were lifting in the same flight. I’ve handled five lifters in the same meet before, yet they were in different flights or sessions. Having three guys in a flight of 15 was a different experience. There were times when Alex and Mike were following each other and Chris was up only five attempts later. I actually missed coaching Alex’s first squat because I was putting Mike’s second attempt in at the table.

  <p>The 2012 NAPF Raw Challenge is sanctioned under the <a href="http://www.adfpa.com/IPF-NorthAmerica/" target="_blank">North American Powerlifting Federation</a>, which is under IPF ruling.

    L to R: Chris, Mike, and Alex wait to be called for final squat warm-ups

<p>All three of my guys were lifting in the same flight. I’ve handled five lifters in the same meet before, yet they were in different flights or sessions. Having three guys in a flight of 15 was a different experience. There were times when Alex and Mike were following each other and Chris was up only five attempts later. I actually missed coaching Alex’s first squat because I was putting Mike’s second attempt in at the table.</p>

<p>Overall I’d grade my coaching as a B, mostly because of what happened during Alex’s deadlift. There was a short break between the bench and deadlift sessions, and after I got the guys warmed up, I stepped out into the crowd to have a mental breather. I got a little distracted by giving information to some people out there (specifically Renee, haha), and as I was walking in in the hallway, I heard the announcer call Alex’s name. I sprinted to the back behind the curtain and caught him as he finished the lift. It wasn’t a big deal because it was actually his last warm-up on the platform (and he obviously smoked it), but I felt terrible. I was apologizing to Alex, and he kept saying, “Hey man, it’s cool. It was easy.” In the midst of all that shit, I forgot to put in his second attempt since I never walked out in front of the curtain. If a minute goes by, they give you an automatic 2.5kg increase on the attempt. Alex’s opener was 207.5/456, and so his official second attempt was 210/462. The rules prevent the coach from making a weight change, so I was feeling like a dumbass.</p>
<p>I figured, “Okay, I’ll just have him take the attempt, pic a weight for the third, and then go in the back and have him hit a second-attempt-weight so he’s prepped for the third.” However that would add an additional warm-up rep. I think it was Mike who said, “Just wave the attempt.” Fucking DUH. We waved the attempt, and I had Alex hit an easy 515 in the warm-up room (thanks to Jeremy, Mel, and Shawn for loading the bar). As for what happened on the third attempt, you’ll have to wait for my write up on Alex. The point is that I kind of fucked up the second attempt, but it ended up not being a big deal.</p>
<p>Other than that, I got the guys warmed up on time and properly, had them ready for their attempts, and made some really good calls on weight jumps. Chris and Alex both had awesome days while Mike’s day was not so good. Overall, the three of them went 23/27 (including Alex’s waved 2nd deadlift) with 6 PR’s. As far as actual cues, I was spot on with Chris (with some help during warm-ups from Mike, who trains with Chris) and Alex, but I regret not having better cues for Mike’s squats (to get a faster descent and more depth) and his deadlift (to finish the lockout), but I’ll save that for their individual write ups. We learned various things during the success and failures, and it will only make us better coaches, programmers, and lifters.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other notable stories associated with this meet, but I wasn’t able to follow them due to the coaching. Reigning 125 National Champion (note that the weight classes were different at this meet) Mike Tuchscherer probably didn’t have as good of a day as he wanted to, but he still squatted 325/715, benched 197.5/434, and deadlifted 355/781 (I believe the squat and deadlift were World Records?). Reigning 100kg National Champion, Matt Nolan (competing in the 105kg class), is probably disappointed that he strained a lat while warming up for deadlift, but he was riding a 250/550 squat and 175/385 bench. I’m pretty sure his second squat was a mis-load. Both guys are USA World Team members after their performance at nationals last August.</p>
<p>Overall, the meet was run very well. I heard of some mis-loads, including the one with Matt Nolan’s squat, but I don’t think it happened often. The judges were all nice folks, and I enjoyed my interaction with the women working the table (again). The announcers were also very good in that they kept everything relevant. They would explain how a particular lift would effect the standings and had good commentary throughout the whole session. The announcers were WAY better than the USAW announcers. Just saying.</p>
<p>We had a great time. I didn’t get a chance to thank the loaders and judges, but their work is appreciated. It takes a lot of work to make a solid meet, and USAPL improves with every big event we attend. I also didn’t get a chance to interview Matt, Mike T., or other friends we’ve made (like Richard Wilcox), but it was good to see everyone and we look forward to seeing them in Texas for nationals.</p>
