  <p>I was at the gym last night and a younger guy stepped into one of the squat racks. <em>This outta be good,</em> I thought. If someone actually does squat in a fitness gym, it’s a half squat done with a back pad. To my pleasant surprise, this guy walked out 135 and squatted it to full depth; I’d rather see light weight squatted fully than heavy weight done partially. After a few minutes, I motioned for him to take out his headphones and said, “Hey man, I just want you to know I appreciate that you squat to full depth.” After a split second of confusion, I added, “Cause nobody ever does.” He nodded in recognition and I walked away. We never talked again.</p>

<p>I hate half squats…<a href="/blog/2010/10/squat-all-of-the-way-down/" target="_blank">so fucking much</a>. <strong>Every time you don’t squat to depth, I pour a beer down the drain. And I HATE wasting beer.</strong> I just don’t understand why people think it’s okay to do partial reps of <em>anything</em>, much less in squatting. Muscular development or strength is achieved by working muscles through a full range of motion. Squatting, benching, or curling through half of the ROM only trains the musculature through that given ROM and typically subjects it to injurious forces. For example, a half squat will not utilize the adductors, hamstrings, gluteals, or external rotators and as a result place excessive stress on the anterior aspect of the knee. This is why ignorant people claim that squats are bad for the knees. And wWhy would someone want half a muscle?</p>
<p>Ego lifting is such a joke. Aside from the “let’s see how many plates I can put on the bar”, it isn’t quantifiable whatsoever. There’s no way to determine if one rep is comparable to another. It drives me insane and I can’t evedslkf;j;lasdkjfaskdlgkad;svn w089yt204389fvay xgch’jbk’fuck</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/e6btCcAmo1g" target="_blank">This is a video</a> of some jackass who thinks there is some kind of utility in half squats (there isn’t).</p>
<p>Here’s a video of an easy full-depth squat (445×3, BW 187ish) by Brooks Conway at <a href="http://quest-athletics.com" target="_blank">Quest Athletics</a>. You could also re-watch <a href="http://youtu.be/uRHA50pJcz8" target="_blank">this vid</a> of Chris raw squatting 600/620/640 for doubles.</p>

<p>Never, ever half squat. If you do we should all just quit lifting and start drinking mermosas while getting pedicures and facials.</p>
