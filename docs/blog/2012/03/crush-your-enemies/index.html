<p>We all know the quote well and good. But do you UNDERSTAND it? Do you GET it?</p>
<p>I DON’T THINK YOU DO.</p>
<p>No, it just doesn’t mean you try to win. No, it just doesn’t mean you try to do your best. You go out there, and you <a href="http://youtu.be/MDaB9wj1rIQ" target="_blank">find that fucking dog</a>!</p>
<p>You aren’t supposed to just have another day, walking in circles. Nay, good sir, you step to the challenge of the day, kick in the door, toss a flash bang, sweep your sectors and put two precision rounds in the brain or heart of that THING, that fucking THING, that stands in the way between you and success.</p>
<p>CHOP YOUR FEET — that fullback is comin’, he’s comin’, he’s gonna meet you in the hole. WHO’S GONNA WIN? YOU OR HIM? WHO’S GONNA GET LOWER? BLOW THAT ISO UP, SON!</p>
<p>Hmm, what I’m trying to say is that when your horse isn’t doing his job because he catches the scent of a mare in heat, you un-sheath your glistening broad sword and <a href="http://youtu.be/kHMT8b1hOdM?t=1m5s" target="_blank">CUT HIS FUCKING HEAD OFF</a>. Wait, no, that doesn’t explain it.</p>
<p>Arnold voice:</p>
<p>There are doubters, naysayers. They say that you shouldn’t break the rules. They say you should be afraid to fail. You can’t always win, but don’t be afraid of making decisions. Believe in yourself to keep pushing. NEVER LISTEN TO “YOU CAN’T”. ONLY LISTEN TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU SAY “YES, YOU CAN.” Muhammad Ali was once asked, “How many sit-ups do you do?” He said, “I don’t count my sit-ups, I only start counting when it starts hurting, because that’s when it really counts. That’s what makes you a champion.” Someone out there is working harder, and someone out there is getting smarter. They are winning. Just remember that. <a href="http://youtu.be/h5fg6DO4ztE?t=2m59s" target="_blank">SLEEP FASTER</a>, I WOULD RECOMMEND, AUUGHHHAUUGHHHH!</p>
<p>What is it that you want to do? What is it that you want to accomplish? What the FUCK is standing in your way? Why are you letting it stop you? The 500 pound squat? The dream job? WHAT EXACTLY IS STOPPING YOU FROM DOING IT? A horde of 10,000 Uruk-Hai, no less. Better to just sit this one out, right? After all, it’s safer. Oh, uh, excuse me sir? Kindly leave. Because WE’RE BUSY SHARPENING OUR SWORDS!</p>
<p>You will have to fight every god. damn. inch. You are all on your own. You will be beaten bloody. You will hang by a thread. But in that moment when you think you are too weak to continue, when you lie in a handful of dust, and when you have all but given up hope…you will rise. You will grit your teeth. You will clench your fists. And you will continue fighting. Because it’s too easy to die.</p>
<p>So, c’mon you apes! You wanna live forever?</p>
