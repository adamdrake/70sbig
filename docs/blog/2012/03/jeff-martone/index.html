  <p>I’ve known of Jeff Martone (owner of <a href="http://tacticalathlete.com/index.php" target="_blank">Tactical Athlete</a>) since I got into CrossFit in early 2008, but I had never met him. After Shankle lifted in the 105 session on Saturday morning, Martone was sitting at his booth by himself and Jeremy and I decided to try the 90 pound pull-up (for a free t-shirt). I, of course, missed it:</p>

</div>

<p>Then I asked Jeff he was going to do any kettlebell juggling, but he only had 90 pound kettlebells (a bit heavy for KB juggling). Then I asked if he was going to do any Turkish Get-ups, and he said he needed a female that weighed 135 or less.</p>
<p>Mission: Find female who was 135 or less.</p>
<p>I went up to an over-cooked-tan blonde girl, and said, “Hi. I realize this isn’t a question a guy would typically ask a girl, but how much do you weigh?” I didn’t get slapped because I’m a little more suave than that, but she was 155. Then I saw a little gal walking with her husband. I politely asked the husband, and after hearing the question he chuckled and said, “Ask her,” while pointing to his wife. Well, we already know that that MISSION WAS ACCOMPLISHED, and here’s the vid (she weighed 110 pounds):</p>
