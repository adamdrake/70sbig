Weekly Reading List
This is stuff that I read this past week that I think you will enjoy.
[spoiler]
John Welbourn weighs in on slow and fast twitch muscle fibers.
Rudy from Outlaw CrossFit talks about his CrossFit programming.
Interesting article by Eric Cressey on how the lats can be too tight and cause problems. It’s not relevant to everyone, but understanding what tight lats do is important. Also, hitting up MobilityWOD.com regularly can alleviate these systems, especially 5 Way Shoulder.
Good post by my homie Dr. Michael Hartman about overtraining and under-recovery (from the Pendlay forum).
Prilepins Chart can help you determine rep ranges in training if you’re unsure what to do.

<p>Sean C. asks,</p>

<p>How do you see accessory (but heavy) exercises like rack bench presses, board presses, etc… fitting into TM?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Sean,</p>
<p>I don’t. The advanced TM stuff evolved for raw powerlifters, and all of them still make progress on the bench without gadgets. I see gadgets helping a) very advanced lifters improve their rate of force development and b) geared lifters. One of the first things a TM user can do to improve his bench is to do it every week instead of alternating it with the press. Benching heavy twice a month is not what improves the bench. Russian lore would say “Bench, and bench some more.” We could even say that Bulgarian lore would say, “Bench, often and heavy.” Assistance lifts can also help improve the bench, like close-grip bench or weighted dips for direct work and barbell rows and weighted pull-ups for indirect work. They also help the “intermediate level lifter” develop his musculature; if the musculature isn’t balanced then that should be addressed before worrying about fancy gadgets.</p>

<p><em>Kel M. asks</em></p>

<p>I was wondering if you could address programming strength training into a sport thats currently “in-season.” Right now, I’m looking at a rugby season that’s just getting into gear, and I don’t want my strength training to compromise my rugby play. In fact, the reason I got into weightlifting was to get bigger so I wouldn’t get tossed around on the pitch. How would you recommend rectifying the conditioning requirements of rugby while maintaining strength while “in season.” I searched the blogs as best I could, so if you answered this already or something similar, I apologize. Thanks for your help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Kel,</p>
<p>It’s a good question. The way we’ll think about approaching it is altering the volume, frequency, and exercise choice. The volume of your lifting may need to drop so that you can spend that much needed recovery on rugby. It’s not that you’ll be so fatigued from rugby that you’ll have trouble lifting, but you’ll probably have aches, pains, and bruises. Lowering the volume will decrease the work you put on your body when it’s already beat up. For example, if you have a thigh or knee bruise, and then you hit high volume squats, you could be squatting on a structure that isn’t 100% and cause a structural failure (strain, tear, etc.).</p>
<p>The frequency should also decrease so that you don’t bog your body down. Obviously you can’t recover from a full training load AND rugby, so something has to give. If you only have x amount of recovery credits and a full training load costs 75 and rugby costs 50, then you’ll have to drop the training off to 50. You’re practicing twice a week with a game once a week. I suggest you use two training days a week; something similar to my <a href="/files/Articles/Lascek_S&#038;CP_v2.0.pdf" target="_blank">S&amp;C Program</a> (older version, will update in near future).</p>
<p>Exercise selection should change so that you aren’t putting too much structural stress on your body. I’m of the opinion that deadlifts are expendable, given your situation. Instead, use power cleans, cleans, and/or RDLs.</p>
<p>The last concept is related to “auto-regulation” or “fucking intuitive” training. If your body is tired, then don’t lift as heavy. If you’re feeling good, and the bar speed is good, then push a bit. If you’re only training twice a week, you won’t necessarily have to worry about doing too much if you stay in intelligent set/rep schemes. Check out Prilepin’s chart (linked at the beginning of the post) and stick to the lower end range, possibly lower, for your in-season training. Keep me and us updated on how it goes.</p>
