Starting Position
Whenever I use the term “rack pull”, I’m referring to one in which the bar starts below the patella (knee cap) and at the upper part of the tibial tuberosity (the bony potrusion on the tibia that is below the patella). Other people may call these “below the knee rack pulls”. This style of rack pull is much harder to do than it’s “above the knee” counter part because it is supposed to remove the quadriceps from pushing the bar up. Instead, it’s aim is to load the hamstrings and force them to extend the hips while the lumbar erectors hold the pelvis in place. I bring your attention to this picture I drew in MS Paint to illustrate this point in a Q&amp;A in January.

Note that the lumbar will help hold the pelvis in a neutral position to allow the hamstrings to stay stretched (left side). If the lumbar fail, then the pelvis will posteriorily tilt and slackens the hamstring (right side).

<p>The “below the knee” starting position puts a much higher demand on the hamstrings and lumbar, and that’s why it’s preferable. It’s likely that the lifter won’t be able to rack pull as much as they deadlift, and it’s often much less with these mechanics. That is okay, because the point is to train hamstrings to extend the hips while under immense tension. If a deadlift lockout is void of hamstring involvement, then the lumbar spine rounds and puts unhappy stress on the vertebrae. Injury potential increases and muscular involvement decreases. A deadlifter will pull more weight if he actually had strong hamstrings and actually used them, and that’s what the deadlift will train.</p>
<p><strong>The Knee Position</strong></p>
<p>A good starting position won’t guarantee a good movement pattern. The primary thing we’re trying to avoid is the knees moving forward under the bar. This knee flexion will reduce the tension on the hamstrings (because the hamstrings cross both the knee and hip joints). It occurs because the hamstrings are unable to handle the tension, and the body shifts to remove that tension. The result is that the bar doesn’t move up, yet the torso becomes more vertical. It almost always rounds the lumbar spine because the hips have to move forward since they are attached to the other end of the femur. The result is that the lifter quad pressed the weight up with a rounded lumbar spine, and then must extend that lumbar spine to finish the lockout. It’s not a good position and significantly increases the chance for injury. Here’s an example:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBFWVm51fQQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This is just a random video I found, and this guy might be very strong, but his hamstrings weren’t adapted to handling large amounts of tension here. He actually has a good starting position (with vertical shins), but you can see his hamstrings shaking (tut-tut-tut) and then the knees shift under the bar. Re-watch it and look at his lower back; it rounds. It’s not terrible, but it’s there. Look at the picture/diagram I drew above; he’s doing what’s on the right side. This won’t be productive for improving the hamstring strength or deadlift lockout.</p>
<p>Here are two videos of Mike and Chris (rack pulls start at 2:33 and :53 respectively)</p>
<p>Mike:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0Mv3-w02iM" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Chris:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vBrrKQTEKis" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>You can’t see their shins, but they are vertical. You can note the care and precision they have in keeping their lumbar in neutral position. Had their lumbar rounded, their hamstrings would shorten and be removed of tension. Both of them do an excellent job of this, but I’m particularly proud of Mike’s diligence because his deadlift lockouts are pretty fugly (he has exceptionally long femurs, and this makes it hard to lock DL’s out; his lumbar is usually pretty round). Chris’ body type (long torso, short femurs) was made to deadlift. Both focus on keeping their hamstrings and lumbar tight. Note that both of them are rack pulling below their known 1RMs (at one point Chris rack pulled <a href="http://youtu.be/evHE2N2Qh5M?t=45s" target="_blank">700×1</a> at one point, but a little over a month later deadlifted 705).</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>If you decide to use rack pulls in your training, take care to use a vertical shin starting position and do not allow your knees to track forward underneath the bar. Remember that with this movement, knee flexion will slacken the hamstrings and reduce tension. The entire point of this exercise is to train the hamstrings to extend the hips while experiencing extremely high amounts of tension so that when they are called to do so in a deadlift lockout (say, on a third attempt), it’s not a big deal.</p>
