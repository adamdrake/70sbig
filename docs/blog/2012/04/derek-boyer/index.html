  <p>I went to the Australian Sport and Fitness Expo this past weekend, and it was glaringly unimpressive. Conventional fitness and nutrition information still maintains precedence, and the culture reflects that. Thankfully, Derek Boyer was present. Derek is a long-time strongman competitor, powerlifter, Guinness World Record holder, and actor. He’s even dabbled in some sumo wrestling and won the 2011 Oceania Open Championship as well as a multi-national powerlifting champion. A few years ago he was on Australian Gladiators, and he’s undefeated in every Australia’s Strongest Man since 1997. He’s qualified for the World’s Strongest man 8 times with his first appearance in <a href="http://youtu.be/j9CkPcGlAKY" target="_blank">1996</a>. Derek is THE strongman authority in Australia.</p>
<p>He put on a demonstration by lifting a V8 engine and carrying it around (see video below). Unfortunately, the weakling Aussie goobers standing around didn’t have an appreciation for this feat.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkv6HuE8dV0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>I chatted with Derek a bit after the demonstration. Recently he hasn’t focused on powerlifting, yet he deadlifted 370kg. However, another Aussie guy (the name escapes me) deadlifted 372.5. Derek has vowed to not only crush this number, but to deadlift 400kg by the end of the year. If I recall correctly, he deadlifted 360 or 365 last week in his second pulling session, and the first session he did 330 or 340 for a triple. Not too shabby, eh?</p>
<p>It was refreshing to chat with Derek in a sea of CrossFit, bodybuilding, and supplements.
