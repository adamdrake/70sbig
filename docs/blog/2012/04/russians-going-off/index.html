  <p>I think Brian checks his YouTube subscription for new weightlifting videos every six minutes because he dropped a video-link-deuce on the fan page this morning before I knew what was going on. Here are videos of various Russian weightlifters that are preparing for the 2012 London Olympic Games (27 July until 12 August). <a href="http://www.london2012.com/games/sport-competition-schedules/olympic-sport-competition-schedule.php?sport=Weightlifting&#038;venue=&#038;date=&#038;Search.x=40&#038;Search.y=15" target="_blank">Here is the weightlifting schedule</a> (we’ll worry more about this later), but note that Klokov is going to lift at 1700 local time on Monday, August 6th, which will be noon in the EST time zone.</p>
<p>Let’s kick it off with the whammy, a 9 minute video of Klokov preparing to lift interspersed with warming up and hitting some numbers. He misses a double at 200 on snatch, and then says “fuck iiiiiiiit” and throws 205 on. After hitting that, Chigishev gives him a golf clap and Klokov is all, “Hey brah, that’s only 5kg over the World Record, SO COOL YOUR JETS.” And Chigishev is like, “lol bro, you cray cray”. I also want to note that the building they walk into in the beginning is exactly what I pictured in the dream I had where I chatted with Klokov on a park bench (in front of the building) with KGB guards posted everywhere.</p>

</div>

<p>Now here is Klokov nonchalantly clean and jerking 232.5.</p>

</div>

<p>Here is Maxim Matveev, who is a younger Russian 105kg lifter, doing a push-press with 185kg. It may not be <a href="http://youtu.be/KtxQFmRlKaY" target="_blank">Klokov’s 225</a>, but it’s still a whole lotta weight. But <a href="http://youtu.be/mDHtCTH_ZaI" target="_blank">Matveev has jerked 250 out of the rack</a>, and that’s admirable, no?</p>

</div>

<p>Then an easy front squat followed by a power jerk…with 210kg? Thank you sir, may I have another.</p>

<p>Russians are stronger than Mike Tyson’s lisp.</p>
