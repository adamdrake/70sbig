PR Friday
You know the drill. Post any PR’s you made, but also post your training updates. If you don’t, WHO WILL EVER REMEMBER YOUR NAME???
Weekly Challenge
Last week’s challenge was to eat vegetables in at least one meal every day. Y u no do dis?
Next Week’s Challenge:
On one day next week, put 25 to 35 pounds in a pack, wear it on your back, and walk for 30 to 60 minutes non-stop. If you have a dog, take them. Do this after training or on a day in which you don’t have any training the next day. It shouldn’t be terribly difficult. As you do it, think about how there are soldiers who are doing the same thing at the same time as you somewhere in the world. Except they are doing it with three to four times as much weight and are probably in a dangerous location or preparing to be in one. Regardless of your country — US, CAN, UK, AUS — they made the choice to do it which allows you to not have to. Doing this will probably act as conditioning, but it’ll give you an appreciation for service members.

Weekly Recap
Monday we took a gander at an inspiring CJ by CC, who is coached by Ben Claridad. Tuesday I reviewed the GoRuck Challenge and explained why I think it’s worth your time. Wednesday Jacob Cloud did a solid-ass recap of the 2012 IPF Raw Worlds. Thursday I posted an excerpt from the first chapter of FIT to provoke some thought on fitness and purposeful training.
I’m in DC with NORTH AMERICAN CHAMPTION Chris Riley, and we’ll be doing some touring on the national mall today. Yesterday we walked around to see the monuments in 98 degree weather, and Chris was rewarded with severe chaffing. He’ll also be deadlifting a lot of weight at the Saturday portion of the seminar this weekend.

<blockquote>
<p><em>Aaron asks via Twitter:</em></p>
<p>hey Justin you massive guy you.. I have all of this happening to me… Any suggestion how to help it?? (<a href="http://youtu.be/JslrFB06wPU" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yo Az,</p>
<p>The video explains how sitting can shorten the hip flexors and a) prevent quality extension during lifting or athletic movements and b) promote a hyper extended position in the lumbar and/or anteriorily rotated hip (which can have debilitating effects when lifting.</p>
<p>For everyone else, Aaron is a bodybuilder down in Oz, so hip function is important to him so that he can a) get the full ROM when training to improve his musculature and strength and b) maintain good posture to prevent injury, and c) maybe avoid a possible weird posture on stage that might make it look like his spinal erectors are less jacked than they are. If Aaron is hyper-extended habitually, it might prevent those spinal erectors from developing fully; this would also have an effect on his overall strength in squatting, deadlifting, rowing, etc.</p>
<p>How can we improve this? The first thing you can do is work on your psoas, and Kelly explains <a href="http://youtu.be/Xcx9P5KFNk8" target="_blank">it well in this video</a>. I would stress that you want to approach the psoas from the lateral portion of your torso (i.e. outside the stomach), because if you just put the ball straight on your belly, you’ll probably just set it on your intestines. You can always double check if it’s your psoas by palpating deep into the area with your fingers while laying on your back. Flex your hip (by lifting your thigh), if you feel a contraction, then that is the psoas. Put the ball there. If it doesn’t contract, then keep hunting.</p>
<p>You’d also want to regularly open up the rest of the hip flexors; the quadriceps, and particularly the rectus femoris, will get tight from sitting down. There will be also some other muscles stretched like the TFL and sartorius on the later side, and some of the anterior adductor fibers on the medial side. If you have a band, you can open up that proximal (upper) hip with some anterior distraction, like in <a href="http://youtu.be/SPpAECK8jFs?t=5m39s" target="_blank">this video</a>. Keep watching and you’ll see the “couch stretch” that I do against the door. If you’re so tight that you can barely get in first position (like I think you are), then just hang out there. Shari will give you some more thoughts on this stretch, I’m sure (they’ll probably include profanity).</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2012/06/this-is-why-we-do-it/#comment-25734" target="_blank">jcfendley asks:</a></em></p>
<p>WOW. Incredible mentality to not quit.</p>
<p>Just a quick question. I’m in the car traveling this weekend, so I’ve done zero searching on this topic. I’ve been talking to my brother in law about how to best prep my nephew for his first year of junior high football. He’s 13 and pretty big for his age, but not terribly strong. Since he’s so big hes not very quick, but he can build some speed if given time.</p>
<p>Honestly Ive never played, so I know zilch about the skill related prep. But I really feel like I need to give him a decent strength and knowledge base as a buffer to injury and bad habits. I really feel like I’m capable of getting him to a good place and providing enough good guidance to keep him progressing.</p>
<p>I’d like to start him out for a while with just body weight movements, help him get some spatial awareness, an understanding of mechanics, and his ability. Then move into a slow LP. Then probably into something like CFFB over the longer term. Just have to get into it and find out what he’ll stick to.</p>
<p>What advice do you guys have?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What resources should I look to for programming at his age / ability level?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When / where should I look at starting the oly lifts with him?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Too long. Sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear jcfendley,</p>
<p>These issues are typically dependent on how far into puberty the kid is. However, strength is still the fundamental capacity. Even if you had a background in football and could teach him skill dependent things, he would still get a better return on his time/effort investment if he focused on strength training. That body weight and spatial awareness stuff you wanted to work on could be used as a warm-up for his squatting, pressing, or benching. You can have him deadlift too, but don’t let him do it shitty. I’d rather see quality RDLs than B- grade deadlifts.</p>
<p>As for Oly lifts, you probably have a lot more simpler stuff to worry about. Can he even squat properly to depth with his knees shoved out? Can he do back extensions and RDL’s properly? Again, it all depends on his puberty development. I’ve had a 12 year old kid who was 6′, 200 pounds while another 12 year old was 5’3 and 90 pounds. It just depends. If you want him to do explosive work, just have him do tuck jumps, squat jumps, or broad jumps. You could have him do some short sprints as well. Another effective thing is to have him laterally shuffle back and forth, then give him a randomly timed signal to sprint forward. This would be my extent of his “agility” or “football” drills, because, again, increasing his strength is going to augment all of his other physical attributes. The football coaches will condition him for football.</p>

<p>Why would a strength and conditioning coach not program deadlifts?</p>
<p>The reason I ask:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So I was working today and happened to walk into the strength facility for a Colorado high school( a big one) with an epic almost Olympic like feel. Turns out it was designed with the help of the good folks down at the Olympic training facility. So I struck up a conversation with the strength and conditioning coach who had built the facility to his specifications(fucking amazing place to his credit) and we were talking lifting and he just kinda casually dismissed deadlifts because in his opinion the slow motion of a deadlift didn’t compute to strong, quick, powerful athletes. I told him I disagreed but I didn’t delve to deep. I’m just confused how a guy with the obvious mindset of having strong athletes can dismiss the deadlift? Does that kind of mindset happen often? Extra questions I know but they go with the overall question.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Dear Gilbert,</p>
<p>It’s pretty common, especially in high school athletics. For example, I never deadlifted in high school and only did them heavy a few times before I moved to Texas. We did do power cleans and RDLs, though.</p>
<p>The reasoning is that the deadlift, being a slow and straining type of movement, is perceived at making an athlete slow. This ignores that the deadlift can improve structural integrity of the lumbar and hips, something that will help make young kids faster, more agile, and helps prevent injury. However, I’d more so be concerned with the deadlift’s effect on recovery. For football players, heavy deadlifts are going to cause a lot of local and systemic stress and probably have an effect on football practice or other weight training and sprint sessions during the week. My guess is that the “effect on recovery” isn’t one of the reasons they avoid the deadlift, but it should be. There are many types of programs that I write or approve of that don’t include deadlifts on purpose. Some populations include, but are not limited to in season athletes, soldiers/SOF, and hikers. It just depends on what they need to do and how they are going to use the deadlift (they could be used light, but the deadlift is almost always an ego lift).</p>
<p>Back extensions and RDL’s aren’t a perfect substitute for the deadlift, but they can still get good muscle action on the structures. The power cleans will emulate a pull and develop power, which is important for hitting people in football.</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2012/06/go-ruck-challenge-review/#comment-25773" target="_blank">cfitz asks:</a></em></p>
<p>Any thoughts on wearing vibrams for this (the <a href="https://www.goruckchallenge.com/" target="_blank">GoRuck Challenge</a>)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear cfitz,</p>
<p>Wearing vibrams for a GoRuck would be an excellent way to fuck your feet, ankles, and lower leg up. I figured this was a troll question, but I wanted to address vibrams…<a href="/blog/2011/03/what-not-to-do/" target="_blank">again</a>.</p>
<p>I fucking hate when people lift in vibrams. It’s inefficient (i.e. bad mechanics), and efficiency is the same thing as safety in lifting. It’s one thing to do your “functional fitness” portion of your workout in them (though I would still recommend against it), but it’s another to wear them all the time in the gym. Besides, wearing vibrams isn’t something that is going to strengthen your feet properly; <strong>proper foot mechanics when barefoot is what will strengthen your feet properly</strong> . Most people have externally rotated hips that result in their toes pointing out. Most people have navicular drop, which is a collapsed arch (that results in a totally FUCKED ankle joint). Most people walk around slapping their feet like ducks instead of transitioning from heel to toe evenly across their feet. This has a direct effect on efficacy in athletic movements, preventing injury in any movement (from running to rucking), and lifting. If you realize that you have crappy feet or mechanics, then it will require mobility and strengthening exercises (see post <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-awareness/" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-drills/" target="_blank">two</a> for more on this). It won’t improve over night, and it certainly won’t improve by continuing to move shitty with vibrams on due to simply being “barefoot”.</p>
<p>I’m fine with people wearing vibrams outside; they help protect the soles of the feet for soft-skinned folks. They are effective on the beach, in rocky streams, and during kayaking. First, learn what good mechanics are. Second, start implementing the good mechanics in movement. Third, work on your feet with proper mobility and strengthening. Lastly, get outside in your bare feet and practice good mechanics. It’s all irrelevant if you’re repetitively using shitty mechanics.</p>
<p>And to bring this back to the topic of rucking, only a fool would ruck in vibrams. I would expect significant strains int he tendons, ligaments, and fascia of the foot, ankle, and shins. Shoes have a purpose, people. They protect our feet from extraneous forces.</p>
