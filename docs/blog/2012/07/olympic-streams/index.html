  Go to All Things Gym and look at his nice, organized stream list. I’m shocked at how organized this dude is; he’s on the internet a lot. In any case, he has a long list of various free streams you can use. Thanks, Gregor.

  <p>For fuck’s sake, you guys are blowing me up constantly for weightlifting streams. You can do one of several things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to All Things Gym and look at his <a href="http://www.allthingsgym.com/2012/07/how-to-watch-the-olympics-online/" target="_blank">nice, organized stream list</a>. I’m shocked at how organized this dude is; he’s on the internet a lot. In any case, he has a long list of various free streams you can use. Thanks, Gregor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch it on your home country’s network, assuming you have their cable package. I can tell you that Comcast blows and is difficult to deal with, so let’s go to the next option…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TUNNEL BEAR, ASSEMBLE! TunnelBear.com has a VPN for download, and it’s a cheaper option than other programs I’ve seen online. I don’t know what “VPN” is, and I don’t care. What it does is it makes your location appear from somewhere else. This is legal, and it can help protect you. In this case, we are using it to “tunnel” our position into the UK so that we can use the BBC live streams (they also have session recaps to re-watch any event). <a href="http://www.tunnelbear.com/help/" target="_blank">Read the FAQ</a> if you’re confused.</p>

    Bears are always funny. Tunnel Bears are always helpful.

<p>Download the program for free, and you’ll get 500mb of data each month (Note: <a href="http://www.tunnelbear.com/twitter-promo/" target="_blank">If you tweet at TunnelBear</a>, they’ll give you 1gb for free within a day or so). <strong>Unlimited data is only $4.99/month</strong>, which is half the price of other options out there. To me it’s worth watching the lifting sessions, but I also get to stream all of the Olympic events live or re-watch all the events. I don’t get anything from Tunnel Bear, but I love bears and I love weightlifting.</p>
<p>Tunnel Bear is very simple. Download it. Install it. Sign up (free or paid). Install the network thingy (it’ll do it for you). Open program. Sign in. Flip the right switch to “UK”, flip the left switch to “On”. Wait a sec, and the gadget screen will turn blue. You’re good. Then go to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video" target="_blank">BBC stream site</a>. Load whatever you want to watch. The player will load and have a little “i&gt;” on the left. Click that to play. If you have issues with the stream, then reload. Be patient at first.</p>
<p>Personally, my stream is a bit choppy. When it plays, it’s very good quality, but it’ll pause once a minute for a few seconds and then keep going. This is due to my shitty internet connection at the house, so your results will vary. If you are worried about the expense, then try the free 500mb option before paying.</p>
<p>Thank you to <s>@</s>culfinglin for the tip on Tunnel Bear! _Edit: There’s no malware or adware in Tunnel Bear. _</p>
