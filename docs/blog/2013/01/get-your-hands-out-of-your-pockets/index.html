  <p>There are several different things that I’ve responded to this morning that result in today’s post. They all collide into a common theme: people who are unwilling to do what they need to do to be successful.</p>
<p>This is a timely post on 70’s Big. In December I made the point that waiting for the <a href="/blog/2012/12/new-years-resolution/" target="_blank">New Year</a> to start a new habit was stupid; “If something is important to you, do it right. fucking. now.” Then I asked everyone to <a href="/blog/2013/01/letter-of-intent-2013-pr-friday/" target="_blank">commit to a competition</a> and explained <a href="/blog/2013/01/the-next-step/" target="_blank">what to do after committing</a>. This is the time of year when gyms swell and nutrition challenges are everywhere.</p>
<p>Yet everyone looks for a short cut. And it drives me fucking insane.</p>
<p>I’m currently reading Arnold Schwarzenegger’s autobiography. I’ve read his previous biography and have always been a fan of his drive and determination. But reading this recent, more in depth life account shows two things: 1) Arnold always did everything he could to achieve his goals, and 2) None of us are anywhere near that level of commitment (including me). Even in the first decade of his acting career he was buying and selling real estate, running his mail order business, and traveled the world to promote every movie he made. He is the epitome of undying motivation.</p>

<p>While Arnold fights to succeed, all of us accept laziness and sloth. When Arnold heard businessmen talking about how hard they worked for 10 or 12 hours, he’d say (and this is a direct quote from the book), “What the fuck are you talking about, when they day has twenty-four hours? What else did you do?”</p>
<p>Right now there are paleo challengers who want to know if they can use artificial sweeteners, there are veteran lifters going to bed late, and there are sedentary people considering exercising but not actually doing it.</p>
<p>These are the same people — some of you, even — that look at someone successful and think, “They are a genetic freak,” or “I wish I could have as much money as them.” And that is such bullshit. I’ve gone on this rant before, but all my life I’ve been accused of using steroids or just having superior genetics, but I’m the one who has squatted every week with hardly any breaks for 12+ years. I’m the one who made the decision to stop drinking soda <em>at 13 years old</em>. I’m the one who felt like shit, but woke my ass up at 7 in the morning or walked into the garage at 10 at night to train. And I’m not even anywhere _near _Arnold’s motivation!</p>
<p>Write your goals down. What do you want to do? What do you want to be? What do you want to have or know? <a href="http://youtu.be/vH0nP4NzS9M" target="_blank"><em>WHO</em> do you want to be?</a> Do you think squatting 405 is a big deal? Then do it — because <a href="/blog/2012/06/every-man-can-squat-405/" target="_blank">I believe every man can squat 405</a>. Do you want to drop your body fat below 15%? Then do it. Anyone can accomplish these basic training tasks. But they are harder than being a slack-jaw piece of shit, they are harder than deciding to eat the candy, and they’re harder than being content with a sub 350 squat.</p>
<p>In last weekend’s seminar I made a reoccurring joke about “the naysayers”, something Arnold has talked about in various speeches. These are the people that think your dreams aren’t possible, that they are too lofty. The naysayers aren’t always out there in the world talking you down. In reality, the naysayer is you.</p>
<p>For gods’ sake, when you have that moment of weakness in managing your time, going to bed, eating the junk food, or going easy in training, have the courage to tell the naysayer —  yourself — to go fuck himself. When you’re done telling yourself to go fuck yourself, <a href="http://youtu.be/EL8e2ujXe8g" target="_blank">stop whining</a>, stand up, and start productively working towards your goals. I leave you with a quote from Arnold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you’re out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same time is working hahd. Someone is getting smarter and someone is winning, just remember that.</p>
<p>“You can’t climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.”</p>
<p>— Arnold Schwarzenegger</p>
</blockquote>
