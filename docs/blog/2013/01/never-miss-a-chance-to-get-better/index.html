  <p>70’s Big started as a joke six months before the site launched in September of 2009. After coining the phrase, our group of friends saw 70’s Big in everything we did. Eating a one pound burger was 70’s Big. Getting eight hours of sleep was 70’s Big. Air guitaring was 70’s Big. Anything that pushed us towards the goal of being stronger and bigger was 70’s Big.</p>
<p>The attitude of 70’s Big has been in my life for almost four years, but the mentality has been around longer. Shouting the phrase, “Never miss a chance to get better!” and following it with impromptu exercise was one of my favorite public jokes. See two chairs together? Get a few dips in. See a sidewalk? Get some walking lunges. Never miss a chance to get better.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember shouting the phrase outside a bar on Halloween in 2008 when AC and I dressed up as speed walkers. I drunkenly shouted the phrase, jumped on an awning, and started doing pull-ups. When I landed, I looked down to see blood seeping out of a gash on my hand. “Never missing a chance” has its consequences, but this didn’t stop me from speed walking up and down the bar or doing jumping jacks in the corner.</p>

<p>This “joke” is a derivative of a long-time belief I established at an early age: people should not only never plateau in life, but they should never be satisfied with plateauing. The very idea should make them vomit.</p>
<p>Some people hang their hat on past accomplishments as if it gives them the right to complacency. **“Success” is not something that a person ever qualifies for, but a state of mind that results from honestly striving for it. **</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t think anything I’ve done is impressive. Graduating college, coaching people, or establishing this website — to me these are byproducts of the work I’ve put in. I don’t ever focus on what I’ve achieved, but focus on what I could have done better. And there’s a <em>lot</em> that I could have done better. I don’t dwell or fester on the  bad, but use it as a tool to improve. Just like in lifting, <a href="/blog/2010/08/learn-from-your-mistakes/" target="_blank">if something goes wrong</a>, figure out why, and then work towards rectifying the problem. Everyone has good traits that clash with flaws, yet it’s overcoming the flaws that allow us to show our quality while working towards success.</p>
<p>My intention with this website has always been to educate and subsequently motivate. If that means I have to act like a fuck-head to get your attention, then that’s something I’m willing to do. If you get nothing else from 70’s Big, I hope it’s the motivation to bust your ass in training, but it’s my sincerest hope that this rubs off into the rest of your life. Attack your life goals with the same intensity you use during a 3RM squat attempt. <a href="/blog/2013/01/mental-workout-pr-friday-25-jan-2013/" target="_blank">Train your mind</a>, speak foreign languages, study history, understand philosophy, play musical instruments — independently _think _and actively learn to better yourself. It’s no different than training your body and equally important.</p>
<p>Above all…<em>never</em> miss a chance to get better.</p>
