<p><span style="color: #000000">To anyone remotely familiar with strength training, it is quite obvious that the posterior chain plays an important role in the sport of weightlifting. However, developing strength in the hamstrings, glutes, and back for improving performance in the snatch and clean &amp; jerk isn’t quite as simple as it may seem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I break the movements I use for this purpose down into two groups. This article discusses the first of those groups, the general: These movements are designed to create strength throughout the posterior chain in a way which is not specific to the snatch and clean &amp; jerk. You are probably at least familiar with most of these movements.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">1. Romanian Deadlift</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If you are a consistent reader of 70’s Big, it is pretty unlikely that you haven’t heard plenty about the RDL. I’ll keep it simple here: we train it once a week, usually for 3×5, occasionally building up to a top set of 5 with good form before resetting.  For mechanics, I’ll refer to you Justin’s<a title="RDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDL" href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/"> post on the topic</a>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">2. Pendlay Row</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Basically a strict barbell row. The man himself tells you how to do it in the video below.</span><span style="color: #000000"> We usually do these for heavy sets of 3-5 across, occasionally doubles or singles. In a lighter training phase, or for a lifter who needs some hypertrophy, we’ll do sets up to 10-12 reps.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlRrIsoDpKg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">3. Glute Ham Raise</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I like sets of 5-10 on these. If 10 reps is easy, add some weight. Use with great care; these will make you sore for days. Once a week is plenty, and start with a low dose, like 3×5 (if you can do them at all…a lot of very strong people can’t.)</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9zKJw1KmbA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><em>(I had Tsypkin create a GHR video because 90% of the GHR’s I see out there in the cold dark world are turrible. Just turrible. He got Ariel to be his lovely assistant. You’re welcome. – Cloud)</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">4. Back Extension</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This is a true back extension, as taught here by some strange non-bearded Pendlay impersonator.</span><span style="color: #000000"> Typically I start a lifter with 3×10-15 at bodyweight, and increase the reps up to 20 over a week or two, then add load at 3×10.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdmI5Ex8HMw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">5. Back Raise</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This is what most people refer to as a back extension. In reality the hips and hamstrings are doing the work here, but it’s still a very useful exercise. I follow the same protocol for applying these to a lifter’s training as I do for the back extensions, and Glenn covers this in the back extension video. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the next segment, we will discuss posterior chain exercises specific to the sport of weightlifting.</span></p>
