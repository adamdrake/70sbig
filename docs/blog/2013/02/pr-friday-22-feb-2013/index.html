We started off the week strong, with a write-up on Ryan Carrillo, his quest to compete at the IPF Bench Press World Championships, and a quick interview .

  <p>It’s PR Friday! The new phone book’s here!</p>
<p>We started off the week strong, <a title="Click here to reveal Ninja secrets!" href="/blog/2013/02/ryan-carrillo-is-70sbig/" target="_blank">with a write-up on Ryan Carrillo</a>, his quest to compete at the IPF Bench Press World Championships, and a quick interview <a href="/blog/2013/02/pr-friday-22-feb-2013/ryanrib/" rel="attachment wp-att-8594"><img data-attachment-id="8594" data-permalink="/blog/2013/02/pr-friday-22-feb-2013/ryanrib/" data-orig-file="/2013/02/ryanrib.jpg" data-orig-size="720,960" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ryan rib" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2013/02/ryanrib-150x200.jpg" data-large-file="/2013/02/ryanrib-450x600.jpg" class="alignright  wp-image-8594" src="/2013/02/ryanrib-450x600.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="324" srcset="/2013/02/ryanrib-450x600.jpg 450w, /2013/02/ryanrib-112x150.jpg 112w, /2013/02/ryanrib-150x200.jpg 150w, /2013/02/ryanrib-225x300.jpg 225w, /2013/02/ryanrib.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /></a>.</p>
<p>For those that have donated, may Crom grant you many bench PRs. You are good people. Ryan is sincerely thankful to everyone who donated. He got about 150 doll hairs from our readers on Monday, but I think we can improve on that. Go to <a href="http://www.txstrongman.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.txstrongman.com/">http://www.txstrongman.com/</a></a> and donate your face off. For best results, do it about 30 minutes before your scheduled intensity day training.</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of Ryan eating a Brontosaurus rib. Yes, this is how we do it in Texas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Justin dropped us a <a href="/blog/2013/02/a-quick-note/" target="_blank">quick note</a> on Tuesday to let us know he’s still around, just busy stacking paper. Lots of good, positive comments by all, which he appreciated. I’ll be taking over the Editor duties, though I’m not as funny or ripped as Justin, just more ridiculously-good-looking, and I like run-on sentences. Any non-grammar feedback is appreciated, so you can always hit me up via <a href="mailto:cloud@70sbig.com?subject=heyyyyyyy" target="_blank">email</a>, mmmk? I’ll respond when I’m not doing curls. Many thanks to BSmith for helping me out with all the behind-the-scenes work…and for making this killer .gif.</p>

<p>We also had a follow-up by Tsypkin on <a href="/blog/2013/02/posterior-round-up-part-2" target="_blank">posterior training</a>, specifically for weightlifters, complete with how-to videos featuring his lovely assistant. Some guy named Pendlay commented a couple times. How many other sites have world-class coaches giving you free advice in the comments? That’s a rhetorical question; I don’t read other sites. We did get the comment of the week, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who the hell is this GlenPendlay guy and where did he come from? Can’t believe someone here named themselves after a kind of row… – ow3n</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ow3n wins 12 points.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we are <strong>ONE WEEK FROM THE ARNOLD</strong>. This is the biggest sports festival in the entire freaking universe, and a bunch of our folks are competing, so pay attention. We’ll get you previews and links to streams and whatnot next week.</p>
<p>Mike’s training has gone well and he’s looking to hit some big numbers. Subscribe to his Youtube channel, read his <a href="/mike/" target="_blank">training log</a>, and watch this video about what he does in the final week before a big meet.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ja4HwcTN-i4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><a href="/chris/" target="_blank">Big Chris</a> will be defending his North American Championship from last year’s Arnold. How does he prepare? He drinks chicken. He. Drinks. Chicken. If you don’t pull 700+ double-overhand, and/or can’t spell “K-A-L-E,” watch this video, and get to work. cya</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQq9y8sAFP4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>List your PRs and which event you’re most excited to watch at the Arnold. Personally, I hit some modest bench PRs and got a brutal PSOA-release massage (<a href="/blog/2012/08/finding-the-psoas/">DIY Guide</a> for you sickos), and I have to give a shout-out to my special lady friend, who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0GXFTP0jrw" target="_blank">pulled 280</a>. I’ll be watching the Arnold streams while at a Bachelor party next weekend. Whatcha got?</p>
