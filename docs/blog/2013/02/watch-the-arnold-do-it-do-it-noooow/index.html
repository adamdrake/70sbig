  <p><em>Note: This week’s posting schedule for the site got a little thrown off because I took the opportunity to interview <a href="/blog/2013/02/meet-the-man-who-squats-905-raw/" target="_blank">Ray Williams</a> and decided to post it immediately. It turns out that it was pretty popular. We had almost exactly twice as many hits in a day as the next best post in the history of the site (“<a title="You should probably click this. It's fun. " href="/blog/2012/07/sexy-isnt-always-better/" target="_blank">Sexy Isn’t Always Better</a>” which has, go figure, pics of hot chicks bending over). Gregor, of <a title="This site is awesome. Follow them on facebook. " href="http://www.allthingsgym.com/" target="_blank">All Things Gym</a> fame, shared the post on Reddit, and we had a few dozen forums also link back to the story. In fact, a couple Redditors were so impressed by the story that a new bar and several 100lb plates are on their way to Ray’s gym, so that he can start working that linear progression to like, a million, give or take. <golf clap></em></p>
<p><strong>BUT NOW IT’S TIME TO GET BACK TO THE ARNOLD!</strong></p>
<p>Going forward, Thursdays will be a Q&amp;A with our very own Tsypkin. In fact, he sent me a post for today before he got on a plane for Columbus (not to be confused with Cleveland), OH, because he is a very nice person, and thorough. Instead, I’m going to risk his wrath and wait until next week to post his very excellent advice. Why? <strong>BECAUSE ARNOLD, THAT’S WHY!</strong></p>

<p>We have a bunch of our very own lifting this Friday in an international contest of raw strength. That’s kind of a big deal. For the full line-up of lifters involved in Friday’s USAPL/NAPF raw meet (all of which takes place on Friday), <a href="http://arnold.usapowerlifting.com/2013/02/2013ArnoldSportsFestival.FlightBreakdown.pdf" target="_blank">GO HERE</a>.</p>
<p>For the times that each flight is lifting, <a href="http://arnold.usapowerlifting.com/2013/02/2013USAPLArnoldSportsFestival.ScheduleOnly.pdf" target="_blank">GO HERE</a>.</p>

<p>There will also be weightlifting at the Arnold, sanctioned by the USAW, and it will serve as the qualifier for the Pan-Am games.</p>
<p>You can read more about it <a href="http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/home/sports-and-events/weightlifting.html" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>The Start List is <a href="http://www.columbusweightlifting.org/pdfarnold/Start_List_Feb_25.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>. This includes flights, weight classes, coaches, times, etc.</p>

<p>*\<em>* I currently do not have a live stream link for weightlifting at the Arnold. I will update this if someone can send me one. Thanks. **</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stay tuned,and I shall provide more links and updates.</p>
