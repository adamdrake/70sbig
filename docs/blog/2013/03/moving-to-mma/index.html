<p>—</p>
<p>A very wise man once stated to me that I “just needed to do it, not to talk about doing it,</p>
<p>but just f***ing do it.”</p>
<p>If that doesn’t speak to you about how to live life then I don’t know what does.</p>
<p>My post meathead/football career exported me to a financial firm where days consisted</p>
<p>of shares settling, leveraging foreign currency, and Far East markets. I gained 40lbs and</p>
<p>hated myself.</p>
<p>One year later I quit, went back into training, and started Office to Octagon Inc. on an</p>
<p>ideal with little to no direction.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF2374pB-u8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within three months I started Olympic lifting as a director at InnerCity Weightlifting</p>
<p>where I was fortunate enough to work with nationally ranked lifters and at risk youth in</p>
<p>Boston.</p>
<p>By chance I was training someone who would later become a mentor figure. He served</p>
<p>as high-level management at a Fortune 100 and to this day eats, breaths, and sleeps</p>
<p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>He introduced me to Kimura BJJ and by my third practice I was addicted and under</p>
<p>the instruction of Michael Fontes placed first or second in my first four competitions.</p>
<p>Everything in my training world was flipped upside down.</p>
<p>The whole concept of my strength training being compromised by overwhelming</p>
<p>amounts of aerobic activity was shattered. If anything, most of my lifts improved. In each</p>
<p>practice live fights take place, mostly towards the end after hundreds of repetitions of</p>
<p>particular techniques and positions. Fights range from 2-10 minutes and are balls to the</p>
<p>wall. The more I fought the stronger I became both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>In my first four months I went from 285 to 240, increased my strength, and grew a sweet</p>
<p>ass mustache. Friends of mine in the strength and conditioning world started to reach out</p>
<p>and ask questions about my training.</p>
<p>These are some of the evolving conclusions that I continue to work on.</p>
<p>Time under tension will increase aerobic and anaerobic capacity. I found this to be true</p>
<p>as a young lad moving furniture and interning/lifting at an athletic facility. After 8 to 12</p>
<p>hours of lugging heavy awkward objects up and down stairs, I would still be able to make</p>
<p>gains in the gym relative to copious amounts of time under tension and food.</p>
<p>So was the case with BJJ. I started to mimic fight rounds in my lifting programs by</p>
<p>picking a series of movements and performing a set number of reps, or over the course of predetermined time (Tabata). It was reminiscent of CrossFit but in a way safer, more</p>
<p>structured, and more specific to my sport. As I am sure the 70’s Big community knows,</p>
<p>specificity is key.</p>
<p>Placing emphasis on grip training in moving, training, and BJJ has and will continue</p>
<p>to pay dividends on all of my lifts and I highly encourage anyone and everyone to</p>
<p>incorporate grip work into all of their programming. If you can’t grip it, you can’t lift it.</p>
<p>Now back to how all of this began. Office to Octagon Inc. started out as my journey into</p>
<p>MMA via strength and conditioning and BJJ. Two years later my first amateur fight is set</p>
<p>for June 22nd.</p>
<p>The kicker is that I am putting the event together through OtoO and 20 other Boston</p>
<p>business types will also be competing, all while raising money for charity in the process.</p>
<p>Office to Octagon Inc. is now a 501(c)3 non-profit organization structured to allocate</p>
<p>funds to underprivileged youth obesity prevention initiatives, youth athletics, and youth</p>
<p>nutritional education services.</p>
<p>The art forms that make up MMA have all stood the test of time i.e. boxing, BJJ, Muay</p>
<p>Thai, wrestling, all the very things that we should be investing in and promoting to our</p>
<p>youth. They all embrace respect, discipline, adversity, and focus, exactly what the kids of</p>
<p>this country so desperately need.</p>
<p>In a time where the generations behind us now have a shorter life expectancy,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.designedtomove.org">www.designedtomove.org</a>, it is our duty to fight these odds literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>If you want to make positive changes and/or be good at anything you “just have to</p>
<p>f***ing do it”.</p>
