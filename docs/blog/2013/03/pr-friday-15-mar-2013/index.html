  <p>This week in 70sBigVille, we discussed how, like it or not, CrossFit is impacting the strength world in big ways. Not only are there a million more ladies wearing Lulu tights, <a title="Click here, get gainz" href="/blog/2013/03/some-truths-about-crossfit-and-weightlifting/" target="_blank">there’s also a huge spike in the interest of weightlifting as a sport</a>. Tsypkin wrote up a good post, then trolled a bit imo, and a good time was had by all. Or most, at least. Maybe. Continue arguing below if you think that’s a productive use of your time (vs. more curls).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mike B wrote up an <a title="Click here if you want to live" href="/blog/2013/03/interview-with-mike-jenkins/" target="_blank">interview with Mike Jenkins</a>, large human and competitive Strongman. Strongman as a sport represents a lot of what 70sBig is all about – moving around heavy things and having fun doing it. Mention your latest feats of strength in the comments. I’ll be at a SM contest in San Antonio tomorrow cheering on some brothers. If you know of any events in the near future, mention those, too, and I’ll award you multiple bonus points. These interviews are getting a good reception, so I hope you’re ready for next week – Tsypkin scored a discussion with <a title="Niko is Awesome" href="http://www.garageinkpowerteam.com/Garage-Ink-Lifters.html" target="_blank">Niko</a>. Boom.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, we had a 2-part series of Articles by Bert and Marijke (<a title="Part 1" href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-one/" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, <a title="Part 2" href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-two/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>). Bert was kind enough to send me an update, because they’ve both competed again since then. How many times have you competed this year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Jacob, Thought I’d keep you informed.</p>
<p>Last Saturday Marijke and I competed again and she did 72,5 (2,5KG PR) – 35 (matched previous meet PR) – 80 (10 kg PR).</p>
<p>Right after the first Platform was done, a judge DEMANDED that she tried extra-wide sumo and she pulled 90kgs x 2 (so a 20 kg deadlift PR in a month!)</p>
<p>Here’s the compilation of our lifts. Her training changed slightly and she also lost 2 kilograms between last contest (2nd of February) and this one (2nd of March), weighing 53,3kgs last Saturday.</p>
<p>Kind regards and lots of courage for your lady friend and her training as well!</p>

<p>THIS.IS.AWESOME! I love this stuff. Guys and gals, please keep sending me updates like this. I love it. Also, if anyone wants to come yell at me in foreign languages, I’m pretty sure it’ll add 50 pounds to my total. Thanks ahead of time.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet, check out the forums at <a title="#WINNING" href="http://liftheavyshit.com/forum/" target="_blank">LiftHeavyShit.com</a>. I started it with a buddy of mine after a long night of drinking (and some lifting) and it has evolved into a not-terrible place to keep your log and/or stalk Patrick Stroup’s every lift/meal/BM. We have competitive CrossFitters, Strongmen, PLers, and weightlifters from all around the world keeping their logs and there and posting mirror pics after bench/chins supersets, and not a whole lot of shits are given, nor jimmies russled. Enjoy.</p>
