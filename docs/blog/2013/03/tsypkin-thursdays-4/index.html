<p><strong>David C asks, “If you were going to hire/follow one of the bigger CrossFit coaches out there to help you prepare for the Open, Regionals, and Games, who would you choose?”</strong></p>
<p>Rudy Nielsen of Outlaw.  In part because he has a deep and sound understanding of how to program effectively – but there are a lot of people with that. What Rudy has that a lot of others lack, is a deep and sound understanding of how CrossFit – the SPORT, not the fitness program – functions. He doesn’t debate silly shit like “is CrossFit too strength biased” or “has too much cardio” or whether the “definition of fitness” is legit.  He observes the parameters of the sport, and trains people to compete in them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Dave F asks, “I am training the Olympic lifts three times a week, one day being committed to the snatch, one day to the clean &amp; jerk, and one to both. What is a good rep scheme for a novice?”</strong></p>
<p>First: if you are a novice, I do NOT think that 2x/week per lift is enough. You need to be doing them 3x/week so that you can learn the patterns and learn them well.</p>
<p>About rep schemes…don’t worry about them. Focus on sets of 1-3, get a lot of good reps in, and when you feel great, go for a new PR, whether it be a single, double, or triple. If you’re training alone, don’t do so much that you are exhausted for the last third of your session and do nothing but shitty reps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vee G asks “I was trained using the ‘scoop method’ ala Coach Burgener.  A lot of my fellow weightlifters have been taught in a style more similar to Coach Pendlay’s, which does not teach the scoop. What are some advantages/disadvantages of either technique?”</strong></p>
<p>I’m assuming that by the “scoop method,” you mean teaching an intentional rebending of the knees – sometimes referred to as the double knee bend – under the bar before the second pull.</p>

  <p id="caption-attachment-8926" class="wp-caption-text">
    Did someone say scoop method?
  </p>
</div>
<p>I personally do not teach the scoop/double knee bend as such. I teach the lifter to move into the correct position, and the knees move into the right spot – slightly in front of the bar – just before the lifter extends into the finish. It is my opinion that teaching the intentional double knee bend only serves to confuse new lifters, slow down the transition, and lead to the lifter pushing the bar forward and shifting the weight onto the front of the feet too early.</p>
<p>Although there are certainly good coaches who have made this method work, I cannot see any advantages this way of teaching has over those which do not coach the lifter to intentionally perform the double knee bend.</p>
<p>_Editors’s Note: Please remember to ask Tsypkin anything your crazy little heart desires on our <a title="it's facebook, silly" href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">facebook</a> page. Otherwise, he’s going to have to come up with his own questions to answer, and that would just be crazy. _</p>
