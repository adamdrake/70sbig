  <p>Hope you had a great week. It was pretty quiet on the site, but hopefully you caught Justin’s <a href="/blog/2013/05/memorial-day-2013/">Memorial Day post</a>. Probably best to go re-read it anyway. Since there weren’t very many posts, that gave you less time to read, and more time to lift. Make sure you post your PRs that resulted. There seems to be quite a few people competing this weekend (myself included), so everyone, please: Seek and Destroy.</p>
<p>Mike didn’t have enough Q to make a Q&amp;A this week, but he weighed in on something I personally think is really important. Watch, listen, and see if you agree.</p>

<p>Entertaining stuff has been sent in. Here’s some of it.</p>
<p>Brooks Conway’s buddy John Rivas squatted 793 at IPF Jr. Worlds last year, and has finally shared his secret with us mere mortals. Behold: The Ultimate Squat Setup.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3qqUGa9sWE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>This might be the perfect demonstration of intensity and mobility coming together for ultimate lifting domination. This is a HIGHLY ADVANCED move – I suggest using a basic linear progression on your setup for quite some time before advancing to a weekly linear periodization, then tapering for 6-8 years and using an American Wave method before finally giving this a go. You’ve been warned.</p>
<p>Reader Dimitri sent in a couple pics of his 70sBig face – this was the best. He said something about being in Canadia in it, but we’ll let that slide this time, because he mentioned that many beers were consumed in the process of celebrating some sort of “hockey” victory. I guess that’s like football with funny accents?</p>

<p>I also had some great pics of young future-70sBiggers submitted by dads and uncles, but sorry guys, I’d feel weird about posting pics of kids. I still thought the pics were cute, though. Made me want a dog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last Friday, I recounted the <a href="/blog/2013/05/ryan-carrillo-at-ipf-bench-worlds/" target="_blank">soon-to-be-legendary story</a> of our buddy Ryan Carrillo showing up to IPF Bench Worlds and bringing home the gold on his final attempt. He got back in the states last night, and there was a news crew waiting for him at the airport – he’s a pretty medium deal. We’ve already heralded his achievements on this site, but showing some love to the news stations that cover this is only going to help them believe that powerlifting IS news. So, uhh, click these links, and let’s make one more small push to getting powerlifting the recognition it deserves. And if you don’t click the links…Ryan might just eat you. So do it. <a href="http://www.kens5.com/home/Local-wins-World-208841441.html" target="_blank">KENS5</a>, <a href="http://www.ksat.com/news/texas-state-student-becomes-world-bench-press-champion/-/478452/20355740/-/11f8bd9z/-/index.html" target="_blank">KSAT12</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Justin will be back writing SOON for everyone’s amusement. Til then, just lift more, and keep your short shorts on. It’ll be worth the wait.</p>
