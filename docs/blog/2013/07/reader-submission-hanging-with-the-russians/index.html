  <p>_If you missed it yesterday, we announced on our facebook page that Dmitry Klokov will be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NorwoodWeightlifing?fref=ts">coming to the US</a> with a bunch of his buddies to train and host seminars. If you live in the Northeast, this is probably something you don’t want to miss. _</p>
<p>_On that note, our friend Paul Sousa drafted a silly story on what he thinks a day hanging out with the Russians would entail. _</p>
<p><strong>A Perfect Day with Russians</strong></p>
<p>Who doesn’t love Russians?  Let’s be honest, if Louie Simmons is right about anything, it’s that Russians are awesome.  I was thinking about this fact the other day, and I began daydreaming about what a perfect day of hanging with some Russians would look like…</p>
<p>It would all begin with my Misha alarm clock playing some accordion music to wake me up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <em id="__mceDel"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.dvdtechcameras.com/gallery/yashma/7/7.jpg" width="540" height="360" /></em>
</p>
<p>After doing a little wake up dance to it I would head to the kitchen where Akkaev would have made me pancakes.  He makes the best pancakes.  We’d eat together and talk about the weather forecast, go-karts and the other usual stuff.  Then we’d strap on our KGB era rocket shoes and fly to the beach.</p>
<p>At the beach we’d meet up with Klokov and Belyaev for a rousing game of beach volleyball.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://users.telenet.be/tom.goegebuer/images/Santa%20Domingo06/SD%20Beach1.jpg" width="419" height="314" /></p>
<p>Tight jeans and body oil are the official uniforms of course.  Akkaev would set me for a killer spike to win the match, then we would all go get soft serve ice cream cones.  After that we’d rent paddle boats and have races.</p>
<p>After all our beach fun we’d be hungry, so we’d head to Malanichev’s house for a feast.  Malanichev and KK would have just gone bare hand bear hunting and brought back a couple grizzlies for the rotisserie.  We’d dine on bear meat and drink vodka, and after getting a bit tipsy we’d start wearing the grizzly heads as hats and reenact Where the Wild Things Are.  KK does the best wild rumpus.</p>
<p>All of this would have tired me out considerably, and Misha would descend from the heavens riding a milk carton.  He would fly me back home and tuck me into bed, then sing me sweet lullabies while I faded into dreamland.</p>
