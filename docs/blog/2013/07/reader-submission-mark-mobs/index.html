Hey guys, Mark here again. I’ve heard quite a few people complain about patellar and quad tendon pain and I figured out a good way, besides voodoo flossing (which you should also be doing) to deal with it. You need a lacrosse ball, and a sock you don’t plan on wearing again. You tie the lacrosse ball up in the sock and then you can use the ends as handles to put some pressure on the tendons with the ball as demonstrated in this vid.">

  <p>Patellar/Quad Tendon Mob</p>
<p>Hey guys, Mark here again. I’ve heard quite a few people complain about patellar and quad tendon pain and I figured out a good way, besides voodoo flossing (which you should also be doing) to deal with it. You need a lacrosse ball, and a sock you don’t plan on wearing again. You tie the lacrosse ball up in the sock and then you can use the ends as handles to put some pressure on the tendons with the ball as demonstrated in this vid.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELkoz-a86sI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>So you can probably spend 3 to 5 minutes on each knee 2 or three times a weeks, it’s a pretty simple mob and it makes a pretty huge difference in alleviating patellar pain while squatting, plus you can do it while lying in bed, watching tv, whatever, so there’s no real excuse not to do it if you have problems with your patellar and quad tendons.
