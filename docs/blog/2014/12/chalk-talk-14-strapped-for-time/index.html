  <p>This particular video tackles the problem a lot of people have during the holiday season: a lack of time for training. You don’t have to have an “all or nothing” attitude with your program. Even doing a short training session is better than none at all, and the chronic effect of training is more important than what you do today. It doesn’t have to be heavy, it doesn’t have to be a lot, but it does need to be systemic. The video shows an example of a quick workout as well as providing other examples with all the reasons why.</p>
