  <p>I’ve been away for a bit, and when I look around at the realm of strength and conditioning,  I see the good and bad.</p>
<p>The good? The training population swells with eager trainees aiming for a bigger deadlift, a beautiful snatch, or a better metabolic engine. We have awesome lifters in USAW, raw powerlifting is surging, and thousands of people _train _instead of fiddling around with exercise. This is good.</p>
<p>The bad? Everybody’s an expert. Strength and conditioning is interesting because if a guy is good at _doing _it, he is not automatically good at <em>teaching</em> it. Athlete X accomplishes Y and then opens up shop for consultations and seminars. I’m not saying there isn’t room in the market, but a lack of knowledge in physiology, anatomy, metabolism, programming, etc. results in a disservice to the student and customer. This is bad.</p>
<p>It’s rare that any of the new information is profound. Organizing performance training isn’t complicated and there are no secrets. Consider the following:</p>
<p>– Perform large compound strength movements like squat, press, bench, deadlift, row, and pull-ups on a regular basis.</p>
<p>– Address mobility and muscular imbalance/weakness issues.</p>
<p>– Don’t do a stupid amount of volume and avoid most aesthetic-focused programs.</p>
<p>– Understand “met-con” or “high intensity conditioning” does not mean “consisting of retarded shit all the time.”</p>
<p>– Organize the training week to apply stress and give subsequent rest.</p>
<p>– First, specify to your needs, then your wants.</p>
<p>These are the tenets of performance training. Stick to these concepts and you won’t really need a glistening six pack telling you “IF IT FITS YOUR MACROS.” I understand the “How and why?” are your limiting factor. Now that I’ve knocked some rust off, I’m here to help. If I can’t stream the content out, I’ll at least be a bubbling brook.</p>
