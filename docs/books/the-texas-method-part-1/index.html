<p>All readers on 70’s Big want to get strong, and almost all of them want to get big <em>and</em> strong. They will use a linear progression like Starting Strength or the Greyskull LP, yet seem sort of lost as to what to do next. The Texas Method is typically recommended, yet there isn’t a clear guide on how to transition into it, how to properly progress it, how to tweak it as you advance, or how to use it for sub-goals like weightlifting and swollertrophy. Until now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Justin,</p>
<p>I recently purchased your ebook on the Texas Method. First of all, thank you so much. I really appreciate you clarifying many questions I had about the intricacies of the program. I ran SS and completed it going from 155 to 205lbs. Im 6’0 and hope the TM can help me along to attaining my goal of becoming 220lb because thats the weight class I want to compete at when I powerlift. I’m now currently 16 weeks into TM and the information you provided will definitely benefit me greatly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
</blockquote>
