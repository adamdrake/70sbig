<p>Doug Young was a behemoth of a man who commanded respect for both his performance and his physique. He is a co-captain for 70’s Big and literally embodies what it means to be big and strong.</p>
<p>Young was a national and world champion multiple times throughout his career while competing in the 242 lb. weight class (he also competed in the 275 lb. class). In the 1977 nationals, he posted a 2017 pound total (squatting 722, benching 556, and deadlifting 738)…<strong>with three broken ribs</strong>. Doug was known for his benching ability, and is credited with bench of 612 pounds in 1978 while wearing just a t-shirt.</p>

<p>Anatoly Pisarenko was damn strong. He’s also got a mustache. These dominant qualities make him a co-captain of 70’s Big.</p>
<p>His career bests were a 206 kg snatch in 1983 (Moscow) and a 265 kg clean and jerk in 1984 (Varna) — this ties him for second overall for the highest clean and jerk (although world records say otherwise since old records were dropped with the restructuring of the weight classes). Pisarenko also had his personal best total in 1984 at Varna with a 465 kg total.</p>

<p>During his short career, Pisarenko broke 13 world records: 5 in the snatch, 4 in the clean and jerk, and 4 in the total of the snatch and clean and jerk (he lifted in the era after the clean and press was eliminated from competition). The Pizz won two USSR championships (1982 and ’84), four European championships (1981, ’82, ’83, and ’84), and three world championships (1981, ’82, and ’83).</p>

<p>Unfortunately Pisarenko lacks the fame of other successful weightlifters because he was unable to attend the 1980 and 1984 Olympics for different reasons. In 1980 he was not chosen to lift as a super heavyweight for the USSR because Sultan Rakhmanov  and Vasiliy Alexeev were heavier (150 and 185 kilograms respectively) and the favorites with a combined 79 world records. Pisarenko claims to have out-lifted both famous weightlifters in training whilst only weighing 114 kilograms, yet he was told he was not ready (he was only 21 years old in 1980). In 1984 the USSR held out of the Olympics. It must have been difficult for Pisarenko to see Dean Lukin of Australia win the gold with a total of 412.5 kilograms — a whopping 50 kilos less than what Pisarenko was capable of!</p>

<p>Pisarenko was disqualified for two years and decided to end his weighlifting career. It was time to make a living now that he was an adult and had a family. It’s sometimes hard to realize that Pisarenko was only between the ages of 22 and 27 during his lifting career — the mustache and build make him seem much older. He reported that he would have been ready for a 210 kg snatch and potentially 280 kg in the clean and jerk! In training, Pisarenko clean and jerked 270 kg for a single, 260 for a double, and cleaned 280 — impressive numbers for anyone, but especially since his bodyweight always hovered around 125 kilos.</p>

<p>Despite his lack of Olympic success, Pisarenko was still an impressive lifter. Big. Strong. Mustache. He sets the standard for 70s Big weightlifters.</p>

<p><em>Inducted 2/8/2012</em></p>
<p>It is my honor and pleasure to induct Swedish discus thrower Ricky Bruch posthumously into the 70’s Big Hall of Fame. Ricky Bruch had man battles throughout his life, yet he passed away on May 30, 2011 after his toughest battle, pancreatic cancer. He was 64.</p>
<p>[<img data-attachment-id="6290" data-permalink="/blog/2012/02/ricky-bruch-inducted-to-hof/ricky-bruch-2/" data-orig-file="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg" data-orig-size="350,249" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Ricky Bruch" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg" src="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="249" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6290" />][1]</p>
<p>Björn Rickard “Ricky” Bruch was an exceptional athlete, but failed to achieve the highest gold medal honors in international competition. Bruch placed 8th in the 1968 Olympic games in Mexico City with a discus throw of 59.28m. He won a bronze medal in the 1972 Olympic games in Munich with a discus throw of 63.40m but also equalled the world record in June 1972 with a throw of 68.40 meters. Bruch was also an outstanding shot putter with a lifetime best of 20.28 m and a bronze award from the European Championships in 1971.</p>
<p>Bruch made it to the next Olympic games in Montreal (1976), but did not make it past the qualifying rounds, an event that would spark his legacy. This failure set Bruch off, inspiring him to train harder than ever. He trained with tenacity and maniacal intensity for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. However, he was snubbed by the Swedish Olympic committee from competing. Bent on revenge, Bruch continued training and entered smaller competitions. Eventually in November of 1984 he set a new World and Swedish record with a 71.26m discus throw at 38 years old. This throw allowed Bruch to prove to himself, Sweden, and the world that he was the greatest thrower since the throw would have won the 1984 Olympic gold medal by nearly five meters. That throw places him 9th in the all-time list and still stands as the Swedish record today.</p>
<p>Some say that Bruch toed the line of insanity. That may be true, but his insanity was funneled into a supreme focus: to be as great as he could possibly be. This focused intensity inspired many, including this website, to devote to a mindset of success that brushes the realm of recklessness. Bruch was note solely a work-a-holic, <a href="/blog/2011/06/youre-welcome/" target="_blank">he enjoyed himself along the way</a>. Bruch has written a biography <em>Gladiatorns kamp</em> (The Gladiator’s Battle, released in 1990) and was the star of a documentary <em>Själen är större än världen</em> (<a href="http://www.johnpowellassociates.com/Ricky-Bruch.htm" target="_blank">The Soul Is Greater Than the World</a>). After a life of battle, rest in peace, and welcome to the 70’s Big Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>In order of awesomeness and artistic beauty, here is a comprehensive collection of Ricky Bruch videos (excluding the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIof5DcMpxc" target="_blank">documentary</a> itself).</p>
