  <h2 id="8220well-irsquom-a-lady-you-see-and-i-like-doing-lady-things8221">“Well, I’m a Lady, you see, and I like doing Lady Things.”</h2>
<p>70’s Big co-captain Doug Young was a behemoth, a mastodon if you will. Some of you veterans will remember one of the first videos we posted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n0QfcVXLug">about him</a> a while back. Doug was an excellent powerlifter, yet this particular video ironically showcases his bodybuilding “routine”. Kinda flies in the face of our emphasis on doing the barbell lifts in order to get strong and big, huh?</p>
<p>Well, obviously Doug didn’t use alternating dumbbell curls and dumbbell flies to bench 612 in a t-shirt, to routinely total 2,000 lbs, or to win multiple world and national championships. He wanted to <em>look</em> strong while actually <em>being</em> strong. And that is the point.</p>
<p><strong>Once you get your squat above, say, 500 pounds, then you can worry about doing curls.</strong></p>
<p>It is a waste of time to worry yourself with aesthetics if you are 150 pounds — training “arms” won’t make a damn difference. Your arms will grow with overall increases in mass. Not to mention aesthetic based training isn’t going to help you become more useful anyway.</p>
<p>And please, cut the bullshit about doing certain things “for the girls”. Trying to claim that you know what a girl wants is amusing and not all girls are alike anyways. Realistically the only reason you should be pressured into doing curls is if Welbourn and Max tell you that you need some hypertrophy training…</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>Brent was a little bothered by how none of you commented on his toilet scene in the <a href="http://vimeo.com/8743132">Tour of WFAC</a>. So, the unassuming Asian felt he had to step it up a notch.</p>
<p>Aside from having big traps and an extreme interest in interpretive dance, Brent is an Olympic weightlifter who is still growing into the 85 kilo weight class. He loves asking questions, eating good food, and typing nonsensical drivel to me in the wee hours of the night.</p>

<p>Q&amp;A posts accomplish several things. First, they answer questions that readers have, hopefully providing some decent information. Second, they invite a little more commentary than the typical information-only posts. Third, they allow a busy (lazy?) writer to avoid crafting and editing a long original post. So, without totally mailing it in, let’s answer some reader questions before the big article comes out.</p>
</br>
<p><strong><em>“Let’s say you have a trainee who TRULY exhausted their linear gains, ate right, etc. Would taking AAS after one’s linear progression put you back in “linear progression” mode since your recovery rate has increased again?” (Justin C)</em></strong></p>
</br>
<p>Good question. Let’s first talk about what it means to truly exhaust linear progression. Justin has previously mentioned how most people don’t finish linear progression. I would add the word “properly” as a modifier. I <em>finished</em> linear progression a couple years ago in that I added weight until I couldn’t anymore. However, I didn’t always eat or rest properly, so my recovery limited my progress. I exhausted linear progression <em>per se</em>, but I left about 15-40 pounds on each lift.</p>
</br>
<p>On the other hand, Justin and a handful of other guys did it right. I’m here to tell you that watching a guy train through his last weeks of linear progression is both inspiring and difficult. The amount of concentration and effort required to do this is staggering. Every set of squats looks like a five rep max—and it is. Yet they get under the bar and do it again two days later.</p>
</br>
<p>I recently spotted Brian (you’ve seen one of his videos) squatting 505 for three sets of five. I didn’t think he would finish his first set, yet he stood up with all 15 reps. It was amazing, and it looked like it nearly killed him. He looked to be within two workouts of finishing linear progression. Yet he went another month. I cannot overstate the amount of dedicated eating and resting this requires. That is what it takes to <em>truly</em> exhaust linear gains.</p>
</br>
<p>To answer Justin C’s question (finally!), yes, supplementation will yield more gains out of linear progression. And by more gains, I mean you will be linearly progressing for a longer period of time. We all have some “endpoint” by which we will exhaust linear gains. That endpoint is affected by genetics, training, and recovery factors. Steroids improve recovery by (simply speaking) enhancing anabolic (building) processes and minimizing and speeding up catabolic (tearing down) processes. By taking steroids, you are just moving your linear progression endpoint to the right (graphically speaking).</p>
</br>
<p>Rip has condemned steroid use for anyone on linear progression, and I agree. The consistent but modest loading and muscle building one experiences on linear progression helps the body and the nervous system adapt to increasing loads at a proper pace. Taking steroids and adding fifteen pounds to your squat every workout (instead of ten or five) spells trouble for a novice lifter who is still learning to squat correctly. It also robs you of the opportunity to truly find out what it takes—mentally and physically—to recover from this type of program.</p>
</br>
<p>So if you’re going to supplement steroids—and I’m not saying you should—you should wait until you’re nearly at the end of linear progression to do so. And I’m talking about the real dues-have-been-paid end of it. For example, if you reset your squat at 405 and again at 415, starting at a cycle at the third drop-down might get you to 435-445 (whereas you would have petered out at 420 before).</p>

</br>
<p><strong><em>“How much of the gains made on steroids persist after going off steroids if you were near your physical strength limits before steroids?” (Dr. McFacekick)</em></strong></p>
<p>It depends what you were taking, how much, and how you come off.</p>
</br>
<p>What you’re taking matters because some gear can be anabolic (promotes cell growth), androgenic (promotes virilization, or male characteristics), or both. As such, some are good for getting bigger and stronger, some are good for getting stronger but not bigger, and some are good for cutting fat while maintaining muscle mass (with no effect on strength).</p>
</br>
<p>A lot of the bulking agents (especially the heavy androgens) imply some amount of water retention, so true muscle size is inflated anyway on cycle. The question becomes how much of our non-water bulk do we keep when we come off cycle.</p>
</br>
<p>Generally speaking, you’ll maintain a greater percentage of your gains made off the milder (high anabolic/low androgenic) drugs. However, you will realize a greater net gain off of stronger gear (high anabolic and androgenic), assuming you come off properly.</p>
</br>
<p>Coming off properly refers to ending your cycle. When you’re on, your body stops producing its own testosterone in the presence of the artificial hormone. If you’re using a high enough dosage, some of the excess is being converted to estrogen in a process known as aromatization (this will all be covered). So you are in a situation where you have a surplus of estrogen but aren’t producing any testosterone. If you have ever dated an irrational woman (redundant?), you know how unstable this can be. So imagine quitting cold turkey and living like this.</p>
</br>
<div style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Low test--high estrogen doesn't end well.
  </p>
</div>
</br>
<p>The answer, of course, is to come off properly. This will be covered in detail later, but the simple course of dealing is to</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>address the estrogen issue by reducing androgens and taking a SERM (estrogen inhibitor) as you come off;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>restart natural testosterone production with HCG (gets the testes fired back up);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reset your hormone axis with Clomid;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deal with any outstanding Cortisol issues with Clenbuterol; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adjust your diet to deal with your old hormonal patterns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</br>
<p>This is not as hard as it sounds. And if it is done properly, you can keep a lot of your gains.</p>
</br>
<p>How much you are taking affects the gains you keep. When talking steroids, more is better in terms of gains. If you’re taking a small dose or a replacement dose, you can keep a lot of gains because the human body “understands” those hormone levels. However, if you’re taking 2 grams a week, i.e. super natural levels, your body will not be able to maintain those gains because the levels are so artificially high.</p>
</br>
<p>So it’s not a simple answer. If you run a low dose of testosterone for 12 weeks and come off properly, you can expect to 3-8 pounds (or more in some cases) of lean body mass, which is incredible over a three month period. If you’re popping Anadrol-50 from a Pez dispenser, nah, you don’t get to keep that.</p>

<p><strong><em>“But isn’t steroid supplementation cheating?” (Everyone)</em></strong></p>
</br>
<p>This is going to be the discussion question of the day.</p>
<p></br> There are a lot of variables, but let’s confine it to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Steroids are banned substances in professional sports;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are banned because they give a performance edge over someone who doesn’t take them;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional athletes take them because they give a competitive edge; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional athletes have to take them to stay competitive with other athletes who are using.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</br>
<p>Is it cheating? Absolutely. But cheating becomes a relative term in professional sports. It’s like playing poker where everybody is looking at everybody else’s cards.</p>
</br>
<p>Discuss.</p>

<p><em>Edit: I would like to point out that this post is not comprehensive. It only scratches the surface. Hopefully it helps you understand that tissues adapt to the forces that they encounter. In order to heal, tissues will need an adaptive stress in normal movement patterns, so this is how rehab is most effectively done.</em></p>
<p>I will ironically do my best to detail the common types of injuries in lifting and how we typically will treat them. It is kind of hard to sit in one spot because of my back, but I will press on for you, the reader. Justin Lascek; Man of the People.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Belly Injuries</strong></p>
<p>The most likely injury to happen is a muscle belly tear. Which muscle belly is dependent on the exercise being done, length of the warm-up, relative weight lifted, technique, and for some times for seemingly no god damn reason.</p>
<p>The standard protocol for muscle belly injuries is to wait till the initial bleeding process occurs, then make that muscle contract to get blood and lactate to it so that healing is promoted. This technique will also prevent any scar tissue forming as a result of the ancient and asinine “let it heal on its own” advice. We refer to this method as the Starr Rehab Protocol/Method/Whatever and it was originally developed by Bill Starr and has been taught by Mark Rippetoe since he learned it from Starr. The best description can be found <a href="http://www.startingstrength.com/resources/forum/showthread.php?t=7351">here</a>. There is no sense in discussing this any further, because Rip has already done so more than adequately.</p>
<p><strong>Back Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Back injuries are less common than muscle belly injuries, and are almost always caused by a form fault. The most typical reason that the back would structurally come out of alignment in a properly performed squat, deadlift, power clean, etc. will be when the upper or lower back undergoes flexion. My experience (coaching and otherwise) has been that this will happen right off the floor in a pull and during the beginning of the “up” phase in a squat (as the bounce or rebound occurs). You can have an over-extension of the back as well, but flexion-type injuries will be more common in a less experienced lifter. Sometimes the back can be slightly out of alignment before lifting at all, and then the additional load causes the problem.</p>
<p>Back injuries usually involve a wonky alignment of the spine, and this typically irritates the surrounding tissue. An ideal rehab protocol will include both spinal adjustment or manipulation as well as soft tissue treatment. Assuming there isn’t anyone in your gym that can do this, you’ll have to find a good chiropractor. I don’t know much about the practice of chiropractic, but my understanding is that more of them are getting involved in treating the soft tissue along with spinal adjustments. Some are familiar with A.R.T. as well, so finding one that can treat muscle tissue will be more useful. The good news is that most back injuries will heal on their own over time, assuming you are delicate with the rehab process.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that a back injury will not be rehabbed in the same way that a muscle belly will be. A couple days after the initial injury back extensions can be done for high reps in order to help the muscles around the injury, and squats and/or deadlifts can follow the day after. It is not uncommon for the injury to be a little painful while under a compressive load (at the top of a squat or deadlift). Halting deadlifts can be done (from the floor to just above the knee) early on so that you can get the isometric back work off the floor while avoiding any compressive forces that would be associated with the lockout — just try a light deadlift and see first. You won’t squat or deadlift for reps since you aren’t trying to heal a muscle belly that is going to be contracting eccentrically or concentrically — the muscles of the back are postural and will only act isometrically. This means that you would just do sets of five, starting with the bar and working up SLOWLY to what you can handle that day. Nobody can decide this but you, and you ideally would have to decide if you will work up to a single set, or do some sets across. Your goals will include not pushing it too far, especially early on, and keeping your back in complete extension whether it is in your lumbar or thoracic spine. The injury should be fine in two weeks at the most with the average time around a week to a week and a half.</p>
<p>Until the injury is fully healed, you will have to have some extra warm-up on your back prior to squatting. This can be done with back extensions, reverse hypers, extra sets of squats, or even a heat pad. Mike Street at <a href="http://www.eastside-sc.com/">Eastside Strength and Conditioning</a> has this “thing” that has pre-heated towels in it, and when we did a seminar there last I used it before training. It was delightfully useful.</p>
<p><strong>Wrist and Elbow Injuries</strong></p>
<p>If you are just doing the linear progression, and you are experiencing elbow or wrist pain, this is most likely due to a grip problem on the squat. You are supporting some percentage of the weight in one or both of those joints instead of solely supporting it on your back. Shoulder flexibility is more than likely the limiting factor in getting into a correct position. Consult <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=312&amp;action=show_detail">Starting Strength</a> if you are confused about how your hands and wrists should be aligned. If flexibility is, in fact, the problem, then you may want to get a releasing massage — this will be quicker than trying to improve your crappy flexibility over time on your own.</p>
<p>If you are a weightlifter, then you may run into wrist and elbow problems during the jerk or snatch. These injuries are rare, but more serious. Dislocated elbows and broken wrists are going to require some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgFLPzOMMt0&amp;feature=related">professional help</a>. Since they are less likely to occur, they leave the scope of this post.</p>
<p>The <strong>worst thing</strong> you can do with any of these injuries is to leave it alone and expect it to heal on its own. We always rehab injuries using compound, systemic movements. We use the press and chin-ups to heal shoulders and the squat to heal any muscle belly injury in the hips or legs. <strong>Isolation movements are a waste of time</strong> since they do not allow the muscle to function in the same way that it will in normal daily activities or any athletic endeavor.</p>

<p>Most activities that are rewarding are difficult. If you involve yourself in things that are difficult, you will undoubtedly encounter some obstacles in order to obtain the reward. This is a frustrating yet necessary truth.</p>
<p>Barbell training is a low risk, high reward activity. You train, get stronger, enhance athletic ability, learn to be mentally and physically tough, and ultimately become more useful for things like moving furniture, tossing small children, and lifting attractive women (men?).</p>
<p>Yet, there will be obstacles in barbell training. When training correctly, bad things won’t happen often, but they will happen nonetheless. Set backs can come in the form of missed lifts, recovery problems, scheduling problems, and the most unfortunate…injuries.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a set back, the logical step is to <strong>identify what went wrong and fix that thing so that you don’t do it wrong in the future</strong>. If you are under-recovered from lack of food, sleep, or sandwiches, then you need to remedy your situation. Schedules can be worked around, but injuries are a big giant pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Injuries usually happen because of form faults. This is why having a coach in some regard is useful and necessary. If Rip hasn’t watched me squat in a few weeks, I will typically require some kind of feedback to validate what I am already doing, or to tweak a small problem. Last year I squatted in some capacity two or three times a week, every week. I have seen at (the very least) 20,000+ squats in the past year. This means that I typically know exactly what the hell I’m doing wrong right when I do it, but little cues from Rip help clean up the movement. In other words, everybody needs a coach, and the extent of how often they need one depends on their experience.</p>
<p>Injuries unfortunately will also occur…”just because”. When a person is lifting significant amounts of weight, the margin for error decreases because of the injury potential (another reason why having a coach is useful — they can prevent or correct that error). Last week Chris, who has chosen to train for powerlifting and strong man, tweaked his low back while power cleaning. Today I tweaked my back (which was already tired from traveling home yesterday) on my second set of squatting. These injuries are irritating for Chris and I. It is easy to get frustrated when injured, and it is easy to make the injury worse by doing too much too soon. Furthermore, when you put it in the context of progress goals and/or a meet schedule, it can be really fucking frustrating.</p>
<p>But, here’s the deal. Instead of getting all pissed off or upset by injuries, there is only one useful mindset: <strong>Figure out what went wrong, fix it in the mean time, and implement a strategy for doing it better in the future.</strong></p>
<p>Read that again. This is one of those lessons that resonates out of the realm of barbell training. Such logic can and should be used outside of the gym. The harsh reality is that bad shit is going to happen to you all the time, including when under the bar. Realize that this is normal, and how you respond is going to define your success.</p>
<p>Tomorrow in Part 2 I’ll talk about some guidelines for working through or around a given injury.</p>

  <p>Things have been a bit hectic since the internet was screwy last week and then we traveled to San Diego for a Starting Strength Seminar this past weekend.</p>
<p>There are quite a few people from the seminar that have a lot of strength to gain. Don’t think that these seminars are just for people who are experienced or strong; we had someone who weighed 130 pounds. There is no sense in ribbing him in the comments. Trust me, he received enough of that at the seminar. He, and some others, are aware of what they need to do in the coming months to get stronger and bigger. I look forward to hearing about their progress, and assuming they are successful, we will post their story about their quest to getting 70’s Big.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to sign up for the seminar because you may think you aren’t “good enough”. Everyone comes out of the weekend with a better working knowledge of how barbell training works, they are better at coaching it, and they are better at doing it. Ther people who were brave enough to attend did very well.</p>
<p>In the mean time, check out this sweet-ass compilation of 70’s Big fan favorite Ricky Bruch:</p>

<p>Justin is currently out of town. So here is a video of Dylan. He trains with me in Statesboro. He exhausted the linear progression so I gave him the go-ahead to max out on his Deadlifts</p>

  <p>Apparently the whole town is having Internet issues. I was going to post for Justin, but my connection sucks, too, so I”m going mobile. Sorry, guys.</p>
</br>
<p>It has been a month since I did the steroid primer post. I have spent the last several weeks gathering facts and talking to current and former steroid users about the ins and outs of supplementation. I should have something pretty good for you by next week.</p>
</br>
<p>So, in addition to your normal PR Friday posts, ask me any questions you want answered about steroids and I”ll try to cover it next week.</p>
</br>
<p>In the meantime, check the trailer for BSF.</p>

  <h2 id="why-eat-lots">Why Eat Lots</h2>
<p>Part 3 – Special Pops Recap</p>
<p><strong>Edit: I do not know why the comments were turned off, but you can comment now.</strong></p>
<p>The material I have been covering in the “Why Eat Lots” posts has been covered multiple times on this website as well as by Rip in his <a href="http://www.startingstrength.com/resources/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=129">Q&amp;A</a> on the <a href="http://startingstrength.com/">Starting Strength</a> website. Nevertheless, let’s go through it again.</p>
<p>Note: Advice on strength training typically assumes a regular, healthy individual. However, individuals are individuals. There may be disorders, diseases, allergies, quirks, etc. that make you unique. Just use some common sense.</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong></p>
<p>Typically girls won’t be eating the same type of food as Skinny Guy. This should be intuitive. A girl probably won’t be drinking a gallon of milk a day and eating four hearty meals (although I have heard of girls drinking that much milk, but we’ll call that an outlier). In general, a woman who is new to training will need to eat much more protein than she was when she was not training. The breakdown of muscle requires protein to repair it, and an excess is needed in order for the existing muscle to grow.</p>
<p>How much excess calories a female will eat will usually depend on her body frame, how skinny she is, how she is training, etc. Skinny girls are free to eat whatever, but will usually have to be encouraged to eat more in order to recover properly. If the weight can’t be lifted in the next workout, then she more than likely didn’t eat enough. A girl in this situation might need to record a day or two of her food intake to get an idea of what she is actually eating. She may also need someone else — a coach, friend, but not a spouse — to remind her what the goal is so that she commits to eating for recovery. A skinny girl is free to drink any amount of milk.</p>
<p>If a girl is of a medium frame, or in other words is not in a position where she needs to gain weight, but needs her composition to change over to muscle, then she should probably keep her carbohydrate intake low while increasing her protein intake. If lifting is a new method of training, her metabolism and body composition will change as a result — ASSUMING a proper program is adhered to and adequate protein is eaten. A medium girl may need to limit milk intake.</p>
</br>
<p>If a girl is of a large frame and/or is in a position where she needs to lose body fat, then she will keep the carbohydrate intake low, plenty of protein to recover and aid the increasing metabolism, and she should eliminate milk from her diet. Milk is something that makes baby mammals grow, and if she is trying to drop body fat, then she does not need any help growing. She will probably benefit from some conditioning sessions throughout the week. Short, intense, sprint-like endeavors can be done after she lifts, especially if she is untrained. An untrained woman will not have any trouble recovering from an additional conditioning work load until 6 weeks in at the earliest. Assuming she is untrained, rowing sprints will be one of the best things to use until her strength has increased to a point where she can use some other methods like running, prowling, barbell complexes, etc.</p>
<p>The biggest problem most females will have is with trusting a barbell training program. Skinny girls have been told their whole lives that being skinny is not only okay, but it is preferable. They also think they are going to get “bulky” — a ridiculous assumption since a female has one tenth the testosterone as a guy. The percentage of females that can actually build muscle easily have already done so to some extent, so the skinny girl doesn’t have anything to worry about.</p>
<p>A woman’s body obviously functions different hormonally, so it makes sense that their dietary requirements are going to differ from a male doing the same program. However, the same rules still apply: stronger is better, and muscle is harder to gain than fat is to lose.</p>
<p><strong>Fat Guys</strong></p>
<p>I really shouldn’t have to address this again, but a fat guy needs to stop eating a whole bunch of carbs. He probably should eliminate milk from his diet until it becomes necessary for recovery. In other words, a paleo-type approach with plenty of protein is on the agenda. If the guy is pretty damn fat, the barbell training alone will change his body composition over time. In such a case, some conditioning may be done, but ONLY if it does NOT interfere with the strength recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Old Guys</strong></p>
<p>Old guys usually know that their body doesn’t function as well as it did when they were 20 years old. They can still go through a linear progression, but some tweaks may need to be made. They obviously will not eat like a 20 year old skinny kid though. Plenty of meat and fat, and they would watch the carbs. If they started gaining too much fat, they could pull the carbs back down. Standard deal.</p>
<p><strong>Old Gals</strong></p>
<p>It has been my experience that you are lucky if old gals are willing to make a change in their life in general. They have been under pressure from the media and society about body image and what a “proper diet” is longer than younger girls. Get them training consistently first, then worry about food. Typically they will need more protein, but at this point training is about staving off the nursing home as opposed to attracting the opposite sex or competing in sport.</p>
<p>If there are any relevant populations that you think I need to highlight, slap it in the comments.</p>

  <p>We are having technical difficulties regarding internet availability at the gym. Please do not post a bunch of stupid shit. The issue should be resolved by mid afternoon (Wednesday). In the mean time, here are some videos that should entertain you.</p>
<p>Strong weightlifter:</p>

<p>If you sign up for the <a href="http://aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=212">Starting Strength Seminar</a> at the <a href="http://wfac-gym.com">Wichita Falls Athletic Club</a>, you may get to experience some of this:</p>

<p>In case you guys missed it, AC and I were on <a href="http://ironradio.org/">Iron Radio</a> last Friday. You can listen to the show <a href="http://ironradio.org/Audio/41Ironradio_70s_Big.mp3">here</a>. Thoughts, questions, and observations are welcome on the interview.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>There are still quite a few spots open for the <a href="http://aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=212">Starting Strength Seminar</a> at the <a href="http://wfac-gym.com">Wichita Falls Athletic Club</a> in Wichita Falls, TX at the end of February. This is your opportunity to train and learn at one of the best gyms in the country. Here is a tour:</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/8743132">WFAC Virtual Tour</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user802431">A.C.</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>I commend some of you for not only answering questions in the comments over the weekend but also defending against a few ridiculous statements from certain posters. It is easy to take anything that we say out of context or incorrectly assume it applies to every spectrum of the population. As this website grows, there will continue to be ridiculous comments and/or trolls. As a general rule, these intellectual children can be ignored.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>A new t-shirt order will be in stock shortly. Also, I am working on a couple of other interesting designs. Stay tuned.</p>
