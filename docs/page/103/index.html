  <p>I didn’t have time to write tonight, so this is Gary Gibson’s update on his situation. Also, it is PR Friday, so talk about any PR’s you had this week in the comments: weight gained, lifted, or consumed. Giddyup.</p>
<p><strong>Justin and A.C. are on Iron Radio today today at 2 pm eastern time. <a href="http://www.attendthisevent.com/Modern/?eventid=11031834">Listen here</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Did Nature Mean to Make Us So Skinny And Useless?</strong></p>
<p>This week I am officially a big step closer to manhood. I’ve been weighing in consistently between 183 and 188 lbs. That’s about a 25-lb increase in the past 30 days. Squat and Milk. Granted I hit a high of 176 a month prior to the start of this latest cycle, so half of that weight is reclaimed ground, not new territory. Still, the way my weight and my lifts are going, I’m going to get to 200 lbs (and a triple bodyweight squat i hope) a lot sooner than I would have believed just a few months ago.</p>
<p>An adult male of average height should weigh at least 200 lbs…at least he should if he wants to be strong. If all he wants to do is run away from danger or difficult situations at low speeds, then he’s much better off jogging a lot and “watching what he eats” so he stays at 150.</p>
<p>But those 200 lbs of useful man assume both a reasonable bodyfat percentage and strength level. Reasonably fat is under 20%, but not the “about 10%” that gets tossed about so casually. Reasonably strong is a 1.5x bodyweight squat. (Athletes in strength and power sports may want to shoot for over double bodyweight and those in the barbell sports should aim for triple.)</p>
<p>Those guidelines are all well and good. But I got to wondering just why it is that so many adult males of average height are about 150 lbs with the low strength levels to match. And an awful lot of the adult males who are over 200 don’t train properly and are “skinny-fat weak” and wish they were just plain skinny weak 150-pounders. What gives? How did this happen? We didn’t evolve with barbells, and there’s no way in hell I could get to 200 without using a barbell for heavy back squatting. No amount of physical activity I would have been likely to do in the ancestral environment would have gotten me close.</p>
<p>Ultimately I don’t care all that much what nature had in store for my body sans barbell training. I’m happier, healthier and a hell of a lot stronger and less painful to look at thanks to my journey to over 200 lbs. Moreover the speed at which this metamorphosis is taking place tells me that it was meant to be.</p>

  <h2 id="why-eat-lots">Why Eat Lots?</h2>
<p>Part 2 – The Health Hysteria</p>
<p>Eating more than enough is important to grow, and growing is necessary if one is going to get stronger. The fact that growth is required to get stronger shouldn’t be novel, especially with how much I <a href="/?p=374">have</a> <a href="/?p=157">written</a> <a href="/?p=928">about</a> <a href="/?p=450">it</a>.</p>
<p>I am under the impression that nobody here thinks you can continuously gain strength in a linear fashion forever, nor do they think that body weight gains will continuously increase. There is this thing called “diminishing returns” that shows up a lot in life (economics, strength gains, running fast, etc.). In other words, in a given situation where increases have been made, more is required to make the same increase, so improvement is slower. Progress is made, albeit slowly.</p>
<p>In other words, you will not forever be in “mass gaining mode”. Nobody here has ever suggested that you eat tons of food when you don’t need to. If you are Fat Guy, you don’t need to be going ape shit with the milk shakes and large pizzas, even though it may be fun. If you are a girl who needs to gain weight or get stronger, you obviously won’t have the same dietary requirements as Skinny Guy does because you are hormonally different. However, if you <em>are</em> Skinny Guy, then you better throw down if you want to get strong.</p>
<p>Skinny Guy has an interesting task. He needs to drink a gallon of milk a day and eat four hearty meals. He needs to have eggs-a-plenty, bacon, and toast for breakfast. Skinny Guy should be consuming meat throughout the day and inhaling trail mix. There are hundreds of ways to add calories — hop on over to the <a href="/?page_id=7">Food FAQ</a> for help or ideas. After getting more than enough protein, Skinny Guy will purposely be sloppy with his caloric intake if he is going to get as strong as possible in the shortest amount of time. <strong>If Skinny Guy is going to spend valuable time in the gym training, then he my as well eat, recover, and thrive so he doesn’t waste his or my time</strong>.</p>
<p>Skinny Guy may have been just Average Joe prior to his linear progression, or perhaps he was one of those “clean eaters”. It is understandable that Skinny Guy would fear eating tons of calories. After all, he is scared of losing his abs. Skinny (Weak) Guy shouts, “Hey, isn’t this unhealthy? I don’t want to have health problems!” Really, Skinny Guy?</p>
<p>The problem with this silly assumption is that it assumes you should eat like Homer Simpson for the rest of your life. Once you are done gaining lots of body weight, then you eat to maintain mass and/or increase lean body mass.</p>
<p>Since Skinny Guy is only going to be eating like this until he is no longer Skinny Guy, health issues are completely irrelevant. Do you really think that eating like The Blob for six months is going to pose long-term health risks? Unless you have some kind of pre-existing condition, You’ll Be Fine.</p>
<p>Besides, when you are training hard competitively, you must recover if you are going to succeed or improve. This requires lots of calories, and you must get them any way you can. When you instantly use the fuel you consume to repair your body, problems don’t exist. In other words, you can’t compare the effects of a sedentary person eating like shit and someone who trains very, very hard. I laughed when all of those assholes said that if they only “cleaned up” Michael Phelps diet, he would be an even better performer. The food he eats is the only way he can physically consume the calories that his body needs in order to recover. If training hard is a normal part of your life, you will eventually learn this.</p>
<p>A) If you are under weight, you must eat lots and lots to not be under weight.</p>
<p>B) If you eat lots, you are doing this for the sole reason to get stronger by increasing your mass.</p>
<p>C) Unless you have pre-existing conditions, six months of eating sloppy is not going to adversely affect your health. It takes years of unhealthy habits to start causing problems. Just ask your parents.</p>
<p>D) Inefficient people are annoying, so just eat the fucking food.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will finish up by detailing food intake for the lifting population that doesn’t start with “Skinny” or end with “Guy”.</p>

  <h2 id="why-eat-lots">Why Eat Lots?</h2>
<p>Part 1 – The Conceptual Understanding</p>
<p>I realize a lot of you are new to all of this. You are possibly new to strength training and eating in order to recover from that training as well as increasing muscular body weight. Even if you have been involved in some kind of training, you may still be new to what we recommend on this website. It’s okay.</p>
<p>Let’s pretend you work in an office building and you have to make managerial decisions. Construction needs to occur in half of the building so that the plumbing can be fixed along with the installation of a network infrastructure to make things more efficient. Everybody that works for you gets moved to the other half of the building, and both guys and girls have to use the same toilet. Do you think it would be logical if I came up to you and said, “Uh…<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Dp_DMAQAg">Mr. Lumbergh</a>? I have to poop a lot, and now the women will always smell it for the rest of my life because they will forever share a bathroom with me. Please ignore the fact that my overuse of toilet paper is why we are fixing the plumbing in the first place.”</p>
<p>Assuming Lumbergh doesn’t can your ass on the spot, he is going to have to remind you that A) you brought this on yourself since you ruined the plumbing, B) this is obviously not a permanent thing since the other half of the building will open up after construction is over, and C) the entire office will run more smoothly after the new infrastructure installation, so just fucking deal with it. Yeah…</p>
<p>Look, when I tell you to eat lots of food so that you can not only satisfy the necessary protein and caloric requirements for training, but also an excess of both to stimulate new tissue growth, I’m not telling you to do this for the rest of your life. Why do you suddenly think I am recommending that everyone should ALWAYS eat triple bacon cheeseburgers and a bowl of ice cream with magic shell and brownies?</p>
<p>The terms don’t change. If you are fat or skinny, you have done something to make yourself fat or skinny. You have to do something different if you want a different result. Since the majority of both guys and girls are underweight and weak, they will have to train and eat more to get stronger and bigger. Since stronger is better, they need to do this ASAFP.</p>
<p>It is implied that you will no longer look like a skinny, useless human after getting stronger. This is the point. Emaciation is in vogue and stylish, and we aim to put an end to this societal quirk. The skinnier and more weightless you are, the more extreme your eating can and will be to make the most efficient gains. If you are a competitor and train very hard, you will need to eat even more to recover from your training.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Thing #1:</strong> You brought this on yourself by being weak and probably skinny in the same way that the guy in the story ruined the plumbing with his belligerent bowel movements.</p>
<p>If you aim to get as strong as possible in the most efficient amount of time — which would be the sensible use of your training time and resources — then you will inconvenience yourself with eating lots of food so that you recover and GROW.</p>
<p><strong>Thing #2:</strong> You must make the sacrifice to change your habits to achieve results that are different than where you started. The guy in the story was unhappy with the women in his building inhaling his acrid aroma, but he is going to have to deal with it during this period of change — ESPECIALLY because it is his fault in the first place.</p>
<p>There is no reason you have to continue eating sloppy in the event you reach an appropriate body weight for your frame. This would be irresponsible and ill-advised in the long-term. Even though you are gaining muscle and fat, the majority of it will be muscle if you are training and eating correctly. Correctly means following a program (the novice linear progression from <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=312&amp;action=show_detail">Starting Strength</a> always produces results if properly followed), and proper eating means eating a quantity of protein that corresponds with your desired weight (1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight) as well as enough calories to recover and increase body weight.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that by doing this, you are gaining both strength and muscular body weight. The strength increase is the whole point and is universally useful (Note: especially in zombie survival scenarios). So what if you lose your abs? <strong>Abs were not meant to be concave</strong>. Besides, when you hit that appropriate body weight, you can adjust your diet so that body fat can be reduced. However, care must be taken that body weight is not lost — it’s obvious that a 230 pound man must eat differently than a 150 pound boy.</p>
<p><strong>Thing #3:</strong> The goal is to gain strength, and this is ultimately useful. In the story above, the guy overlooks the fact that his office building will be much more efficient with the new infrastructure. This is analogous to your body functioning better with whatever it is you are trying to do. All athletic qualities are increased and augmented (automatically or through practice and conditioning), you will live longer, and you can wow your friends by tossing small children over houses.</p>
<p>In Part 2 tomorrow I will talk about why the majority of you are wasting your time when you worry about the health considerations for eating to grow.</p>

  <h2 id="8220by-the-beard-of-zeus8221">“By the beard of Zeus!”</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed Gary’s post yesterday — it made me cry tears of joy. I have enjoyed reading Gary’s post on the <a href="http://www.startingstrength.com/resources/forum/index.php">Starting Strength Forums</a>, but every time I would watch a video of him squatting, I would think, “Egad! Surely there is food where this guy lives…” In any case, I am excited to see Gary gaining body weight. He will be formidable indeed.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question; after seeing Gary’s picture from 20 years ago, do you think he is genetically gifted? Did he have the qualities that make him a genetic freak? The answer is an obvious no.</p>
<p>I do know that Gary has busts his ass to get where he is now. Most of the people that are highlighted on this site have done the same. None of us are exceptionally gifted. AC was less than 185 pounds until last year, I squatted 325 for my work sets my first day at the <a href="http://wfac-gym.com">WFAC</a>, and Chris was just a low 400s deadlifter a year ago. We are not special.</p>
<p>The thing that we have in common is that we train correctly, and we train very fucking hard. Someone asked me how many training days I had missed last year. When I thought real hard about it, I realized I didn”t miss any. Sure, I had to take forced breaks because of (irritating and unnecessary bouts of) overtraining and getting sick, but I never missed scheduled training days. In other words: we are not dicking around.</p>
<p>Furthermore, nobody seems to have eating problems at the WFAC. Besides, if they do, the are berated until such problems are resolved. Here is a real conversation that occurred between a skinny high school kid and me:</p>
<p>“How was that set?”</p>
<p>“It was pretty good. You’re doing a better job of bouncing out of the bottom since your knees are shoved out, but it would look better if you gained 20 pounds.”</p>
<p>“Aww, I’m trying!”</p>
<p>“No. You aren’t.”</p>
<p>For example, I got sick and had a few set backs before a weightlifting meet a couple of weekends ago. One scale in the gym said I was about 225. I weighed in at 100.2 kilos at the meet (in my skivvies). This means that I weighed 220 in a weight class that is capped at 231. This was mega embarrassing since I run a mother truckin’ website dedicated to not being a wee man. I was pretty pissed off (especially with the results of the meet), so I started eating seriously that day while still in Austin. I got chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, scallop potatoes, and macaroni and cheese for dinner. Then a half gallon of milk on the ride home, among other goodies. Six days later on Friday I weighed in at 228 on the lighter scale at the gym, 230 on the other. In other words, I gained about eight pounds in six days. While starting at 220. And Skinny Guy is pumped about gaining five pounds in a few weeks. Bah…</p>
<p>When I started working with and training with Chris, he was about 245. He has accidentally gained weight while getting a great deal stronger. His deadlift started in the low 400s and we got it up to doing 540×5. He easily pulled 600 for a single, and has since been doing rack pulls and haltings (intermediate programming style). He has done 515×8 on haltings (an exercise that has no hip extension, just knee extension off the floor) and 575×5 on rack pulls (an exercise that has no knee extension, just hip extension with the bar starting right below the patella). I expect him to pull 700 in the next few months. Oh, and did I mention that he accidentally weighs 285? That’s right, his normal diet (that does not include many carbs) makes him gain muscle consistently. And no, he is not on steroids — none of us are. <strong>That bastard ate 21 pork chops in two days last week</strong>. That was not a typo. 21 pork chops. In two days.</p>
<p>I told Brent about this online:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>me: chris ate 21 pork chops in two days</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent: chris is a man</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>me: that he is, brent, that he is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent: i wish he were my dad</p>

</div>
<p>Look, the point is that getting bigger and stronger is a lot of hard work in and out of the gym. We train very hard. We don’t think we are done with the linear progression when things seem hard. Likewise, volume days in the Texas Method are grueling, sometimes painful endeavors. AC has helped a lot of guys get strong in Statesboro, and I have helped a lot of people get strong in Wichita Falls. Neither of these cities are a mecca for genetically gifted strength athletes. We just help people train hard, eat right, and they will inevitably get strong. Make sure that this is what you are doing.</p>

  <p><em>The following is a post by Gary Gibson, a friend and contributor on the Starting Strength forums.</em></p>
<p>At 5’10″ and a little over 160 lbs, I used to cling to the absurd notion that I was somehow past quick “newbie” gains. You see, about 15 years ago I graduated from college at my full adult height and weighing only around 130 lbs. This looked as frighteningly malnourished as you imagine. I wondered why women didn’t take me seriously as a potential mate even though I had a dazzling smile and a razor sharp eight-pack.</p>
<p>I spent the next decade squatting deeply, but with poor form. My overall programming was even worse and I fell under the sway of nonsense like HIT and partial-rep training. About five years ago, I convinced myself that I “just wasn’t built to squat and bench press” and dedicated myself to the deadlift, various overhead presses and chin ups. I also got into learning the full versions of the Olympic lifts even though I was only about 150 lbs with a shaky 245-lb squat to legal depth.</p>
<p>About three years ago, I recognized my scrawny nonsense for what it was when I had a confrontation with a much larger guy in my construction job and had to back down because I realized that I was grossly outsized and outmatched, despite being able to full squat snatch my own bodyweight.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, I started taking the squat seriously again and got it up to 315 lbs while I hit a bodyweight of 160 lbs. About a year after that I entered my first powerlifting competition and squatted 347 lbs with just a belt and knee sleeves in the 75 kg class. I thought I’d done pretty well considering how light and weak I had always been. I convinced myself that I couldn’t possibly gain much more weight and that at best I’d get a bit stronger in my current weight class and then that would be it.</p>
<p>By this time I’d read Starting Strength and started frequenting Rip’s online forum. I kept hearing about this GOMAD stuff, but just didn’t think it applied to me. After all, I’d been training properly for at least a couple of years and had gotten over three wheels on the squat! But Rip told me something that really stuck with me: “At your height you have to weigh 198 at least to be a competent powerlifter.”</p>
<p>198? Just didn’t seem possible. But I’d been bitten by the powerlifting bug and really wanted to get as big and strong as I could. So I started buying several gallons of milk at a time and dedicating myself to drinking a gallon each day.</p>
<p>I’d gotten as high as the mid-170s with a 405-lb squat, but then I cut weight for what was supposed to be my third meet in December 2009. This decision came after a lot of deliberation. At my level, getting bigger and stronger should supersede making weight classes. Ironically the meet got canceled because of a snowstorm that crippled the entire region. I got down to 164, but I lost a lot of strength. This proved to be a perfect chance to prove the power of GOMAD and squats.</p>
<p>A week after the meet cancellation I embarked on a program of volume squats and bench presses, fueled by GOMAD. Almost exactly one month later I am 20 lbs heavier than that low of 164 and my 5RM squat has become the weight I use for sets of five across. Let me make that clear: I was 164 lbs last month with a max squat of around 370; one month later I’m 184 lbs and am on track to a max squat of around 440. Will I actually squat 440 or more? Well, I could barely squat 335 for five last month and last night I used that weight for six sets of five…and the cycle isn’t even half over. You can keep track of my progress by reading my log on the Starting Strength site.</p>
<p>To be big and strong I need to weigh at least 200 lbs at this height with a final goal around 220. I wonder how many other skinny minnies are malingering in gyms across the world, crying about skinny wrists and hard gaining. Funny thing is, I still don’t look “big”–and I’m far from 70’s Big–despite a 20% increase in overall mass. I have to shake my head in disbelief when I imagine myself at 5’10″ and 150 lbs and thinking that that was Just Fine. 150 lbs is just fine…if you’re 5’4″. If you’re a male of the average 5’8″ to 5’10″, you need to weigh around 200 lbs if you want to be strong. You need to squat, eat big, and drink your GOMAD.</p>
<p>If you’re starting out at 150 and under, then the eating big and the GOMAD can be scary and uncomfortable. It’s going to seem like your gut’s getting way to big for your skinny little limbs. But stick with it. Once your gut is full and round, your body will take this as a sign that it has the reserves to support growth. You will not grow if your body “thinks” it is in permanent semi-starvation mode. So eat big, drink your GOMAD and keep upping your squat.</p>

<p><strong>Starting Strength Seminar in Wichita Falls, TX</strong></p>
<p>If you are on the quest to get 70’s Big or have considered coaching other people to get strong, then check out the new <a href="http://aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=212">Starting Strength Seminar</a>. You will learn the nitty gritty details on mechanics and anatomy, and then apply those lessons while coaching other people and getting coached while under the bar. There will be one at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club in Wichita Falls, Texas on February 26-28. This would be a good chance to train and learn at one of the <a href="/?p=1096">best gyms in the country</a>.</p>

<p>Listen Skinny Guy, you aren’t trying. You sit down at night and wonder why you aren’t getting stronger as you pick at chicken breast and broccoli. You might even be the guy eating a bowl of cereal for breakfast…like a child.</p>
<p>It’s time to man up Skinny Guy. I don’t like skinny guys, much less you, Skinny Guy. You either think you ought to be skinny like all of the psuedo-manly guys on TV and in movies or you like to be skinny. If you didn’t like being skinny, you’d do something about it. You would take your skinny jeans and skull cap off (you probably wear the skull cap in summer time too), and you would engage in activity that would require you to not be skinny.</p>
<p>Some of you Skinny Guys have actually decided to do something about it, but you haven’t gotten past this phase of BITCHING about everything that goes on. If your name is Skinny Guy and you don’t gain five pounds in the first week of training, then you aren’t trying. Guys in our gym gain 15 pounds in two or three weeks. I have heard some of you rejoice in the fact that you gain five pounds in a month. That disgusts me, Skinny Guy. I know you’ve been skinny your whole life, but get over the fear of gaining some kind of bodyfat. Your name is Skinny Guy for chrissakes! As we have said before, <strong>if you have been skinny your whole life, you don’t get to have an opinion on being fat</strong>.</p>
<p>Things that are worth doing are typically not easy, but some of you give up and think that you have a special scenario that requires some kind of unique advice that is not A) eat more food, B) squat, press, and deadlift, and C) stop your whiny bitching.</p>
<p>For some reason I have been in a foul mood, and I think it is Skinny Guy’s fault. My patience is wearing thin. If you think you have a form issue with any of your lifts, then pick up <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=312&amp;action=show_detail">Starting Strength</a> and figure out what that might be. There are plenty of videos on Rip’s <a href="http://www.startingstrength.com/resources/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=129">Q&amp;A Board</a>. Find a coach if you can. Assuming you have done these things, you should know what you are doing wrong and may be able to cue it yourself. If you think your form is “pretty good” and your name is Skinny Guy, then you aren’t eating enough.</p>
<p>From now on, you guys are only allowed to ask for programming advice if you meet the following weight requirements:</p>
<p>5’7″ and taller: &gt;200 lbs.</p>
<p>5’3″ to 5’6″: &gt;185 lbs.</p>
<p>Under 5’3″: Submit an application to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdnuBoNd0WI">chased by Jarred Allen</a></p>
<p>If you have met the weight requirements, then you have done something difficult enough that you have learned not to bitch about your inadequacies and you have manned up. <strong>Ladies are always welcome to ask for advice, because that means you have at least considered getting strong, and this gets you a gold star.</strong></p>
<p>And since I know you are going to ask, Fat Guy, keep eating your protein and fat, but cut back your carbs. If you are Really Fat Guy, then you may want to try a drastic approach for a few weeks (no carbs at all). Oh, and I apologize to Fat Guy and Big Guy that we have to give Skinny Guy so much attention…he just doesn’t fucking listen.</p>

  <p>I was completely annoyed on the <a href="/?m=20091222">Letter of Intent Day</a> comments how a lot of you posted numbers that you wanted to hit in training as opposed to posting competition goals. The whole point of Gant’s post was to commit to competing — and barely any of you did that! Well, now I’m going to piss a lot of you off, because I have to inform you that You Are A Coward. Some times the truth hurts. Coward.</p>

<p>The other day I was talking to a cute gal, and she said that she was skeptical of competing because she was afraid of losing. She was just being honest in our conversation (perhaps she was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mTUmczVdik">opening up to me like a flower</a>?). In any case, I set her straight by informing her that competing isn’t only about winning, <em>especially</em> in your first try. She agreed, but it may have just been my charm.</p>
<p>In any case, avoiding competition makes you a yella-belly-coward. Gant, who has been in more competitions than Michael Jordan, gives great insight when he says that competing will help you learn about yourself. There is a reason that sport builds character, and this is probably the most enduring quality about competing.</p>
<p>A lack of competition is never a good thing. Our society likes to coddle people, and those people make it a habit to do very little for themselves. This concept becomes embedded deep in their primitive brain, and there is the expectancy of someone else to provide goods, services, and even money. This type of person becomes frightened into doing anything out of the ordinary and accomplishing things on their own. <strong>They get scared of taking risks</strong>.</p>
<p>Sport is an obnoxiously appropriate way to safely exercise your ability to put yourself out on the line and to risk <em>something</em>. Fearing failure is identical to being a failure.</p>
<p>Competing in sport forces you to experience things that you otherwise may not. In life, you may purposely place yourself in safe situations in which you can’t fail. People do this all of the time, but the most successful people in history didn’t become successful by being safe and conservative.</p>
<p>Sport and competition are not always rosy endeavors. I’ll remind you that I just bombed the piss out of my weightlifting meet on Saturday. I spent three months of hard training in preparation for that meet, and I failed in all of my goals. What, you think I’ll just give up because I don’t want to be embarrassed in front of a bunch of people at a meet again (and technically lots of people on the internet, since my life is sort of on display on this website)? I tell my trainees this all of the time: when shit goes wrong you figure out what variable is to blame, and fix it the next time it comes up.</p>

<p>And by the way, had I actually totaled at that meet, I would have been the 105 kg Texas State Champ…by default. I was the only open competitor. Stef held the distinction of being in first and last place in the women’s 53 kg class. Are you trying to tell me that there weren’t any 53 kg CrossFit girls living in Austin, TX that could have lifted in the meet?</p>
<p>People who like to call themselves CrossFitters are notoriously annoying for not competing in anything at all. They claim that they are competing while training, which is comical. Sure, there are some who actually compete — I mentioned yesterday that Dutch had brought some people to the meet, and this is good. However, plenty of “CrossFitters” love to claim the status of being an “elite athlete” while not even participating in any kind of sanctioned competition (even though the CF creed states something like “regularly learn and play new sports”). It just doesn’t sound intelligent to claim that you will beat everyone at their own sport when you don’t even partake, that’s all. It seems that the fear of risk and failure permeates us all.</p>
<p>And that is the point. Look, if you aren’t a collegiate or pro athlete, you already know you aren’t the best in the world. Especially if you are older than 30 years old — you aren’t suddenly gonna become awesome in something. Intuitively you know that you are, at best, mediocre in the grand scheme of things (unless you try and invent your own sport, which is silly). Suddenly you realize that the thing that you fear the most is taking a risk into the unknown.</p>
<p>I want you to compete, because you will be better off after doing it. Most of you will not do exceptionally well in your first time, and this is <em>supposed</em> to happen. A virgin ain’t no Casanova, okay? Think very carefully in what you want to compete in this year. If you are on 70’s Big, then you are strength training. This not only prepares you, but gives you direction in what you could try competing in first. Go ahead, click on the comments, and make yourself accountable to taking a risk. Or you could just be a coward.</p>
<p>You’ll thank me later.</p>

  <p>The San Diego Chargers’kicker Nate Kaeding and I have two things in common: we are both ugly and we both didn’t perform very well this past weekend. The difference is that Kaeding is a Pro Bowler, and I’m just some jackass.</p>
<p>There were a lot of set backs in the month right before the meet. After hitting 127.5/165 in one training session in early December, I had a programming issue, a training break to travel for Christmas, got sick the next week, and then tweaked something in my shoulder the week before the meet (which I believe was unrelated to lifting). The shoulder issue didn’t seem serious and seemed to hold up Tuesday when I worked up to my openers and Thursday when I worked up to my last warm-up.</p>
<p>I felt it slightly as I warmed up on snatch on Saturday, and opened with what felt like a solid 125 (a meet PR). I don’t remember if I felt my shoulder during the lift, but I could feel it afterwords. Things went down hill from there. I felt pain on my second attempt at 130, and the shoulder seemed to not lock out and I missed it behind. In the warm-up room I could feel pain in my shoulder as I externally rotated with my elbow raised (imitating the snatch). I’m pretty sure that in an attempt to avoid that range of motion I looped the final attempt at 130, sort of racked it yet left the bar out in front, lurched forward to save it only to have my left knee hit the platform (which nulls the lift) and dropped it.</p>
<p>The clean and jerk continued to be disaster. I felt fine on my warm-ups until the last warm-up. It felt like my shoulder couldn’t shrug up to lock the weight over head, and I was lopsided, yet stood up with it. The weight I would fail on for three attempts was 155, 10 kilos below my PR, and something that I easily did earlier in the week. This was weird since I couldn’t actually feel my shoulder hurt like it did in the snatch — it felt like it didn’t work. I proceeded to miss the last two jerks, which was embarrassing.</p>
<p>As much as I don’t want the injury thing to be an excuse, it must have been an issue since it seemed that shoulder did not operate like it normally did. Perhaps it was my lack of experience in lifting with a shoulder issue — I don’t know. I went 1 for 6, didn’t total, thus didn’t win anything (I was the only open 105 kg lifter), didn’t qualify for nationals (287 kg total), and didn’t total 300 kg — which had been my goal for three months. It’s particularly frustrating to train very hard and fail miserably in every aspect.</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="http://www.dutchlowy.com/blog/">Dutch Lowy</a>, who was handling some of his lifters at the meet. He helped load my bar for me during the warm-ups so I didn’t have to waste any energy.</p>
<p>The good that came out of the meet is that some of our lifters did well. Colton, a 14 year old 77 kg lifter (you may remember his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px-JVpP3YqM">deadlift video</a> a few months back), went 6 for 6 and a 111 kg total after training the lifts for two injury riddled months. Alicia, who joined the gym when I first arrived here, went 5 for 6 with a 85 kg total after I convinced her to do the meet and start learning the lifts 5 weeks ago. Kyle, a 15 year old lifter snatched 75 (meet PR by 5 kilos), and a technicality prevented him from a meet PR 90 kilo clean and jerk (he dropped the bar before the “down” command), and finished with 75/85 for a 160 total (meet PR). My friend Brent, an 85 kg lifter, went 4 for 6 and had meet PR’s of 101/125, and thus a meet PR total at 226. Stef made weight (a chore), totaled, but didn’t have a great meet after barely surviving the bubonic plague that went around Wichita Falls recently.</p>
<p>I got a lot of experience handling lifters at a meet as well as watching Rip do the same. I have a lot of work to do in order to be better prepared for the next meet. First order of business is gaining 15 or 17 pounds…I only weighed in at 100.2 kg (at one point I was 228, down to 220 after being sick, then 224 on the gym scale before leaving for the meet). Despicable.</p>
<p>And for the few of you guys who showed up to watch the meet, I hope you enjoyed yourselves. Sorry if you had wanted to hang out a bit more. I wasn’t delighted by my performance, or lack thereof, and we had to get back to Wichita Falls in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>Rip has said that we plan to have two weightlifting meets at our gym this year: one in the first quarter, and one in the third quarter. Start making plans to lift now. More on this later.</p>
