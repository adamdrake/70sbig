<p>The shake consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>2 cups of milk</li>
<li>2 cups of ice cream</li>
<li>1/2 cup of peanut butter</li>
<li>2 scoops of protein powder</li>
<li>4 tablespoons of chocolate syrup</li>
</ol>
<p>Total Calories: ~2,090 kcal</p>
<p>Total Protein: ~104 g</p>
<p>The 70’s Big Shake is no different than every caloric bomb that guys have been making since blenders were invented. The shake is a good weight gain tool, a good recovery drink, and a good “make up meal” in the event you haven’t eaten in a while. The only reason I actually included ingredient amounts is because A) I know some of you goobers are going to ask anyway, and B) I wanted to give some hard facts on calories and protein (I know one of you will post how many carbs and fat are in it too). Measuring your food is typically a waste of time, especially when you need to gain 50 pounds. So please, don’t waste your time with measuring any of this.</p>
<p>To prepare the 70’s Big Shake:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pour a generous amount of milk into your blender. If you pour too much, you won’t have room for the other goodies, so be wary.</li>
<li>Scoop in a hearty amount of ice cream. If you have “reduced fat” ice cream, pleas click the x in the top right of your browser.</li>
<li>Take the spoon you used to scoop the ice cream, and dig the biggest wad (equivalent to WOD) you can out of your peanut butter jar. It is a sin to waste peanut butter.</li>
<li>Add two scoops of cheap whey protein powder</li>
<li>Hold your chocolate syrup bottle over the mixture and squeeze until satisfied. Then squeeze for another full second.</li>
<li>Blend, enjoy, and grow stronger</li>
</ol>

<p>“Nobody should be training if they haven’t had any coffee.”</p>
<p>This was an important lesson I learned from Rip many months ago. A warm cup of joe can rejuvenate your mood, warm your loins, and give you a convenient caffeine energy boost.</p>
<p>In order to be useful, your coffee needs to be bold…like your attitude. And America. And my pal Spence, a fighter pilot who grows stronger to battle G-tolerance and enemies who defy him in the air.</p>

<p>Coffee gives you an extra kick when your mind and body feel tired. In fact, sometimes it’s the only thing that can get you prepped for the stress you are about to impart on your body. You can’t get this done with Folgers; you need something dark enough to produce the kick. Caffeine pills can’t accomplish the same thing either; it must have something to do with the the powerful aroma and the boiling liquid coating your belly. Most problems that occur in training are usually correlated with a lack of coffee.</p>

<p>It is the night after our barbell seminar in Wichita Falls, and we are all a bit burned out. 20 hours of material will do that to you. There were a lot of great people at the seminar, and I hope to see most of them again (I demanded that a few of them make a return soon). If any of you who attended are reading this, feel free to give your thoughts on the seminar.</p>
<p>On Friday, someone from JP’s gym posted a link from his <a href="http://greyskullelite.com/">website</a>. It is written by one of his female trainees, and can not only give us dudes an insight on female training, but can also be an interesting read for the ladies. The article can be found <a href="http://greyskullarticles.blogspot.com/2009/12/its-process-part-1.html">here</a>, and here is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Armed with the confidence that only strength can bring, I ate with reckless abandon. I immediately blew past my previous sticking points and hit PR, after PR, after PR… a 50-pound deadlift PR instills confidence in the milk like nothing else! About six weeks into this “gaining” cycle, I competed in my first powerlifting meet. With my first official lifts under my belt, I paused to take in the moment. I was in awe of the progress I””d made in such a relatively small period of time, and I recognized that without the simple dietary additions of milk and meat, this rate of strength gain would not have been possible. I had arrived at a much-awaited turning point. The realization that my new found strength was the result of a carefully executed strategy allowed me, for the first time in a long time, to believe I was capable of changing my body. I had successfully escaped my obsession with body image and in the process, managed to reverse the longstanding misconception that I””m stuck with my body as it is. Confident and inspired, I was ready to take my training to the next level. Or so I thought…</p>

<p>Here is a video of my pal Brian who I have been training for a few months. Brian is on the weightlifting team, and will either lift in the 94 or 105 kg class (he was about 205 when he started, now he is accidentally 216, so we have to figure it out before the meet in January). I have Brian on a linear progression type program that includes the Olympic lifts, so he squats twice a week. Recently he started practicing football twice a week for a “semi-pro” football team (or whatever you call it, Brian). In other words, he is doing two strength workouts, two weightlifting workouts, and two practices a week, and still making progress. Friday he squatted 495x5x3, and here is a video of the third set:</p>

<p>PR Friday, people! This is where you will post the week’s accomplishments in lifting, eating, or gaining body weight. If you lift over the weekend, write your PR’s here anyway (as opposed to Monday’s post).</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>On the back-end of this website, I am able to go in and see who is linking to us. We’ve been linked to from a lot of places; from Washington state to Europe. 70’s Big makes an appearance on a lot of forums and it’s kinda funny to see the random criticism for the site, because usually it doesn’t make much sense.</p>
<p>The biggest misconception is that we are claiming that you eat an asinine amount of food for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! ARRGGGHHHHH! Look, <strong>there is no 70’s Big diet</strong>. The main thing we are concerned about is that you are eating enough to sustain getting stronger and bigger for your training goals, and we hope that those goals include some kind of competition.</p>
<p>It just so happens to be that the majority of people who are reading this site need to gain around 50 pounds of body weight just to be useful. Guys and girls like this — yes, lots of girls are underweight, albeit not 50 pounds underweight — need to get lots of calories in along with the mandatory protein. Will they gain a little bit of bodyfat? Potentially, but usually it is insignificant if they are training hard.</p>
<p>I am going to say this really obnoxiously because everyone always misses this important fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOBODY IS SUGGESTING THAT YOU EAT A BAG OF TRAIL MIX, ICE CREAM WITH MAGIC SHELL, AN EXTRA LARGE PIZZA TOPPED WITH OLIVE OIL, AND EGG NOG FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I AM suggesting that you do this if you need to gain muscular body weight, and I AM saying that you need to do this if you are skinny and want to get stronger. Once you achieve an appropriate weight, then you will eat to maintain that mass while fueling your recovery. Quit misconstruing what I say or what this site stands for. I just want you strong, and if you are small, you need to do things in order to get bigger and stronger.</p>
<p>Bigger guys (230+) can probably get away with a Paleo-type diet that includes milk and dairy. Bigger guys will require lots more food to meet protein and caloric requirements, and even more so when they are lifting lots of weight on a regular basis. You people that don’t strength train have to understand that the nutritional requirements change when you are placing a lot of stress on your body. Things don’t affect you in the same way that they do when you are an “exerciser” or a lazy person.</p>
<p>70’s Big is most inspiring to the skinny kid who needs a kick in the ass to eat like a 220 pound guy would instead of a 150 pound child. But this website also serves anybody who is wanting to get stronger. The fact is that everybody has a unique situation, but we are all the same in that we want to be stronger today than we were yesterday. There are no absolutes but getting stronger.</p>

<p>Since we are talking about it, here is a food plan that I made for my buddy Cliff to help him push from 200 to 220. Cliff weighed around 175 when he started lifting here, and got up to 220 while working a full time job. He figures he will make a push to 240 after the city league basketball season. This picture appeared a few months ago, and I consider it a classic.</p>

<p>Note: I made a mistake with what I refer to as the <a href="/?p=908">Facebook Fiasco</a>. I stated that I wanted you guys to identify yourselves if you want friendship on Facebook, and then I got a stupid amount of friend requests. I’ve since decided that I won’t be accepting any of this fubar unless I actually know you. Sorry, but it makes things easier to manage, and it ensures that I won’t A) be murdered in the middle of the night or B) subject to awkward bromances. Females are still welcome.</p>

<p>“Why not? I’m a Terminator.”</p>
<p>At 70’s Big I have always encouraged people to compete in something so that training can be pinpointed to a goal. Competing is a lot of fun, it makes training more interested, and it gives you more of a sense of purpose than just exercising (which is what you do if you say, “I just want to get better at everything, tee hee!”).</p>
<p>Well, if you ever were interested in competing in the barbell sports (powerlifting or weightlifting), then you better get acquainted with the rules.</p>
<p>USA Powerlifting (<a href="http://www.usapowerlifting.com/index.shtml" target="_blank">USAPL</a>) is a member of the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF). Their rule book is found <a href="http://usapowerlifting.com/lifterscorner/USAPLHandbook2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>USA Weightlifting (<a href="http://weightlifting.teamusa.org/" target="_blank">USAW</a>) is a member of the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF). Their rule book is found <a href="http://weightlifting.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/4688/USAW_TECHNICAL__DOPING_RULES_as_of_November_2008.doc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to become acquainted with the rules so that you don’t have a booboo in a meet. Kinda like Jacob did on his third attempt squat…</p>
<p>Nevertheless, nice job, Jacob. I will let him recap the meet in the comments.</p>

<p>I got an e-mail from someone asking me to do a favor. They wanted me to talk about love today. I’m a nice guy so I agreed, and now I have to pull something out of my ass.</p>
<p>I’ve always considered love to be one of those things that is necessary for happiness. That could mean the love of doing, the love of things, or the love for someone — all of that shit. I’m probably one of those people who will be happiest being in love with someone while doing the things that I love — and the same probably goes for most people.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty big deal if you can find someone that not only has all of the qualities you would look for, but also when that person loves you in return. For example, if you are a guy named Craig, then you might be in the midst of having a really happy anniversary with your lovely wife, Dana. That’s right, Craig, your wife loves you so much that she weasled her way into having me write about love today.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t believe in luck or anything like that, but I wonder what kind of shit Craig pulled to find himself in a situation with a caring wife like Dana. You’re a lucky guy, Craig; you’ve got a woman who cares about you and hearts guys that are 70’s Big. Must be nice.</p>
<p>You two love birds have a good anniversary, ya hear?</p>

<p>Look, I don’t have much time to post right now, so lets get some basic stuff taken care of.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are going to send me a friend request on Facebook, and are a guy,  give me the courtesy of identifying your purpose of doing so. In other words, I don’t like getting friend requests from creepy dudes that live in Montana.</li>
<li><strong>Edit: This did not say “every dude on here needs to send me a friend request today”.</strong></li>
<li>If you are a girl, you have the green light. Please.</li>
<li>The reason that whenever you type a single right quote mark (’) into the comments and it turns into a double quote mark is because there is some kind of coding error on our server. We called the people that run it, and they are unable to do anything about it. Some people have offered to look at the issue, but we’re just living with it for now.</li>
<li>If you want to type a single right quote into the comments section, then you can paste “’” without the quotes and space. That whole text sequence is going to be the HTML code for the ’.</li>
<li>Lastly, <a href="http://StartingStrength.com">http://StartingStrength.com</a> has published a couple of articles lately that may be pertinent to your training or knowledge thereof. So far, Mark Rippetoe is the only author, but there will be more articles by VIP’s. Stay tuned. <a href="http://startingstrength.com/index.php/site/resources/" target="_blank">You can read the articles here</a>.</li>

  <h2 id="8220was-it-over-when-the-germans-bombed-pearl-harbor8221">“Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?”</h2>
<p>When I first moved to Wichita Falls, I weighed 195 pounds. I began the linear progression, and ate a lot of food. I ate six eggs every morning, beef quesadillas, a gallon of milk a day, and lots of other stuff. For two or three months I ate those six eggs. It started to get monotonous, so I started trying to put things on them to mask the taste. I tried at least five different kinds of salsa. All were good (I’m in Texas, after all), but each one would turn bland after the second bottle.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before I started to loathe eggs. It became a struggle to wolf them down every morning. Soon, I hated them. Despised them. I couldn’t have them in my mouth because trying to swallow them nearly produced a gag reflex. That was the damndest thing ever; I had been eating at least three or four eggs every day for the past three years, and now they were suddenly becoming grotesque.</p>
<p>This has happened periodically with food throughout this year. It’s natural to start disliking something because it is repetitive and monotonous. In fact, my friends Chris and AC have both become jaded with eggs too. In my case, I had to start eating something else. For a while I just ate cheeseburger patties for breakfast (with barbecue sauce). I started eating eggs again a few months later, but always with bacon.</p>
<p>Weird set backs are going to happen when you are strength training. You might start hating food that you have always loved. Whatever. Just make a change and keep eating.</p>

<p>Oh, and just so you guys know, my abs are still sore (on Sunday) from front squatting and rack pulls on Friday night. With my belt. Because it makes my abs go to sleep.</p>

<p>–Douglas Adams</p>
<p>Like every Friday, it is PR Friday. Post this week’s PR’s to the comments. Remember that you can PR in lifting, eating, and gaining bodyweight. I clean and jerked 155 kg for the first time on Monday and squatted 465x5x3 on Tuesday. My program needs to be carefully tweaked because I am wandering into the realm of a slight overtraining. I snatched 120 (previous meet PR) Thursday on a very tired back and set of shoulders. Those body parts didn’t have any steam, and I missed 125 twice.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>Yesterday I talked about what goes on physiologically when a belt is worn during lifting. This process is very different than wearing other gear, like a squat suit or knee wraps. The suit and/or wraps aid the movement of a particular joint while the belt improves the stability and strength of the trunk. This is a very important distinction, and is the reason why powerlifting is separated into raw and equipped divisions and/or federations.</p>
<p>Before addressing other belt related topics, I want to make a bold, clarifying statement. <strong>If your goal is to get stronger (and you have been lifting longer than two months) and you <em>refuse</em> to wear a belt, you are a fucking idiot.</strong> I’m sorry I’m not sorry. Look, not only are the abdominals working harder, but the pressure is increased within the trunk which stabilizes and strengthens the spine. This makes you stronger, and it is usable strength. The first time someone wears their belt in a serious training session (especially when pressing and deadlifting), their abs get sore. Not to mention the work sets are handled easier than without the belt. The belt is not something that you use to “bust out of a training rut”, it is a tool that you use to get stronger, and if you aren’t wearing one, then you aren’t serious about your training.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of belt should I use?</strong></p>
<p>When you are experienced wearing belts, you will probably use a different belt depending on the exercise. However, in general, your belt will have the same width all the way around since the most important articulation with your body happens in the front on the abdominals. Most of us will use belts that are four inches wide, yet some of you with short torsos will need to have three inch belts (you will know this if the four inch belt is jabbing into your lower rib(s)). If a belt is more narrow in the front than in the back, then (as Rippetoe famously said in his book) the manufacturers don’t know how the belt works.</p>
<p>If you are in the market for a belt, then check out <a href="http://www.elitefts.com/">EliteFTS</a>. I don’t have any kind of monetary relationship with EliteFTS (shit, I don’t get paid to type anything), nor have I ever met Dave Tate or Jim Wendler (although I hear they are good guys from close friends), but they have really fucking good products, especially the belts.</p>
<p>I use one of the <a href="http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?m=PD&amp;cid=114&amp;pid=1378">Retro Series Power Belts</a> that Rip gave to me. I love it. Every PR I have had in the squat and press occurred with that belt around my waist (notables are pressing 205x5x5, squatting 500 for 5 singles, squatting 485×5, and squatting 465x5x3 in the linear progression). The Retro Series is 10 to 11 mm thick, which is thinner than the <a href="http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?m=PD&amp;cid=114&amp;pid=1021">Power Belt</a> that is between 12 and 13 mm. Both style of belts are completely customizable; length, thickness (depending on the series), one or two prongs, and color. All of the belts are high quality suede with smooth roller buckles — I couldn’t comprehend any other brand of belt being better than the EFS line.</p>
<p>The only drawback with these belts (including the Retro series), is that they may be a bit thick for some people to get in a good pulling position with. In such a case, you could always use a thinner leather belt (pictured below). A suede or leather belt is probably too big to use for the Olympic lifts and we (at the <a href="http://wfac-gym.com">WFAC</a>) like to use regular velcro belts (pictured below). The brand is Harbinger and they are sold here in town at Academy Sports.</p>

    L to R: suede, velcro, and leather belts
  </p>
</div>
<p>Pictured above are the belts that I will use depending on what lift I am doing. The suede belt is and EFS Retro Series suede belt that I squat and press in. The one in the middle is the velcro belt that I use when I clean and jerk (it’s actually Rip’s belt), and the one on the right is one of the many leather belts hanging on the wall in the gym that I will use when I am pulling (rack pull, haltings, deadlift etc.).</p>
<p><strong>How do I learn how to wear a belt and where is it worn?</strong></p>
<p>A belt should be worn on the last few warm-up sets before the work set(s), and it is best to learn how to wear one while squatting first. If it is thrown on at the work set, the body won’t be used to it being there and it will probably feel a bit weird (especially if it is your first time). When you are on your last couple warm-up sets, put the belt on so that it sits above your anterior superior iliac spine, or your hip bone. The top of the belt should not press against the last rib; I have seen someone bust up their costal cartilage wearing it here.</p>
<p>Tighten the belt so that it is moderately tight. Note that this does not read “as tight as you can fucking make it”. Just tight enough so that your abs press into it a bit. Do the warm-up set as normal. If the belt is sliding around during the set, then it is probably too loose. When you get to your work set, you may opt to keep it at the same hole, or you may want to tighten it by one more hole. The main consideration is that you don’t want to wear the belt too tight. If you have to “squeeze up” into the belt, then it is too tight and this will be counter-productive for the set. However, you may have to use an external object to help you tighten the belt appropriately; we use the edge of our power racks to hold the end of the belt against with our hands as we turn our bodies to the side — most people do this.</p>
<p>The more you wear the belt, the more you understand how tight you need it to be. If you slip your fingers into the crease between the upper portion of the belt and your abdominals, then it should be snug. If you can’t even get your fingers in the crease, then it is probably too tight. I keep trying to clarify belt tightness because I know some of you are going to freak out and not know if you have the belt on correctly. Trust me, you’ll figure it out over time. As a general rule, a more experienced belt wearer can wear their belt tighter, and they will intuitively know what is “too tight”.</p>
<p>The belt is worn in the same place for the squat and press, yet the deadlift may dictate a different placement. Rip likes to wear a thinner belt (like the leather one pictured above) lower in the front and higher in the back. I will have AC and Chris comment on how they like to wear their belts since Chris can deadlift over 600 and AC pulled 569 at his meet a few weeks ago. When I clean and jerk, I wear the velcro belt in the same way that I wear the suede belt for squatting/pressing. I can’t wear a belt when I snatch, because the bar routinely hits the belt after I hit my belly in the jump (I have a pretty vertical bar path). I have worn the velcro belt when bench pressing before (because of mild to moderate lumbar issues because of a car accident, it helped my back when I arched it while benching). Typically the belt is tightened when lying down instead of standing up before bench pressing.</p>
<p>I have seen some people (via the interweb) wear their belt higher when pulling. For example, Konstantinovs, who is stronger than three week old piss, wears his belt at the halfway point between his sternum and hip bones. Get experienced with the belt before experimenting like this, because he is obviously a professional.</p>
<p><strong>I have x existing injury, should I be wearing a belt?</strong></p>
<p>Uh, yes. If you have any kind of low back injuries, then you should have started wearing a belt yesterday. The worst case scenario would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylolisthesis">spondylolisthesis</a>. People with this ordeal have the potential to be crippled by back extensions or reverse hypers, but can and should squat and deadlift in order to keep the structures of their spine intact. They absolutely should be wearing a belt since we learned yesterday how it supports and strengthens the spine. I have worked with many people that have had bulging discs (I think I have one in my neck) in their lumbar spine, and it would behoove these people to get their low back strong by squatting and deadlifting — with a belt of course.</p>
<p>Most of this information is available in <em><a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=312&amp;action=show_detail">Starting Strength</a></em>. I learned how to wear a belt from Rip, and have taught many people to do so based on that lesson as well as my experiences. I am sure that there may be some differences in powerlifting or strongman competitions, and I admit that I am inexperienced in these matters. However, for general strength training purposes, the belt will be worn as described here.</p>
<p>Here is a video of Konstantinovs pulling 939 completely raw. Ask him if he could have gotten that strong without wearing a belt.</p>
