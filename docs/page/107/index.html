<p>If I had to guess, there has been a sharp increase in the number of people that strength train in the past few years. The majority of these people have limited experience with getting stronger. Compound this with all of the new experts in the “functional fitness” community, and you have a lot of misconception on what methods, exercises, and equipment would best be used to get stronger. One of the more irritating topics is whether or not to wear a belt.</p>
<p>It is basic knowledge among strong people that a belt makes you stronger, but the exact mechanism that accomplishes this is not well known. However, the “functional fitness” community likes to make outrageous claims and fairy tails to not wear a belt. We won’t be addressing any of them here; it isn’t worth acknowledging illogical rubbish.</p>
<p>To understand why a belt works, we must understand what is occurring physiologically during a heavy lift. If you have been taught correctly, then you already take a big, deep breath and hold it throughout the lift. This big breath of air increases the intra-thoracic pressure and subsequently the intra-abdominal pressure. This pressure acts like a pneumatic brace against the anterior portion of the spine while the erectors of the back brace it from the posterior. This increases the support of the spine, and more support means more strength.</p>
<p>The belt’s purpose is to constrict the abdominals to give them something to contract against. This contraction of the abdominals with an appropriately tightened belt is like trying to increase the volume in a non-expansible container — it increases the pressure even more. Not only is it helping to increase the intra-abdominal and thoracic pressure more than without the belt, but the abdominals also contract harder into the belt to do so. More pressure is more support which means more strength to do the task at hand.</p>

<p>The belt will allow heavier weights to be handled, and then heavier weights can be handled un-belted too — more than if you had not worn the belt to begin with. In other words, it makes you stronger whether you want to believe it or not. If a lifter chooses not to wear a belt while knowing this, then they are choosing to not allow their trunk to become as strong as it could. In other words, anybody who is serious about getting stronger will wear one.</p>
<p>I was having this conversation with two lifters at the gym yesterday, and after explaining the belt’s purpose, I said, “So, just wear the fucking belt, ok? Please?” It would be silly not to (especially because our gym has lots of them hanging on the wall).</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will talk about where to buy belts, what to look for, and how to learn how to start wearing one on your own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dude – killer website. I enjoy all the humor and content…great for motivation on slow days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do have a question though: I’ve always had really bad knees. My father and grandfather have both had knee surgery to repair bad knees. After trying crossfit and barely being able to walk after some wods (double unders, box jumps, etc really kill the knees), I went to the doc to get x-rays, and I pretty much have no cartilage in my knee joints and have bad tendinitis of the patellae tendon. I don’t want to give up though as I think building more strength in the hamstrings and quads will really help my knee stability and keep my knees from hurting so bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you had any clients with issues like this? What type of stretching or exercises would you have them do before or after a squat day to help the knee rehab a bit more and keep them lifting without having to take days off for the knee to recover?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>–Joey</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve responded to Joey, but I thought the topic was worthy of discussion. Here are a few points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The fact that Joey’s father and grandfather have bad knees is irrelevant. The development of the skeletal anatomy is primarily dependent on its mechanical environment. This means that it is an individualized thing, and thus the familial problems are coincidental.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing a bunch of ridiculous things in a conditioning workout when unadapted can yield some problematic consequences. Be aware of this if you are training/coaching others, or if you are trying stuff out on your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lack of cartilage is not something I would classify in the category “awesome”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Joey learns how to squat with the method that <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=312&amp;action=show_detail">we teach</a>, then his pain may go away entirely. The squat, when done correctly, is a knee neutral exercise; the net anterior/posterior force acting on the knee is equal because the hamstrings pull back on the tibia (when hip driving) while the quadriceps pull anteriorly via the patellar tendon, patella, and patellar ligament to extend the knee. All of these structures are strengthened accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As far as the patellar tendonitis is concerned, it depends on where the tendonitis is. Stretching the quadriceps can help decrease any potential tendonitis above the patella, which is typically a symptom of letting the knees slide forward at the bottom of the squat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a limited amount of information on Joey, but his pain will probably go away if the structures adapt to the strength training. Assuming he has problems six weeks from now, many people have found that heating their knees prior to squatting helps warm them up for the ensuing activity. Many have also found that icing their knees after squatting does not really help much. This is probably due to tendons having poor vascularization, thus their lack of response to ice. But this all depends on what problem a particular person is experiencing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best stretches for the quadriceps are any that have the knee in complete flexion while the hip is in extension. Remember, the rectus femoris (one of the quadriceps) crosses both the knee joint and the hip joint. It extends the knee and flexes the hip, so reversing those movements will elongate the muscle belly. You can help extend your hip whether you are standing or kneeling by flexing the gluteals (or ass cheek) on the same side as the quadriceps you are trying to stretch. </ul>
While this summary is not comprehensive, hopefully it has helped Joey a little bit, helped anybody else that may have experienced a similar issue, or helped all you healthy people think about the complicated shit that goes on when you train.</p>

<p>Jim wants to know what you think about his breakfast. So much that he made a video.</p>

<p>I’d probably have some more eggnog and less milk, since it will have some more calories (albeit more filling). It depends on what your body can handle though. Send pictures or videos <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">here</a>. I can’t guarantee they will go up, but I’ll make an effort. The more creative you are, the better the chances.</p>

<p>Anybody know a good place to get singlets? I would prefer a red, white, and blue one so I can rock my socks and headband. I may or may not drape an American flag over my shoulders only to have my assistant delicately take it off prior to chalking up.</p>
<p>You see, I’m going for something like this:</p>

<p>Before I left the Seattle seminar, I informed Billy that he needed to weigh 240. He was 220 at the time. Well, he is on his way with his self-proclaimed “Feast Fest”.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a five egg omelet with bacon, sausage, and cheese, hash browns, toast, biscuits and sausage gravy, and three additional scrambled eggs. Billy brought his lunch pail, cause he’s goin’ to work.</p>

<p>Hey Justin,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been following the linear progression for about 2-3 months, and working on doing things right like in Mark Rippetoe’s book. I train at a “fitness gym” (because they have child care, but I hate the place). I’m 180lbs and 5’9″, not naturally strong. I am at 250 on squat (started around 200), 280 on dead lift (working on 300), and 130 on press ( started at 115). I’m not the strongest guy but I’m working on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other day I was going for a PR on deadlift and this guy yelled at me from across the room and tossed a 45 lbs weight at me. He went on and on about how he much he used to lift and that my weight was “chicken shit”. All this while he was doing leg presses. He told me I was an insult to people like him, tearing up his gym, and making too much noise. This is a guy who does curls inside the squat rack.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A few days later I was looking in my notebook to see what my work set was going to be he yells at me across the gym, “Hey you need me to sign off on that? Holy shit that’s a lot of weight. Man, you might need a spot!” This is while he and his friend were doing press with the smith machine by the way. All this has really discouraged me lately, because picking a fight would cost me my career in law enforcement. There is not a whole lot I can do but keep getting stronger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I tell you all this to say that it was really hard to ball my fist around a barbell and lift when I wanted to just walk out. I just wanted to thank you for making this website. I know a lot of posts are funny, but a lot of the posts put some fire in my ass to go lift in spite of idiots like him. So thanks, it really helps a lot. OK, I’m gonna go drink some milk.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>–Russell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting e-mail. I can’t believe that the guy in the gym would be that much of an asshole, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbNymZ7vqY">stranger things have happened</a>.</p>
<p>My suggestion to Russell: ignore that silly goon. Get your shit done, and get out. There is no sense in having any kind of altercation. Aside from potentially getting your ass beat (2 vs 1), it would allow yourself to fall into the douchebaggery that he exudes.</p>
<p>Which brings me to an important point that I have wanted to cover for a while. 70’s Big does not equate with cockiness. Any kind of “my penis is bigger” attitude quickly reduces you to a jackass. I don’t want a community that gives off an aura of superiority. I want us to have a community that is enthusiastic about the common goal of increasing strength and working hard to do it. Whether it is Russell, who is squatting 250, or a guy who squats 600, they are equally important to me. Who would want to stay in a community that belittles others?</p>
<p>This has, and always will be, a place to learn. I don’t get paid for any of this. On a daily basis I post on this site, I answer the questions of at least ten people via e-mail, and I go out of my way to help the people in our gym — all of it to make others work hard in order to get strong. I would hope that this supportive helpfulness resonates within this particular community.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson puts it much more eloquently:</p>
<h2 id="we-confide-in-our-strength-without-boasting-of-it-we-respect-that-of-others-without-fearing-it">“We confide in our strength without boasting of it; we respect that of others without fearing it.”</h2>

<p>I hope you all gained five pounds yesterday. This may be an abbreviated week for some of you, but it is still PR Friday nonetheless. At the very least you can detail your eating PR’s from yesterday.</p>
<p>Remember, these are the PR’s you set this week in lifting, eating, or gaining weight. If you’re a more advanced lifter, then you might just highlight your training week since PR’s will be less frequent.</p>
<p>As for me, I clean and jerked 150 twice on Tuesday (PR), squatted 460 for three sets of five on Wednesday, and failed on my last rep of pressing 210 for three sets of five (had never pressed this but will consider it a PR when completing all the sets). I weighed in at 226.5, which is the heaviest I have ever been — got a few more pounds to gain to get to the upper limit of my weight class. Oh, and yesterday I watched an abnormal amount of Battlestar Galactica.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>I have been coaching a 14 year old kid named Colton for a couple of months. He walked in as a quiet, 122 pound boy who had a decent bench press (he was repping 135). 35 pounds later he is a pretty strong 157 pound pain in the ass who will talk smack to the majority of people in the gym (although probably not up to <a href="http://greyskullelite.blogspot.com/">Greyskull</a> standards).</p>
<p>Colton has squatted 235 for three sets of five, pressed 110x5x3, and benches 165x5x3. He will compete at the state meet in January with us, and will be close to hitting the qualifying total for national level competitions in his age and weight class.</p>
<p>In the following video, he pulls 285 for a set of five. He could probably stand to keep the low back locked in the first few reps, but the last few reps are typical of a heavy set of five. Nice work nonetheless.</p>

  <h2 id="hi-mom">Hi, mom</h2>
<p>This is the day that we all have been waiting for. This is the day when <strong>everybody that you know</strong> will be building (yes, building) and eating lots of food. Thanksgiving is a 70’s Big holiday.</p>
<p>Everyone we know is going to be eating lots of food?!? And they are going to be giving away leftovers?!!? My friends, it is raining calories.</p>

<p>I know some of you bigger guys may be trying to reduce your carbohydrate intake for the sake of body composition, but I think we can all agree that you should exempt yourself from such annoyances today. Realistically speaking, everyone should do the same. The malnourished Zone Dieters need this day just as much as we do. It will let them feel human again.</p>
<p>Go forth on this day and eat comically massive amounts of food. Enjoy the company of your friends, but don’t let them get between you and the next plate of food.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I won’t be eating with my mom today since I am in Texas. Her Thanksgiving smörgåsbord (to use the term again) sets the standard for all 70’s Big meals. Nothing compares. Miss ya, Mom.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>Here is another video from the WFAC. On November 13th I squatted 485 for a set of 5. It was the intensity day on the Texas Method, and I think I could have driven the 5RM up to 500 had I not altered my program for an Olympic weightlifting emphasis. I intentionally did not edit this video so you can get an idea of what goes on before and after the set.</p>
<p>After I come out from under the bar, Rip tells me my stance was about an inch wide. The tendency to widen the stance is exacerbated by an increase in weight, and some times a lifter may have to think about keeping it more narrow than they would want it. My reps are kind of slow in the beginning, but they increase with speed as I use my bounce a little better. The knees click in on the fourth rep (which I felt), but the 5th rep looks pretty good, given the stance.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">you can send in your own training videos</a>.</p>

<p>“I simply gave (them) a nudge out of the door.”</p>
<p>Time to recap our trip to Huntington Beach, CA for a barbell seminar this past weekend.</p>
<p>On Friday night Welbourn had our little crew over for dinner. “Little crew” is ironic because Johnny Pain weighs over 240, my buddy Josh is 235, Rip is at or a bit below 225, and I am at least 225. Not to mention Welbourn is almost 6’6″, 300 pounds. I caught a little bit of hell for being “the runt of the group”.</p>

<p>JP and I usually have one thing on our mind during these seminars: food. It had been a few hours since we got into town (we went from the airport to the hotel, then to the gym, then to a store, then off to Welbourn’s), and I was seriously worried about JP’s well being. A guy who is trying to get yoked can’t go that long without eating; he was getting 90’s small before my eyes. I assured him that “Welbourn will make us a 70’s Big worthy meal, just you wait.” I tried to make myself believe it. Not for my sake, but for JP.</p>
<p>Welbourn delivered:</p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time I had met Welbourn, but the first time I got to hang around him for more than a few minutes. Aside from being a behemoth, he is both highly intelligent and damn funny. John told us some amusing stories from his time in the NFL and is friends with a lot of 70’s Big football players. You’ll here more about Welbourn in the coming weeks, especially if he keeps cooking like this:</p>

<p>The seminar itself went well. There was the usual collection of skinny fellas that need to gain &gt;30 pounds, and I hope we reached some of them. Matt, I hope to see you in Wichita Falls next summer. In the mean time, be a good boy and drink your milk.</p>
<p>There was someone at the seminar who was actually quite large. After about an hour into the lecture on Saturday morning, a giant walked in wearing all black, short shorts, and combat boots. He was probably 6””””””””””””””””5″, 265 (somebody verify this for me) with an estimated 12% bodyfat. The dude was huge. Pete bent down to fill out his registration, and I walked over, hit him on the shoulder and said, “What the hell are you doing here? You’re not a CrossFitter.” He looked at me and kinda laughed, but I was still genuinely curious. In any case, Pete was a large human being, and we later found out he plays rugby. He also had been eating a paleo type diet that unfortunately caused him to lose between 30 and 40 pounds — when you are that big, you are gonna have to eat something more than just “Paleo” to maintain get enough calories. In such a case, Welbourn recommends eating “Paleo” + milk. This should be substantial to maintain a given body mass, depending on the training.</p>
<p>Later that night (when Pete ordered two entrees at the restaurant), he was a bit malcontent about losing all of that muscle. I was glad to hear that he was on our side, because he can easily conquer several small villages.</p>
<p>JP and I were able to make a milk run to sustain our caloric needs during the (nearly) 10 hour-a-day seminar. Milk and eggnog did the trick.</p>

<p>In other news, I’m pretty confident that I convinced Sean and Ruth to compete in weightlifting. They both have comical amounts of potential in their athletic ability, and I can’t wait to hear about their competitive conquest. It’d be a shame to see that talent untapped, so hopefully I gave them a nudge out of the door.</p>

    We ate at Welbourn’s again on Sunday night, but we brought a smörgåsbord of stuff to eat from Trader Joes. After eating I was exhausted and some how managed to fall asleep on Welbourn’s couch when <a href="http://www.fandome.com/video/105135/Predator-Carl-Weathers-and-Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Handshake/">Predator</a> was on tv, so I missed out on a lot of good story tellin’. Oh well. Thanks for the hospitality, John.<br /> <br /> Well, it was another successful seminar. We always aim to educate and help as many people as we can. There is never enough time or space to mention everyone, but I’ll get a quick summary in:<br /> Pete, send me your e-mail and stay in touch. Julie (not the one pictured above), let me know how getting stronger improves your Olympic lifts, and good luck at your next meet. Thomas, get your boobs problem situated and continue getting strong (and start thinking about how you would program this stuff). To everyone else, implement this material into your practice, never stop learning (we won’t), and remember&#8230;you’re never strong enough.<br />

  <p>We got back late Monday night from doing a barbell seminar in Huntington Beach, CA. I would not advise anyone visiting or continuing to live in that state. To California residents: I’m sorry I’m not sorry. More on the trip tomorrow…</p>
<p>You may remember that on Friday, I mentioned that AC was going to compete in a USAPL meet. He did 70’s Big justice going 7 for 9, and I’m proud of him.</p>
<p>Competing in the 220 lb class…</p>
<p>Body weight: 204 (on their scale, he was around 208-209 on his scale)</p>
<p>Squat: 529 (raw state record)</p>
<p>Bench: 368 (raw state record</p>
<p>Deadlift: 568</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7763895">AC’s Powerlifting Meet</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user802431">A.C.</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p><em>Edit: AC went 7 of 9. I typed it wrong last night for some reason. I was in a hurry.</em></p>

  <h2 id="8220i-train-every-day-of-my-life-as-they-have-never-trained-a-day-in-theirs"><strong>“I train every day of my life as they have never trained a day in theirs.”</strong></h2>

</br>
<p>Justin is still out at the barbell cert, and we don’t have AC’s video yet. So we’re going to take a little time to consider the merits of weight class athletes in the world of 70’s Big.</p>
</br>
<p>Moving the iron is all well and good, but I personally cannot think of a more useful application of strength and power than tossing another human around. And nobody tossed humans around better than today’s subject.</p>
</br>
<p>Alexander Karelin is one of the greatest <del>wrestlers of his generation</del> athletes of all time. Karelin was a superheavyweight Greco-Roman wrestler that represented the old Soviet Union and, later, Russia. <strong>The Russian Bear went undefeated for 13 years in international competition, including a six-year stint where he didn’t give up a single point</strong>. Over this period he won 12 European Championships, nine world championships, three Olympic golds, and one Olympic silver (his last match was a loss in the finals). And lest we forget, at 6’3 290, he was definitely 70’s Big.</p>
</br>
<p>Greco-Roman differs from other forms of wrestling because all the action happens above the waist. Grabbing, hooking, or tripping the legs is forbidden. As a result, the throws are often quite dramatic. Body slams and suplexes are commonplace in Greco-Roman.</p>
</br>
<p>You can get a feel for the setups by watching Karelin in this video:</p>
</br>
</br>
<p>Karelin wrestled at 130 kg, but he was impossibly fast and athletic. The big guys couldn”t keep up with him. No other wrestler matched his strength, either. Opponents were so scared of being slammed that many sprawled onto the mat (giving up dominant position and possibly points!) hoping to avoid being thrown for big points. Karelin countered this by applying his signature reverse body lift, which was a gutwrench suplex off the mat! This move affectionately became known as the <strong>Karelin Lift</strong>.</p>
</br>
<p>To put this into perspective, try to clean a 300 pound resisting object from the floor. Do this multiple times over three two-minute periods, and you get the idea. Still not clear? Here you go:</p>
</br>
</br>
<p>As is customary with dominant athletes, Karelin was accused of using performance enhancing drugs like HGH and steroids. Many referred to him as “The Experiment, “a not so-subtle dig at the U.S.S.R.’s tendency to dispense testosterone like it was candy. However, Karelin never failed a drug test his entire career (and Olympic drug tests actually have some teeth). When asked about these rumors, Karelin shrugged and said, “<strong>People cannot believe I am natural because I train every day of my life as they have never trained a day in theirs</strong>.”</p>

</br>
<p>Edit: If anybody has any factual training info on Karelin, please send it in. Most of the information on him is in Russian, and my Russian is quite poor. I have read claims of him doing a 420 pound clean and press. Supposedly Pavel remarked that Karelin did 440 pound Zercher deadlifts for a set of 10. That would be applicable to the Karelin lift, as you need your arms underneath your opponent (Karelin was blessed with very long arms). I have also seen a training clip of him running through waist-deep snow with a log on his back and rowing for hours. You know, stuff from Rocky IV.</p>

  <p>All right ladies and gents, post your weekly PR’s. I had a shitty-ass training week, and the only thing I really accomplished was squatting 455x5x3 on Tuesday. I’ll have to do my Friday workout on the road because we are going to Huntington Beach, CA for a seminar.</p>
<p>In other news, AC is competing in a USAPL meet tomorrow. I don’t believe in luck, but if you want to wish it to him, you can do so in the comments. He will compete in the 220 class and will probably post his openers and body weight here in a bit. AC claims to be making a video documentary of the meet, so we’ll see what happens. And AC; make me proud you little bastard.</p>
<p>Chris will compete in a meet soon as well. Here is a video of Chris from early September pulling 600 and 625 (with a bit o’ hitching).</p>
