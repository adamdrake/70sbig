  <h2 id="8220when-one-teaches-two-learn8221">“When one teaches, two learn.”</h2>
<p>–Robert Heinlein</p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with barbell training as it has been taught by Mark Rippetoe, whether learning it by attending the Basic Barbell seminar through CrossFit, reading his books, <em>Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training</em> and <em>Practical Programming for Strength Training</em>, that are published by <a href="http://aasgaardco.com/">The Aasgaard Company</a>, or viewing the media that has been available through CrossFit.com over the past few years.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the coaches, the Basic Barbell seminar has been expanded into the Starting Strength Seminar. This new seminar is longer and more detailed with a 3-day format that allows the attendee to gain a better, more thorough understanding of the biomechanical model of the exercises that operate in a gravitational framework, how to appropriately coach the basic barbell exercises, how to program these exercises into an effective strength and conditioning program, as well as learning and performing the exercises.</p>
<p>The SSS is an incredibly valuable learning experience that cannot be attained anywhere else in the fitness industry. The value is augmented by the new testing format that will include an evaluation on the ability to coach and perform the exercises as well as an online exam that can be taken after the seminar. Passing both the practical and written assessments will award the attendee with a Starting Strength Coach certificate as well as access to an online “coaches only” message board, being included in an online directory of barbell coaches to refer trainees to you, as well as instant access to the experienced staff of the SSS. Many will learn extensively from attending the seminar, but only the best will earn the certificate.</p>
<p>If you have ever been interested in coaching barbell training, this is a good place to start. The more coaches we have with their heads on straight, the better the strength and conditioning field will become. More information on the seminars can be found at <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=212">here</a>.

    Hi Chris
  </p>
</div>
<p>By now you have read about my training partner (and super friend), Chris. We did a bit of filming last Friday, and the video below consists of his training session. Chris’ “story” is important for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shoulder Injury</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In January Chris had pretty serious shoulder injury — we think he had some kind of tear in his supraspinatus. He could barely lift a 15 pound bar overhead. I started working with him, getting him to press that bar for more and more reps every day. Eventually he could do 3 sets of 25. Chris slowly increased the weight while titrating the reps down until he was able to do 3 sets of 5 for sets across. We did the same thing on the bench press, and eventually he worked up to being on a linear progression in both presses. At the end of his linear progression, he benched 317x5x3 and pressed 210x5x3. Not bad considering he started at zero.</p>

<li><strong>Bigger Guy on the Linear Progression</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When Chris started all of this, he was a pretty big guy at 6’ and 250 lbs. We talked multiple times about his diet early on, and it was made clear that he should eat plenty of <strong>eggs, meat, and milk and take it easy on the carbs</strong>. Larger guys don’t need extraneous calories, they need protein, and calories to fuel their training. Gant always says eat enough protein to maintain or increase your muscle mass, enough carbs to fuel your workout, and enough fat to recover. With strength training, you don’t need a whole lot of carbs if you aren’t trying to gain a lot of weight. Chris loves to grill, so he eats a LOT of meat and eggs. “They are the BAYST”, he says.</p>

    Chris and I drinking 70&rsquo;s Big shakes when we were skinnier
  </p>
</div>
<p>About 2 months ago, Chris and I were training and he was at the water fountain. When he walked by, his back looked massive. I said, “Dude, you’re lookin’ kinda big, how much do you weigh?”</p>
<p>“250, I think.”</p>
<p>“Well, go weigh yourself.”</p>
<p>He was 265 and didn’t even know it. 15 pounds of muscle in a few months time. I assure you, his girlfriend wasn’t complaining. (Fun fact: Chris’ girlfriend and sister were some of the original gals to be supportive of our 70’s Big idea early on.)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Groin Injury</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>During the linear progression, Chris got up to squatting around 450 for his work sets, but strained something in his lateral groin area (I think it was the sartorius). This kept him from squatting with a bar for at least a month and a half. The injury got a <em>little</em> better, so I had him start squatting with an empty bar while in pain. We went through the injury protocol, working up the weight, titrating the reps down. He got back up into the upper 300’s for his work sets, but he still felt some residual pain. So, instead, we moved his squat to the Texas Method. This injury was not due to a form problem, and so we experimented with the Texas Method (5×5 volume on Monday, light day on Wednesday, and 3RM intensity on Friday) to see if it would heal up with less weekly volume. It did; as you can see in the video, he squats 500 for a very easy triple.</p>

<li><strong>Natural Deadlifter</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When I started working with Chris on the linear progression, he pulled 445 for an easy set of five. From there, he made quick work of the deadlift (his favorite lift) by making 15 pound jumps up until 500. From there he made 10 pound jumps, then a few five pound jumps to finish with 545 for a set of 5 (the most he had ever pulled). A few weeks later he pulled 600 and 625 (with a slight hitch on the latter). Chris loves him some deadlift.</p>

  <h2 id="woah8230girls">Woah…girls</h2>
<p>I finally got a hold of a scanner the other day. This means that I can now post pictures from the hundreds of powerlifting magazines that Rip has held onto over the years.</p>
<p>We don’t really get an opportunity to talk about women on 70’s Big, so I’d like to highlight some women lifters from the 1981 Women’s National Powerlifting Championships. You’ll see that these women were not only strong, but pretty good lookin’ too. All the numbers from this meet are in kilograms (2.2 pounds = 1 kilogram). All of the following women won their respective weight classes. And “(WR)” denotes a world record.</p>

<p>Wanda Sander won the 82.5+ kg class with a 192.5 kg squat, 110 kg bench, and a 210 kg deadlift. Pretty strong.</p>
<p>I keep going back to the idea that these women are both real strong and attractive. There has always been a silly misconception that lifting weights will make women bulky, but they tend to forget they have one-tenth the testosterone of a male. Being “toned” means being strong, and being strong means you are probably gonna lasso a 70’s Big fella real soon. Once you go adult male (&gt;200 lbs.), you’ll never go back.</p>

<p>There are a lot of factors that dictate how well a training session can go: how rested you are, how much food has recently been eaten, how much coffee has been consumed, general stress levels, injuries or soreness, atmosphere or environment, attitude, and mood. One very underrated aspect to help improve some of those areas is a good training partner.</p>
<p>A good training partner is someone you get along with well, can help motivate you, critique you, and someone that genuinely cares about your success. The best partners meet all these qualities, and you do the same for them.</p>

<p>My training partner is one of my best friends, Chris. When I met him earlier this year, we got along pretty well right away. We like to joke around a lot in between sets, and this developed the concept that is 70’s Big. When we lifted, we were gettin’ 70’s Big. When we were eating, we were gettin’ 70’s Big.</p>
<p>Chris has gotten pretty damn strong in the time that I’ve known him. He has deadlifted 545 for five, pulled 600 and 625 for singles in the gym, and squatted 500 for a triple last Friday (video of this training session is forthcoming). He loves to deadlift, and whenever he is about to pull, I literally get goosebumps — and I’m only watching. Some of the most fun I’ve had in recent memory happened in the gym with this big galoot (he’s 6’, 265).</p>
<p>Fun is a keyword. Sometimes training can be hard — real fucking hard. So, having a break from the high stress of attempting heavy lifting can be a luxury. Chris and I can go from joking around to psyched up pretty quickly — I have an uncanny (almost stupid) ability to get my adrenaline up (more on this another time). Having a good friend, especially one who is real damn strong, makes training more fun than it already is.</p>
<p>Realistically all this rubbish is an excuse to play the following video. The camera was left on in a candid moment. The training partner topic was the only one that fit to let me post the video, otherwise it would be stuck on the cutting room floor. <em>Note: Unless your name is AC, you may not find this amusing.</em></p>
<p>Anybody have any stories about good training partners? Bad ones?</p>
<p>How many of you actually have training partners?</p>

<p>Drew from Alpharetta, GA sent me this picture of him deadlifting. Drew is 5’6″ and 170 lbs., up from 155 three months ago. In the photo he is pulling 380 for a set of five and has since done 400 for a triple. Drew is one of many people who formerly only did CrossFit and now training for general strength and power development.</p>

<p>The size of our audience is broad on 70’s Big. There are guys who are admittedly 90’s Small, and another guy requested a 4XL shirt the other day. There’s also some good lookin’ females sprinkled in the mix. However, the majority of guys who are strength training are underweight. And I have good news for these fellas.</p>
<p>The Holiday Season is upon us.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: if an average house wife accidentally gains 5 to 15 pounds during the holiday season, then I hope to god you little goobers can do a little better than that. Large holiday meals + succulent treats around the house + colder weather that keeps you indoors = tramping along the path to 70’s Big.</p>
<p>And here is your secret weapon in this venture:</p>

<p>Eggnog. Consider eggnog to be your Mjöllnir in these wintry months; smiting your enemy with terrible power. There is a whopping 210 calories in <strong>half of a cup</strong>. A half gallon of the stuff has 3360 calories and 80 grams of protein. That’s a thousand more calories than a gallon of milk with half of the volume, and there is more protein in eggnog compared with the same volume of milk. Don’t you see…THEY ARE GIVING CALORIES AWAY!</p>

<p>Quint (pictured above) squatted 300, pressed 165, and deadlifted 373 — all significant PR’s. And Quint is desperately working on filling out his shirt, so lay off of him. Nice work Quint, and nice work Primal Fitness for not only making lifting fun, but getting gals to wear some high socks.</p>

<p>We got most of everyone’s PR’s in our comments the other day. If you haven’t done that, you can post them today. However, Friday is now going to be known as PR Friday. Post the improvements you made throughout the week whether they be in weight lifted, reps, bodyweight increase, or eating PR’s. If you made some kind of improvement this week towards getting stronger or yoked, I wanna hear about it.</p>

<p>Today’s spotlight is on Arden Cogar, Jr., a Timbersports champion and a hell of a nice guy. He has been 70’s Big since, well, pretty much the seventies. He was 14 when he squeezed himself into a size 48 jacket. As an adult, he sports a 13.5 shoe and wears a size 13 ring (which would be a collar to most 90s small guys).</p>
<p>Arden has been a fixture on the professional lumberjack circuit for over 30 years. If you haven’t been watching manly programming (perhaps you’re 90s small and have been watching Glee), you might have missed ESPN’s Stihl Timbersports, a series of lumberjack events that challenge competitors to chop, cut, and saw their way through white pine as fast as they can.</p>
<p>To date, Arden has won 47 world titles in lumberjack sports, including the U.S. Stihl Timbersports Championships three times in the past four years. He is the current Captain of the U.S. National Lumberjack Team.</p>
<p>He came into this the old fashioned way, through his family. His 75 year old father, himself a legend in the sport, is a retired logger who spent over 50 years in the woods. Arden Sr. instilled a work ethic in his son that sticks with him today.</p>
<p>In addition to his dad, his four uncles participated in Timber Sports for many years, and they passed it on to their sons. Currently, there are over 20 members of the Cogar family who are active in some facet of Timber Sports.</p>

<p><strong><em>How long have you been competing in lumberjack sports?</em></strong></p>
<p>Last weekend I wrapped up my 31st year competing in professional lumberjack sports. I started at age 8 when my father put modified chain saws in my hands. I started chopping and sawing when I was 12. I became the youngest participant ever in ESPN’s Stihl Timbersports Series at age 17.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is your training background?</em></strong></p>
<p>I started lifting weights when I was 12. I competed in my first bench press contest when I was 14. I competed in my first three lift powerlifting contest when I was 17. I stopped power lifting when I realized I would have needed to turn to “the dark side” in order to remain competitive. For the next 14 years, I did “power bodybuilding” until I was introduced to Crossfit. I then started doing more “metabolic conditioning” workouts to make myself fitter and tougher. Through Crossfit I fell in love with the Olympic lifts. Through that love for the Olympic lifts, I was introduced to my current coach, Randy Hauer, who has completely revamped my entire training protocol.</p>
<p>Through Randy’s diligence, I’ve made more progress in the past two years (as a middle aged man), than I did in the previous 20. I’ve turned my event training sessions into my metabolic conditioning sessions and my weight training is now speed and speed strength based.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Before any of you Crossfitters think Arden is building off-season GPP by doing Fran, snatching PVC, or taking pictures of himself doing handstands in public, think again. Here is Arden’s idea of a conditioning workout:_</p>
<p><strong>BABE THE BLUE OX workout</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How has this change in training philosophy helped you?</em></strong></p>
<p>My weight training has gone from “grunting and getting hurt” as I settled into middle aged to “halfway grunting for a week, resting a week but still lifting; three quarters grunting for a week, resting a week but still lifting; 4/5’s grunting for a week, resting a week but still lifting, back to half way grunting.” Training this way has allowed me to make more progress in the past two years (at age 38 and 39) than I did the previous 20 years combined.</p>
<p>Moreover, Coach Randy has done the same sort of lay out with my event training, that keeps me chomping at the bit to train more than what he’s allotted for me. The heaviest times of the year are the Fall and Spring, but I only do what he says and it has kept my performances ever improving.</p>
<p>I love it. I’m totally looking forward to my 40s and I think the sky’s the limit.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you train for your sport?</em></strong></p>
<p>My training for Timber Sports events is sports specific. We have various disciplines in the sport that require use of the axe, the crosscut saw, and the chainsaw. I train those events as though I were doing them in competition. I do not however, use my best equipment when I train. I do try and simulate the events that I’m training for – in other words, If I am cutting a 12″ white pine at a contest and I estimate it will take me 16 hits and 15 seconds to cut the log – I will train the log to be cut in 16 hits and 15 seconds.</p>
<p>The volume of my training and the “perceived intensity” of my training varies depending upon the time of the year. When in my off season my volume is higher, but my “perceived intensity” is lower. When the season rolls around my perceived intensity increases as I get myself race ready; my volume of training drops somewhat. During the season, my perceived intensity is still high, but my overall volume of event work is limited.</p>
<p><em><strong>Numbers time. Any cool feats of strength you’d like to talk about?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m a natural puller. I could deadlift a lot of weight at a very young age. The most I’ve ever singled was 775 (I can do a lot more, but I have no interest in trying). Last Christmas I pulled 615 for 9. My goal is to do it for 10 this Christmas. I’ve back squatted well into the 600s. And, at 39, I can still dunk a volley ball; not bad considering I’m very under tall. I can also still do 20 consecutive dead hang pull ups with little or no effort (and never training them).</p>
<p><em><strong>You have recently started training the Olympic lifts. How are those going?</strong></em></p>
<p>Currently, my best squat clean is about 150 to 155 (but I can see that increasing quite a bit as my technique improves), my best power snatch is about 110 (I’m still mastering the squat snatch), my best overhead squat is about 140.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does one become a professional lumberjack?</em></strong></p>
<p>Getting involved in Timber Sports is an expensive endeavor. If a person is willing to invest the money in the equipment and the time into training, they can be very successful in the sport. The contests are all over the world and we have various levels of competition (novice, intermediate, professional and masters). There are also events completely and exclusively for women and younger athletes. The axes cost about $400 a piece; the crosscut saws cost about $1,500 a piece; and the modified chainsaws cost about $4,000 a piece. So it’s in expensive endeavor. But the contests offer prize money that can result, through diligence and training, enough placings to pay for the equipment and the costs of travel.</p>
<p>Right now, there is a big push on the collegiate level by Stihl which has resulted in a great influx of very good young competitors. Stihl has recently sponsored the Collegiate Timbersports Series which is aired on ESPN U. There are over 400 universities and colleges in the United States that have Forestry programs that have Forestry Clubs and Woodsmens’ Teams. These college lumberjacks or timber sports athletes are building the future of U.S. Timbersports.</p>
<p>For a person who’s not in college, the best way to learn about the sport is to contact someone such as myself or another professional. Most of us are very wiling to share what we know about the sport because we see it as a hobby that we want to preserve and share with the world. Tons of people have offered to pay me to train them and I’ve turned it down every time because it would take the fun of the sport for me. My father trained hundreds of competitors over the years. He told them everything he knew because he wanted them to beat him. He wanted them to make him work harder so he would become better. I live by the same adage.</p>
<p><strong><em>I’ve noticed that not all lumberjacks are 70s Big. What kind of physical skills do you need for this sport?</em></strong></p>
<p>The physical attributes for good Timber Sports athletes are all over the place. While physical size is a plus, it is not the true indication of success. My father was 5’7’ 200 pounds during his prime years in the sport. I’m not much taller at 5’11″. A lot of today’s top athletes are very tall and rangy. One of the best axemen in the world is 5’10″ and weighs 135 – or a little over 60 kilos. I weigh nearly twice as much as he does, yet he can drive an axe in as deeply as I can. I am much physically stronger, but his timing and technique is absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>The true test is perfecting technique while continuing to become stronger and more athletic. That is my challenge and one I hope to master in the upcoming years.</p>
<p><em><strong>What should the readers know about Timbersports?</strong></em></p>
<p>Timber Sports is a wonderful family oriented sport that has it’s roots in hard work and sweat. Many people who watch a Timber Sports event say, “wow, that looks like a lot of work.” Simply put, it is. It’s great fitness and a great event that celebrates a rich logging and lumbering history that is the basis for the infrastructure of what is today the United States.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thanks for talking with us. Any parting thoughts?</strong></em></p>
<p>To quote a good friend and 2006 World’s Strongest Man, Phil Pfister, – “Alls ya need to do to get strong is yer knee bendin’, yer bar liftin’, and yer bar pressin’.”</p>

<p>I decided that whenever we travel to do a barbell seminar that I can do my best to chronicle the event. Aside from the the seminar itself, these trips have a focus on eating, drinking, training, and taking in the scenery. Maybe in that order.</p>
<p>Washington state is lush with consistent rainfall, and the leaves are in the middle of melting into golden and pink flecks along the rolling landscape. Giant maple leafs litter the damp ground while douglas firs huddle with their Christmas tree cologne. Alders and ash, cedar and birch, hemlock and hawthorn, oaks and pines, willows and spruce…Fuck, that place was pretty.</p>

    Well, when we got into Seattle, two of the three bags we checked did not make the trip with us (mine was the one that made it). The belligerent airline employee had no reasoning for the delay, but I suspect this was the TSA&rsquo;s fault. They don&rsquo;t do anything but fuck things up anyway. The airline employee working the baggage claim area gave Rip some lip about <em>his</em> company losing Rip&rsquo;s bag. The exchange was mildly amusing if you weren&rsquo;t Rip or Stef. Why would anyone hold onto a job in which the sole purpose is to deal with people who are pissed off?

      <a href="http://crossfiteastside.com/">CrossFit Eastside</a> was the gym that was hosting the seminar. Mike Street and Carrie Klumpar co-own and coach at the gym. Unlike most silly CrossFit &#8220;gyms&#8221;, this one has some power racks, weightlifting platforms, an emphasis on barbell training, and coaches who are good at making people strong. If you live in the Bellevue and Redmond area and want to get strong, pay Mike and Carrie a visit.
    </p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;
    CF Eastside held a CrossFit Total meet (a powerlifting-type meet that includes a squat, standing overhead press, and a conventional non-sumo deadlift and follows a weightlifting meet format) on Friday night. I was the head judge while Rip announced the meet. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to see people get excited about getting strong and hitting PR&amp;rsquo;s in a meet.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;
      More importantly, on Friday and Saturday we went to a sub shop where I got a giant size (which had to have been 16 inches long) Philly cheese steak with double meat and double cheese. I&amp;rsquo;d estimate 1,500 to 2,000 calories in one of those bad boys. I thought it would give me detention with the commode later, but my digestive tract has experienced some sort of adaptation to this kind of thing. Sorry, no pictures of these beasts &amp;#8212; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thinking properly because I felt so famished. Famished = 90&amp;rsquo;s Small. That, my friends, is a dangerous thing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;
        In the seminar, we have a little friend named Mr. Thrifty who helps everyone learn skeletal and muscular anatomy. Mr. Thrifty lost an arm, and as a result, started hitting the bottle.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;

            There were a lot of interesting people at the seminar. My buddy Charlie marked himself on the first day with his choice of socks. Luckily he&amp;rsquo;s one cool dude. He&amp;rsquo;ll be trying out for a minor league basball team next May, so he should understand the importance of strength to do so. It should be easy &amp;#8212; he&amp;rsquo;s got one helluva mullet brewing.

              There are some other notables from the seminar. Billy is a strong fella who competed in the Total meet on Friday, went through the seminar, then trained again Monday night. If I remember correctly, he weighs a solid 220, and he&amp;rsquo;s got some 70&amp;rsquo;s Big potential. Billy: get to 240, quick.&lt;br /&gt; Then there&amp;rsquo;s my pal Anthony, who is 6&amp;rsquo;6&amp;#8243;, and somewhere around 180. I mention him because he is SUPPOSED to be going on a milk and meat fetish. Anthony: please gain 100 pounds. You will easily conquer small villages at this height and size. Again, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any pictures; cut me some slack because I didn&amp;rsquo;t decide to chronicle the weekend until Monday.
            &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;br /&gt; Street and Carrie had an anatomical model that was conveniently used to teach the relevant musculature in strength training. I just thought it was amusing because he had a removal penis.

Usually we leave on Monday, but we hung around to travel up north towards the Cascade Mountains. We stopped off in Sultan to go to the Sky River Meadery. Mead is an ancient honey wine that has been enjoyed by warriors and poets for ages. When we drank a bottle that night, Rip was disappointed that we lacked a horn to drink out of. Find yourself some mead and enjoy it like a viking (but make sure it is dry mead, the extra sweet flavors would be the equivalent to drinking Zima). After purchasing the mead, we wandered around a Skyhomish, a town that is more or less near the base of the Cascades. We got coffee several times, once in a stand run by a rather ravishing girl who asked if we wanted ice in our coffee to cool it down (weird). There were some interesting lawn ornaments around the parking lot, including this:

                                Rip, Stef, and I got out and started walking down a gravel road. Everything was still. The forest around us was incredibly dense and swallowed the sound waves that our blundering made. Mist started to grow along the treeline, and the sky marbled darker as we walked. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting contrast to walk upon a dewy trail that is slung right in the middle of lavish, green grass. I found a nice cross sectional piece of cedar which carried a rich, sweet aroma. After drinking from a busy stream, we turned to head back. Somehow we missed the pile of glistening shit that lay in the middle of the trail that was probably left by a coyote not too long before us. Rain drops spattered around us as the day descended away. Getting back in the car was a rude awakening to reality.
                              &lt;/p&gt;

                                  We headed back to the Bellevue area, consuming calories along the way. It was time to train again at CF Eastside. I&amp;rsquo;ve already given an account of clean and jerking 145 kg for five singles, squatting 450 lbs. for three sets of five, and doing some light bench press. I still felt the affects of this training session when I snatched on Wednesday. That night, we drank a bottle of mead, something I recommend to every nobleman out there.
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                                &lt;p&gt;

                                    &lt;br /&gt; Our little traveling crew had joked about finding a giant maple leaf before we left, yet we hadn&amp;rsquo;t really had the chance to look for one. When we approached the car on Tuesday morning, a maple leaf was waiting for us on the back windshield. A serendipitous delight, indeed.
                                  &lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;br /&gt; On the way back, our flight was delayed by two hours. This helped push back our return to Wichita Falls until after midnight. These trips to do barbell seminars are always worth it to me, and hopefully by chronicling them I can keep track of the people we meet that &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be getting 70&amp;rsquo;s Big (somebody&amp;rsquo;s gotta hold them accountable), allow those people to see the recap of their seminar group, list the food we eat, the delicious drinks we partake in, and any interesting experiences the group has. There&amp;rsquo;s not enough time to cover everything, but hopefully this gave you an idea of what we are up to.
                                      &lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;
                                          As for what goes on in the seminar itself, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to find that out on your own. For a synopsis, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://startingstrength.com&quot;&gt;StartingStrength.com&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you can find information about the new seminars that will begin in 2010 as well as the location of Rip&amp;rsquo;s question and answer forum that was previously located on Strengthmill.&lt;br /&gt;

  <p>I just got home to Wichita Falls, and it is 12:30 AM local time. Airline delays are delightful. This means that I won’t be giving you a full recap of the trip today. I’m sorry I’m not sorry. There will be plenty of shenanigans coming tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the mean time, enjoy this video AC made of his “Starting Strength Crew” in Statesboro, GA. Good group.</p>

  <p>Well, I have not had a computer since we have been in Seattle, so I have not been able to post. I do not have much time now, so there will be a full report Wednesday.</p>
<p>Last night I clean and jerked 140 kilos for five singles — the most I have ever done. Afterwords I squatted 204 kilos for three sets of five. My trunk is and was absolutely destroyed after doing this. If anybody tells you that the basic barbell exercises — squat, press, deadlift, bench, clean and jerk, and snatch — do not work the “core”, please tell them to kindly fuck off.</p>
<p><em>Note: I had literally 2 minutes to type this post last night, and I had intended on typing “core” as a very tongue-in-cheek comment. Hopefully I got that across, but we definitely do not use the term “core”.</em></p>

<p>“Hey, Big Mike, how are you doing?”</p>
<p>Enough about me, let’s talk about some strong guys.</p>
<p>Werner Günthör was a Swiss shot putter in the late eighties and early nineties. He won a European Championship (1986), a World Indoor Championship (1991), some World Championships (1987, 1991, 1993), competed in the 1984, 1988, and 1992 Olympics, and won a Bronze Medal in the 1988 summer games.</p>
<p>Aside from success as a thrower, Günthör is 6’7″, 280 pounds with a solid ’ stache and a feverish mullet. Observe…</p>
<p>———–</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of 70’s Big HoF shoe-in John Kuc from the 1979 World Powerlifting Championships. Kuc is pulling 859 lbs in the 242 class to total 2127 lbs — both world records at the time. This meet also had other powerlifting greats such as Lamar Gant, Larry Pacifico, and Bill Kazmaier winning their respective weight classes. On a side note, Rip has the original Powerlifting USA magazine that originally published <a href="http://vintagemusclemags.com/magCover.php?0;3;6;pl;Powerlifting+USA">this photo</a>. He has tons of magazines, and I’ll be scanning pictures out of them soon — especially of the good lookin’ ladies.</p>

<p>I received a video from 70’s Big enthusiast Mike from Mississippi. He lost his arm when he was fifteen in a machine related accident, but he is figuring out ways to train his 6’6″, 288 pound frame. The bar he’s using in this video is bent all to hell, but he still manages to front squat 135 with his one good arm. You can read more about him and his training <a href="http://www.onearmstrength.com/">here</a>. Oh, and he’s also sporting the 70’s Big t-shirt. Lookin’ good, Mike, lookin’ good.</p>
<p>If you guys have any videos of you or your trainees training, <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">send them on in</a>.</p>
<p>Off to Seattle this weekend to work a barbell seminar. Eat well and recover this weekend.</p>

<p>I’ve been training pretty hard since January, and focused that training on Olympic weightlifting a few months ago. There have been plenty of times where I didn’t feel like training. Plenty of times between sets where I didn’t know how I was going to summon the energy for the next one. But I always have. Admittedly part of that is due to an ability to induce an adequate release of adrenaline (a topic for another time), but that has to start with a proper mindset.</p>
<p>First, decide how important training is. For me, if I am going to train for something, I’m going to do it right, and my trainees will be the same. Even when I played football in high school and college, I never let anyone work harder than me. Performing to my best ability was the goal then, and it certainly is the goal now. If I slack on a given training session, then I don’t get stronger and better. If I don’t get stronger and better now, then I don’t hit my goals in the next lifting meet. That, my friends, is not an option. If improving through training is just not that important to you, then you should redefine your goals and your intentions. At that point you aren’t training, you’re just working out.</p>
<p>Let’s assume training is important to you for whatever reason. Depending on the goal, sport, or activity, there are many motivational factors for those days you “feel tired”. It isn’t my job to give you a list of these factors. It’s just my job to give you a kick in the ass to figure them out yourself. I don’t have time for people who “feel tired” when I coach, and I don’t have time for it on 70’s Big either.</p>
<p>There is a guy at our gym named Ronnie. He’s 60 years old, about 6’2″, 260 pounds and has been training at WFAC since he was 52. In the CrossFit Total Meet (lifting meet that consists of the squat, standing press, and deadlift) we had at the gym in February, Ronnie squatted 363. He went for 385, but it was dumped over his head, and he pulled his hamstring in the process. His recovery was arduous because of his age, but he stuck with it and eventually recovered. A couple months ago an MRI showed 3 bulging discs in his cervical spine. This caused the muscles in his left shoulder and triceps area to give out during pressing and bench pressing. Ron went from repping 225 for sets of twenty on the bench to barely being able to bench 135. He’s had one set back after another.</p>
<p>I started working with him so that we could figure out how to train around and through this problem while at the same time improving his squat given his cervical limitations. While working on the neuro deal, we tweaked the squat form, then worked the strength back up.</p>
<p>One day Ron came in the gym, and the man was tired. He was moving into a new house, running his furniture business, making his wife and granddaughters happy, and you could tell he was drained.</p>
<p>“How ya doin’, Ron?”</p>
<p>“I’m tired.”</p>
<p>Well, you know what Ron did next? He strapped on his belt, stretched his hamstrings, and started squatting. He didn’t complain, didn’t bitch — just continued loading the bar. We slapped on 300 pounds. 300 pounds for the man who hadn’t such weight on his back since dumping the 385 over his head 8 months previous (sorry about that, Ron! –&gt; I was a spotter). 300 pounds for the man with the three bulging discs. 300 pounds for the man who was tired. Ron stepped up to the bar, un-racked it, and squatted it five times.</p>
<p>If a 60 year old man can come in tired — legitimately tired — and squat 300 pounds for a set of five, then some how you can find the energy and the balls to get through your training session when “you’re tired”. I know I do.</p>

<p>I had a request for a video of me snatching, so I delivered. In this training session I am just doing some light singles at 110 kilograms to practice getting under the bar. Red, white, and blue, baby.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7446516">Justin Snatches – 11-4-09</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user2255573">70s Big</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Note: I don’t need anybody pointing out any faults you may see. Not only do I feel them precisely at the time that they occur, but I can see them in the video since I coach this shit. I also don’t care that you have a friend that is stronger than me; this is not a “penis length” contest.</p>
