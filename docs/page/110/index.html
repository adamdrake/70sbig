  <h2 id="get-strong-sean">Get strong, Sean</h2>
<p>I hope this website exists as a helpful source for people who want to get stronger and bigger. Lately, I’ve been getting more questions in my inbox about how to get 70’s Big, so I’ll just use these inquiries as a learning tool. If I can’t answer the question, I’ll find a reliable source who can. If you have a question, <a href="mailto:JLascek@gmail.com">e-mail me</a>.</p>
<p>The first question is from Sean, a 19 year old college freshman. He’s 6’2″, 210 pounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Justin,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m trying to get 70’s big. My current daily meals look like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Breakfast – 6 eggs, 1/2 a package of sausage = &gt; 1000 calories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lunch – Cheeseburgers from Wendy’s = &gt; 1500 calories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dinner – Peanut butter and banana sandwiches = &gt; 1500 calories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GOMAD = &gt; 2500 calories</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Total = &gt; 6500 calories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that this diet will not get me 70’s big, but it’s enough for now. I’m still making linear gains on <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=312&amp;action=show_detail">SS</a>. I plan to add a 4th meal to my diet when I begin to plateau on the lifts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My question is, do you have any recommendations for calorie/protein dense meals that require little preparation? Preferably something I can make a sandwich out of and take with me to school/work? I’m asking because I’d like to get out of the habit of eating Wendy’s every day. I’ve tried tuna sandwiches, but tuna doesn’t really have enough calories for me to call it a meal. Any insight is appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All of my friends think I’m insane for eating like this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>-Sean</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another e-mail, Sean let me know where his lifts were at:</p>
<p>Squat 270x5x3</p>
<p>Deadlift 315×5</p>
<p>Press 95x5x3</p>
<p>Bench 135x5x3</p>
<p>Power Clean 145x3x5</p>
<p>Sean is at a decent bodyweight, and with consistent training his lifts will catch up with it. He’s doing a good job of eating so far, and 6,000 calories is probably enough since his lifts are relatively low. My friend Cliff had to amp his caloric intake up to around 8,000 calories to make the push from 210 to 220, but his lifts were a bit heavier (thus they produce more stress on the body).</p>
<p>In any case, Sean is asking about protein and calorie dense foods that are quick to prepare. He wants to stop purchasing his lunch since he’s in college, so we’ll stick to inexpensive homemade ideas.</p>
<p>The easiest and cheapest thing to do when trying to get 70’s Big is to grill a bunch of meat for the whole week. I like to do it on Sundays, because then the rest of the week’s meals are taken care of. Go to a decent super market and look for their meat specials. One time I found about three pounds of boneless rib meat for five dollars — I barbecued the hell out of it on an open wood fire, and it was glorious.</p>
<p>At the same super market they sell 8 hamburger patties for about eight dollars. This is only a dollar per burger, which is going to be what you spend at a fast food restaurant for a smaller, crappier piece of meat that doesn’t taste as good. I used to routinely eat a burger topped with cheese and barbecue sauce for breakfast when I was training people.</p>

    Grilling meat is preferable, but you can always marinade chicken in something like Italian dressing and cook it on the stove. Find the meats with the lowest price for their quantity and try and figure out how you can marinate and cook them to make them tasty. Hopefully this gives Sean some ideas. The lesson here is start your week prepared. If you wait until you are out of food to find food, then you are doing a shitty job of preparing. Get strong, Sean.<br /> <br /> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br /> <br /> Andy Baker owns a gym called <a href="http://www.kingwoodstrength.com/">Kingwood Strength and Conditioning</a> in Kingwood, Texas (near Houston).

  <h2 id="8220there-ricky-bruch-you-can-argue-that-too8221">“There, Ricky Bruch, you can argue that too.”</h2>
<p>70’s Big will always take a stand against conventional fitness wisdom and the fitness industry. It is a money oriented industry that thrives on selling a shortcut to emaciation. Being skinny with abs is just not impressive nor productive. This demographic will fall early and fast when the inevitable zombie outbreak occurs.</p>
<p>Face it, the following video is full of guys that are doomed to be zombie fodder:</p>
<p>Wow, that was a lot of underweight guys who probably wear skinny jeans. Surely those non-adult-males could have made better money as an extra in a porno or something (you know, like a guy eating a sandwich in the background…they needed one anyway). And the device itself is…inadequate. I can get plenty of exercise for the “hand shandy muscles” on my own, thank you.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>Today is the day that you get acquainted with <strong>Ricky Bruch</strong>. In short, the guy is fucking insane. It’s hard to glean any interesting information, because all the juicy stuff is just hearsay. From what I found in my “research” (which consisted of YouTube and eating snacks) is that he is a Swedish discus thrower who won a bronze medal in the 1972 Olympic Games. However, a steroid fiasco kept him out of further competition, and this pissed Ricky off. A lot. He trained like an absolute madman (which you’ll see in the video below), and proceeded to throw the discus between 3 and 5 meters further than the current world record (unofficial sources vary with the distance). After he stopped taking steroids, there are reports that he took about 750 vitamin pills a day while improving his performance even more.</p>
<p>If anybody has any sources on him, or they own his documentary/biography called <em>The Soul Is Greater Than the World</em>, let me know. It’s supposed to be very inspiring because of his undying motivation to get better. He has the perfect equation of</p>
<p>Beard + Mustache + Strong + Big + Intense Training + Insanity</p>
<p>Our kinda guy.</p>
<p>The following video has some clips of him training. It gets good around the 2:00 minute mark. If you are short on time, and only want to see him freak out, then go to the 3:00 minute mark. Lots of yelling.</p>
<p>After that first video above, we had to double up on the testosterone. Thanks Ricky.</p>

  <h2 id="8220why-would-anyone-want-to-eat-like-that8221">“Why would anyone want to eat like that?”</h2>
<p>I’ve always liked food. I’ll admit that I really didn’t know how to eat it, though.</p>
<p>Rippetoe reminds me of a medieval gentile; meat and mead are all he needs. I’ve seen him eat at least 10 different styles of meat, and every single one of them makes him say, “That’s the best shit you could ever put in your mouth!”</p>
<p>My buddy Chris is a grilling aficionado. It’s customary for him to grill pounds and pounds of meat, only to have them ground into satisfying bathroom visits within a day or so.</p>
<p>Gant is pretty serious about his eating, especially during a weight gaining phase. In fact, after the JM Blakely post, he brought in a two pound hunk of brisket to snack on while he trained. That’s dedication.</p>
<p>Gant invited me over for dinner last night. Some how he knew my chicken fried steak quota for the week had not been met. I walked in the kitchen to see him frying steaks, frying biscuits, and preparing mashed potatoes. It was just what I needed.</p>
<p>We each had about a pound of meat, quite a few fried biscuits, and generous helpings of mashed potatoes. It was easily a 2,000 calorie meal. This meal is particularly interesting for Gant, because he’s in the middle of moving back down to the 90 kilogram weight class for judo after competing in the 100 kg class. Hearty meals don’t scare this man.</p>

  <p>
    Gant, Chris, and I were once eating at a local burger joint after training and we were all eating large double bacon cheeseburgers. This equals one pound of beef not counting the bacon, cheese, bun, or condiments. As we ate, Gant matter of factly said, &#8220;This is about the amount of protein your average CrossFitter would eat in a day while on the zone.&#8221; He was referencing The Zone Diet in which food is roughly weighed and measured for every meal. 16 blocks is a typical prescription, and this would equate to 16 ounces of meat. Chris, who weighed around 250 at the time, didn&rsquo;t understand. He stared, horrified at Gant, and said, &#8220;Why would anyone want to live like that?&#8221;<br /> <em>Edit: Brent was eating with us too. Sorry, Brent.</em><br /> <br /> Got any good food pictures? Gant and Chris love to document the food that they build, and you should too.<br />

    The epitome of 70’s Big

</div>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <p>
    When the website went live, one of the first things that my friend Chris did was compile a list of things that would or would not exhibit what 70’s Big is all about. I share his concern. You see, 70’s Big has been alive for the better part of 2009. You, the reader, are at a disadvantage. You may not intuitively know what is acceptable.<br /> <br /> Hell, you may open your tub of soy protein after gelling your hair while listening to Nickelback and sipping a smoothie. For god’s sakes, this is for your own good! Okay? I can’t have you going around talking to your friends about 70’s Big when you’re convincing someone that your shirt is fucshia with a Bud Light in your hand. And I’m pretty sure Rip would find the athleticism to backflip kick you in the jaw if you were convinced Crown Royal was the best kind of whiskey. Look, it’s just bad for my reputation if you talk about 70’s Big after shaving your chest, doing a few sets of curls and push-ups, then hitting up the bar with your favorite &#8220;whore-stink&#8221; cologne on.<br /> <br /> No, I can’t have that. There has to be some standards, dammit.<br />

  <h2 id="8220donrsquot-forget-there-is-a-good-lookin-female-drinking-more-milk-than-you-are8221">“Don’t forget: there is a good lookin’ female drinking more milk than you are”</h2>
<p>We’ve had a few posts that explain what type and amounts of food you’ll need to consume if you’re wanting to get 70’s Big. Some people, however, don’t realize the purpose of this level of food intake. As always, it depends on your individual situation.</p>
<p>No one is suggesting you eat a giant bowl of ice cream, brownies, and magic shell if you already weigh 250. However, if you weigh 150, you better be stuffing your face. The “professional eating” approach is always suggested for guys who weigh under 200 pounds.</p>
<p>Remember: <strong>Adult Males &gt; 200 pounds</strong></p>
<p>A gallon of whole milk a day usually does the trick, regardless of who you are. My buddy John Sheaffer and I both drink at least a gallon, and I weigh 225 and he weighs 235 (he’ll be making a strong push to get to 250 by December, and eventually will make it to 275). Whole milk has a beautiful balance of calories, fat, carboydrates, and protein. Remember, it exists to make baby mammals grow, so start suckling the teat of growth.</p>
<p>There is a good looking girl at <a href="http://frontrangecrossfit.com">the gym we held a seminar at</a> in Denver this past weekend. The gym owners, Jodi and Skip, told me that she drinks 6 gallons of milk a week while strength training, weightlifting, and doing conditioning workouts. She weighs 150 with very little bodyfat. In other words, she eats according to the needs of her activity and sport. If you’re trying to gain considerable size and strength, go with the shovel technique. If you are at the optimum bodyweight at your given height, then eat to maintain the muscle mass you already have. In any case, don’t ever forget that there is a good looking female who is drinking more milk than you are.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>The following photo was submitted by Randy, a deployed US Marine. Apparently they can’t get a gallon of milk when deployed, so they have to get creative with their calories.</p>

<p>Rip references the directory of 70’s Big conducive gyms in this video. <strong>It will be very difficult to be added to this select list</strong>. The qualifying factors include your openness to helping new members, equipment, gym philosophy, the training of the owner(s), and a stable of people that are working to get strong. This list will be comparable to Bill Starr’s list of “Gyms Friendly To Weightlifters” that was published in <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&rn=294&action=show_detail" target="_blank">Defying Gravity</a> (a good, quick read for anybody competing in the barbell sports).</p>

  In order to be 70&rsquo;s Big, you don&rsquo;t need to be donning garb from the time period nor do you have to be actually from the era. You just need to be big and strong. You&rsquo;d sure as hell look so much cooler if you were rockin&rsquo; seventies garb, though. Insert <a href="http://skatersocks.com/">Skater Socks</a> here. An excerpt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">
  Growing up in the 70&rsquo;s rocking my tube socks skating around town was a part of my childhood dreams. I loved tube socks! I had most all colors they offered at the time for my simple pleasure of having a sweet collection of striped tube socks made me super duper happy as a child. My childhood dreams were so simple and pure.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">
  And so are ours. This site has an insanely large collection tube socks in any length or color that you could ever want. Not only that, but they have pictures of chicks wearing knee-high socks, and we all like chicks, right?
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
  <p style="text-align: left">
    Socks like these really tie the room together, especially if you&rsquo;re goal is to don apparel from the seventies. I&rsquo;d suggest getting some to complete your Halloween costume.

  <h2 id="8220i-never-used-ammonia-it-always-pissed-me-off8221">“I never used ammonia, it always pissed me off”</h2>
<p>I’m a bit late posting because we got in late last night from doing a barbell seminar in Denver — a guy needs sleep, ok?</p>
<p>It’s a lot of fun having friends who are strong, and my good friend AC is one of those people who is pain-in-the-ass strong. He’s on the brink of plateauing in his linear progression. Yesterday he squatted 450 for three sets of five, pressed 212 for three sets of five, and a few weeks ago deadlifted 500 for five…all at a bodyweight of 205. Oh, and he’s 20 years old.</p>
<p>Since he has pretty much linearly progressed his deadlift, I gave him the green light to work up to a 1RM yesterday. Keep in mind that he squatted and pressed the previously mentioned numbers before pulling this.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7037665">A.C. Max Out</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user802431">A.C.</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>He missed 575 at the knees after that last attempt. AC will start competing in powerlifting and eventually weightlifting. He’s also a pretty good coach, so if you’re in the Atlanta area and want some coaching, <a href="mailto:ac@70sbig.com">e-mail him</a>. You can also find him in south Georgia when he’s at school.</p>
<p>AC is also the one who edits the Rippetoe interview videos, and here is part 7 of the 70’s Big Interview with Rip:</p>

  This past weekend I got to hang out with my buddy John Sheaffer while we coached at Rippetoe’s barbell seminar. We’re both on the quest to getting 70’s Big; I just started competing in weightlifting and he’ll compete in powerlifting. JP is the owner of <a href="http://greyskullelite.com">Greyskull Barbell</a> in Pennsylvania, home of many obnoxiously strong men, women, and kids.  He’ll be a regular contributor to this site.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
   
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
  The seminar was at <a href="http://www.frontrangecrossfit.typepad.com/">Front Range CrossFit</a>. Despite the name on the door, this gym has the equipment to get 70’s Big. Their facility is set up for Olympic lifting with 10 platforms, jerk blocks, and a couple of squat racks. They are also building a weightlifting team, so if you’re interested and live in the Denver area, check them out.

<p style="text-align: left">

<p style="text-align: left">
  Your gym can be featured and eventually added to a list of &#8220;70’s Big Gyms&#8221; as long as it has the proper equipment. If you’re interested, <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">e-mail me</a>.

<p>Go ahead and face it now; you are average. If you were a genetic freak, somebody would have noticed by now. More than likely you are sitting here reading this, and you want to be stronger and like learning about guys that are strong (or you like looking at guys that are strong…and are female?). In any case, you aren’t in that small percentage of the gene pool that are genetically predisposed to being freakishly strong.</p>
<p>Do you realize what this means? You have to get strong and big with good ol’ fashion <a href="/content/do_hard_things.pdf">hard work</a>.</p>
<p>There are no shortcuts. You have to follow a carefully made training program. You have to eat more than you want to, especially when you don’t want to. You have to find the energy to conquer that last work set of squats or deadlifts when nobody is around and there is no glory. You have to realize that if you avoid doing the things that are hard, then you are preventing yourself from accomplishing your goals.</p>
<p>How badly do you want to be strong? How badly do you want to be competitive? How badly do you want to be 70’s Big?</p>

    We look up to the demigods of 70’s Big yore (above), and they are gifted individuals. They undoubtedly worked hard, but you may not be so genetically fortunate. You will need to bust your ass for the same progress that others can make easily. You cannot afford to dick around with training, eating, or rest. You don’t have time to allow yourself to make excuses, so don’t bother.<br /> <br /> So, sit down tonight and have a beer (<em>Note: not <a href="http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/famecrawler/2008/02/bud-light-logo-bottle.jpg">fermented</a> <a href="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/08/marketing_to_men/image/miller.jpg">deer</a> <a href="http://www.amoeba.com/dynamic-images/blog/707.jpg">piss</a></em>). As you sip, think about how your training can improve on Monday. Figure out what you can do better.<br /> <br /> ’Cause you gotta make sacrifices if you wanna be 70’s Big.<br /> <br /> <strong>Click &#8220;read more&#8221; for more fun.</strong><br /> <br />

    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br /> <br /> <strong>Some comments to the critics:</strong><br /> <br /> The use of 70&rsquo;s Big instead of &rsquo;70s Big is intentional. The apostrophe insinuates possession since the quality of being big is owned by the seventies (in our case).<br /> <br /> It&rsquo;s also important to note that someone who is considered 70&rsquo;s Big did not have to be active in the seventies nor do they have to be donning seventies garb. The name has become a concept that signifies being strong and big. When someone is called 70&rsquo;s Big, it is of the highest achievement someone can attain, short of a world or Olympic championship.<br /> <br /> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br /> <br /> This <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/10/06/the-criticism-that-r.html">article</a>from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing </a>entertained me thoroughly. It references a supposedly poorly photoshopped picture of <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/09/29/lauren.jpg">this Ralph Lauren model</a>. Apparently Ralph Lauren tried to shut down their ISP, and Boing Boing had this to say in response:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      So, to Ralph Lauren, GreenbergTraurig, and PRL Holdings, Inc: sue and be damned. Copyright law doesn&rsquo;t give you the right to threaten your critics for pointing out the problems with your offerings. You should know better. And every time you threaten to sue us over stuff like this, we will:<br /> <br /> a) Reproduce the original criticism, making damned sure that all our readers get a good, long look at it, and;<br /> <br /> b) Publish your spurious legal threat along with copious mockery, so that it becomes highly ranked in search engines where other people you threaten can find it and take heart; and<br /> <br /> c) Offer nourishing soup and sandwiches to your models.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Fantastic. Over the past year whenever I&rsquo;ve seen a skinny girl, I&rsquo;ve said that she needed x number of sandwiches (depending on how skinny). The Ralph Lauren look-a-likes need a cheeseburger. With bacon.<br /> <br /> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br /> <br /> Finally, let&rsquo;s finish our week-long Pisarenko dedication with a video of him clean and jerking his personal best (and just short of the overall world record) 265 kilograms &#8212; an asinine 584.225 pounds:<br /> <br /> <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/UURIs159pYI?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span><br /> <br /> P.S.

<p>70sBig.com does not merely suggest that you only become strong. My friend Gant — a competition enthusiast and judo player — said to me recently, “What’s the point of being 70’s Big if you can’t <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp324EZGY3A">throw anybody around</a>?” He’s got a point.</p>
<p>Aiming to only get strong and big is a waste of hard work and developed talent. Anybody wanting to become 70’s Big would probably enjoy displaying their strength, and what better way to to do so than to compete? It isn’t a coincidence that our 70’s Big co-captains, Doug Young and Anatoly Pisarenko, were successful in the sport of powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting respectively.</p>
<p>Besides, aiming your goals at a specific sport will not only justify the purpose of training, but it will fuel your desire to improve. The official stance of this website is that its members should participate in sport in congruence with their strength training.</p>
<p>Sports that specialize in the development of strength and power would be excellent choices. Some options include, but are not limited to powerlifting, weightlifting, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_games">highland games</a>, football, throwing implements (track and field style), throwing people (judo), wrestling, and strongman competitions. As this site grows, you’ll see that there are men who are 70’s Big in each of these sports.</p>
<p>Some of the aforementioned sports separate competitors by weight class. This seems to be a dichotomy to the idea of 70’s Big, but ease your troubled mind. There is a bodyweight at which a person will function optimally for a particular sport (typically dictated by height). Gant will eventually share his story of changing weight classes for judo, but he’d probably tell you he functions best in the 90 kilo class. This doesn’t make him 70’s Big, but the quest is never over, my friends. Athletes will function better in sport, especially in the sports listed here, when they are stronger. So you see, everyone is on a quest towards 70’s Big. And that is a beautiful thing indeed.</p>
<p>As scheduled, here is part 6 of the 70’s Big Interview with Rippetoe. This is one of my favorite parts of the interview, because it explains what a female would look like who would be fit for a 70’s Big guy.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/6874218">70’s Big Presents: Mark Rippetoe Interview Pt. 6</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user2255573">70s Big</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
