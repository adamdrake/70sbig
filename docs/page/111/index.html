  <h2 id="8220you-mean-i-never-told-you-the-secret-to-gaining-weight8221"><strong>“You mean I never told you the secret to gaining weight?”</strong></h2>
<p><em>The following is a write up by my friend Gant</em></p>
<p>This nugget comes from <strong>JM Blakely</strong>, a bench press specialist who was known for gaining and losing significant amounts of weight depending on where he was in his training cycle. He wrote several articles for Powerlifting USA, including “<strong>The Big Boy’s Menu Plan</strong>“ ****(reprinted <a href="http://www.wannabebig.com/forums/showpost.php?s=2e6c1d7eb7b0326c0dabce0c4ce2dbd7&amp;p=1370706&amp;postcount=1">here</a>).</p>
<p>The article is gold. The summary: there are no hard gainers, only undisciplined eaters.</p>
<p>Blakely is specifically addressing bulking cycles for powerlifting. But anyone on the path to 70’s Big can can benefit from this knowledge. Make no mistake, eating for mass requires effort equal to that which you put into your training.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.tmuscle.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_interviews/37_tips_and_tales_from_dave_tate">article</a> article, Dave Tate tells how Blakely helped him over a mass plateau. Prepare to be inspired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a time at the Old Westside gym where I couldn’t gain weight to save my fucking life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There was this dude who trained there who could just put on weight like fucking magic. He’d go from 198 to 308 and then to 275 and back down to 198. And he was never fat. It was amazing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I finally asked him one day how he did it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You mean I never told you the secret to gaining weight? Come outside and I’ll fill you in.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now remember, we’re at Westside Barbell. And this guy wants to go outside to talk so no one else can hear. Think about that for a minute. What the hell is he going to tell me? This must be some serious shit if we have to go outside, I thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So we get outside and he starts talking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“For breakfast you need to eat four of those breakfast sandwiches from McDonalds. I don’t care which ones you get, but make sure to get four. Order four hash browns, too. Now grab two packs of mayonnaise and put them on the hash browns and then slip them into the sandwiches. Squish that shit down and eat. That’s your breakfast.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point I’m thinking this guy is nuts. But he’s completely serious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“For lunch you’re gonna eat Chinese food. Now I don’t want you eating that crappy stuff. You wanna get the stuff with MSG. None of that non-MSG bullshit. I don’t care what you eat but you have to sit down and eat for at least 45 minutes straight. You can’t let go of the fork. Eat until your eyes swell up and become slits and you start to look like the woman behind the counter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“For dinner you’re gonna order an extra-large pizza with everything on it. Literally everything. If you don’t like sardines, don’t put ’em on, but anything else that you like you have to load it on there. After you pay the delivery guy, I want you to take the pie to your coffee table, open that fucker up, and grab a bottle of oil. It can be olive oil, canola oil, whatever. Anything but motor oil. And I want you to pour that shit over the pie until half of the bottle is gone. Just soak the shit out of it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now before you lay into it, I want you to sit on your couch and just stare at that fucker. I want you to understand that that pizza right there is keeping you from your goals.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This guy is in a zen-like state when he’s talking about this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now you’re on the clock,” he continues. “After 20 minutes your brain is going to tell you you’re full. Don’t listen to that shit. You have to try and eat as much of the pizza as you can before that 20-minute mark. Double up pieces if you have to. I’m telling you now, you’re going to get three or four pieces in and you’re gonna want to quit. You fucking can’t quit. You have to sit on that couch until every piece is done.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you can’t finish it, don’t you ever come back to me and tell me you can’t gain weight. ’Cause I’m gonna tell you that you don’t give a fuck about getting bigger and you don’t care how much you lift!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did I do it? Hell yeah. Started the next day and did it for two months. Went from 260 pounds to 297 pounds. And I didn’t get much fatter. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life, though.</p>

    <strong>Pisarenko Week</strong> continues with a look at Pisarenko’s championships. The Pizz won multiple USSR Championships (1982 and 1984), European Championships (1981, 1982, 1983, and 1984), and World Championships (1981, 1982, and 1983). Pisarenko set 13 world records in his short career in the super heavyweight class.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he was unable to participate in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics. He missed out on the 1980 Olympics because two of his veteran teammates were selected to lift for the USSR (even though he lifted more than both of them). In 1984, the USSR pulled out of the Olympics for a number of political reasons. By the 1988 Olympics, Pisarenko’s lifting career was over.<br /> <br /> Check out <a href="http://www.chidlovski.net/liftup/l_athleteResult.asp?a_id=524" target="_blank">this website</a> for a detailed look at his championships and totals.<br /> <br /> The following video is from the 1982 World Championships and outlines Pisarenko’s battle with Antonio Krastev (Bulgaria). It shows the top snatches in the super heavyweight weight class. This is a rare look at Pisarenko lifting in a meet and speaking with his coaches backstage. Tomorrow we will watch Krastev and Pisarenko battle in the clean and jerk finale. Enjoy watching this beast of a man.<br /> <br /> <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BKQGTEv0W0?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span><br /> <br /> <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Pisarenko was a former Greco-Roman wrestler. I can&rsquo;t think of any males that would like to have his hands on them. Females, however, are a different story.<br />

    70’s Big
  </p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <p>
    This week honors our second 70’s Big co-captain, Anatoly Pisarenko. To put it simply, Pisarenko is to Olympic lifting as Doug Young is to powerlifting. Unfortunately he lacks the fame of other successful weightlifters because he was unable to attend the 1980 and 1984 Olympics for different reasons. Despite this, his peers respected his work ethic &#8212; the above quote was from  Vasiliy Alekseyev.<br /> <br /> Olympics or not, Pisarenko was god awful strong. His career bests were a 206 kg snatch in 1983 (Moscow) and a 265 kg clean and jerk in 1984 (Varna) &#8212; this ties him for second overall for the highest clean and jerk (the world records say otherwise since old records were dropped with the restructuring of the weight classes). To put this in perspective for those not familiar with kilograms, he snatched 454.15 lbs and clean and jerked 584.22 pounds!<br /> <br /> It’s quite clear why &#8220;The Pizz&#8221; is one of our favorite lifters; he&rsquo;s strong, he&rsquo;s big, and for god&rsquo;s sake, he&rsquo;s got a mustache.<br /> <br />

<p>Today wraps up our week-long dedication to 70’s Big co-captain Doug Young as well as the marker for his induction into the 70’s Big Hall of Fame. The behemoth that is Doug Young is one of the most impressive men I’ve ever seen in pictures. It’s a shame that he passed away a few years ago.</p>
<p>Our pal Mark Rippetoe saw Doug in person 29 years ago, and tells us the story in the following video:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Omyx-MyQicM?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>

  <h2 id="8220what-do-i-eat8221">“What do I eat?”</h2>
<p>I get a lot of questions about what kind of stuff someone should eat if they are trying to get 70’s Big. Well, recently I wrote out a food log for my pal Cliff. Remember, getting enough protein and calories is vital, especially when dealing with a guy that has been skinny his whole life. Cliff needed an extra boost to continue his novice linear progression, and here is what we did:</p>
<div id="attachment_182" style="width: 455px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182" data-attachment-id="182" data-permalink="/blog/2009/10/rip-tells-about-doug-young/cliff_food_plan/" data-orig-file="/2009/10/cliff_food_plan.JPG" data-orig-size="846,664" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="cliff_food_plan" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2009/10/cliff_food_plan-400x313.jpg" data-large-file="/2009/10/cliff_food_plan.JPG" class="size-medium wp-image-182" title="cliff_food_plan" src="/2009/10/cliff_food_plan-400x313.jpg" alt="cliff_food_plan" width="445" height="348" srcset="/2009/10/cliff_food_plan-400x313.jpg 400w, /2009/10/cliff_food_plan.JPG 846w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" />

<p style="text-align: left">
  <p>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left">
    Here are a few things to note:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I immensely underestimated the calories for some of the snacks, especially the ice cream and magic shell combo
    </li>
    <li>
      The &#8220;10 oz&#8221; refers to sirloin steak
    </li>
    <li>
      The &#8220;8 oz&#8221; refers to chicken breasts
    </li>
    <li>
      Notice he eats two of each per day
    </li>
    <li>
      Cliff drinks a gallon of whole milk a day
    </li>
    <li>
      Cliff was only eating almonds for a snack at work, now it is calorie dense trail mix
    </li>
    <li>
      Cliff found ice cream and nutella to be a nice little combo at night
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="text-align: left">
    <br /> The most important points are that Cliff has increased his bodyweight from 185 to 215, improved his squat from 145x5x3 to doing 305x5x3 last night, and launched his deadlift from 225&#215;5 to 405&#215;5. All this in 2.5 months.<br /> <br /> No, he is not fat. When you are skinny your whole life, not only is it hard to gain fat, but you don’t get to have an opinion on what fat is.<br /> <br /> And he’s not done yet.<br /> Let us know about any cool meals or snacks that have helped you recover. Remember, you can e-mail videos or pictures to <a href="mailto:media@70sbig.com">media@70sbig.com</a>.<br />

A story will be told about how he was an imposing individual who was respected by the entire powerlifting community. This is why he is the co-captain of 70sBig.com, and why he is our first entry into the &#8220;70&rsquo;s Big Hall of Fame&#8221;.

  <h2 id="see-women-can-do-it-too">See, women can do it too!</h2>
<p>Women typically have a paranoid view of barbell training in that they think it will make them “bulky” or “big”. This is a typical misconception that forgets that women don’t produce the same levels of testosterone that men do. Furthermore, “bulky” is a meaningless subjective term that is relative to all of the underweight women scattered around television and magazines.</p>
<p>Women can and should barbell train. For the most part they adapt in the same way that males do, albeit slower. And to be honest, most girls, regardless of body composition, can stand to gain 10 to 20 pounds of muscle (the same way that most guys need to gain 30 to 50 pounds of muscle). It’s important to note that women will not achieve the status of 70’s Big (since that would be scary thing, indeed), but being stronger with more muscle mass improves the “toned” look that so many of them aim for.</p>
<p>In any case, even with all of these sterotypes and misconceptions, there <em>are</em> women who barbell train successfully. We have a few here at WFAC:</p>

  <h2 id="this-isnt-just-8220working-out8221">This isn’t just “working out”</h2>
<p>There are some people who are not familiar with the primary method of training implemented at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club to get 70’s Big. If 70’s Big is the goal, then strength is the goal. A novice will make the most successful strength gains doing a simple linear progression with five basic barbell lifts: squat, deadlift, press, bench press, and power clean. These movements are extensively analyzed and taught in the text <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/tacpr/?page_id=110">“Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training, 2nd Ed.”</a> by Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore. The explanation of how the body adapts to strength training as well as how to program the barbell lifts is elaborated on within <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/tacpr/?page_id=690">“Practical Programming for Strength Training, 2nd Ed.”</a> by Rippetoe and Kilgore. There isn’t a better resource for any level of trainee and coach regarding strength training. You’ll need it if you are on the quest to being 70’s Big.</p>
<p>The local fitness gym is full of people working out. The skinny girl is running and the upper body boy is doing curls in the squat rack because that is what they decided to do that day. Their goals are vague and typically revolve around being nude with the opposite sex. Moving around and getting sweaty without a plan is called working out (or some kind of activity with the opposite sex). Training, on the other hand, has a goal in mind. Each training session has a task that is known before hand, and that task aids in accomplishing the known goal of training.</p>
<p>The majority of people who are actually training for a sport would benefit from improving their strength. Strength is the fundamental capacity for all other physical attributes. Strength and/or strength training, when done properly, will improve everything from speed to flexibility. Since this is the case, it would behoove the majority of trainees to exhaust the potential of making linear gains in strength for as long as possible. When this is done correctly, an increase in muscular bodyweight will occur.</p>
<p>An increase in muscular bodyweight will not be detrimental to performance regardless of sport. With muscles comes more force production ability that translates into performing the desired task easier and more efficiently. A bigger motor does not slow the car down. On the other hand, excessive junk in the trunk can.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that in an increase in strength and subsequently size occurs, proper recovery is required. Recovery is dependent on nutrition, particularly protein and total caloric intake. The amount of these two variables is independent to an individual, but most individuals will be in a position in which they need to gain muscular bodyweight. It has been recommended in “Practical Programming” that a person in this situation should consume at least one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight.</p>
<p>Protein alone does not ensure proper recovery and/or weight gain. Total calories will affect the recovery from structural and metabolic fatigue. In this case, an excess of caloric intake is necessary. The amount of other macro-nutrients (fat or carbohydrates) that should be consumed with protein are typically unimportant at this point as long as a caloric excess occurs. This emphasis of macro-nutrients may change with advancement.</p>
<p>A perfect way to consume enough protein and calories to get 70’s Big is to drink a gallon of whole milk and consume AT LEAST three hearty meals a day. Requirements change depending on an individual and their specific circumstances, but this is a good rule of thumb to abide by (and The Dude abides). No one is suggesting that all people need to drink a gallon of whole milk a day, but those who are in need of muscular bodyweight would be foolish to not do so.</p>
<p>The emphasis here is that eating is not only equally important to training – it IS training. You don’t get stronger in the gym, you get stronger from eating and recovering outside of the gym. And chances are that you aren’t eating enough.</p>
<p>To continue with Doug Young Week, here is a video of a short interview with Doug Young along with footage from the 1977 IPF World Championships. Doug won the world championship with a total of 1956 pounds (699-545-710) — <strong>with three broken ribs</strong>. It is one of the most impressive performances in powerlifting history.</p>

<p>70sBig.com has a couple of co-captains that exhibit the epitome of being 70’s Big. We will honor the first by having a week dedicated to Doug Young, a prolific powerlifter from the 1970’s. Each post this week will display stories and information that explain why Doug Young is one of the most respected powerlifters of his time.</p>

    70’s Big co-captain Doug Young
  </p>
</div>
<p>Doug was a national and world champion multiple times throughout his career while competing in the 242 pound class. In the 1977 nationals, he posted a 2017 pound total (squatting 722, benching 556, and deadlifting 738). Doug was known for his benching ability, and is credited with bench of 612 pounds in 1978. These are incredible feats given his bodyweight, but even more so because he wasn’t wearing a bench shirt or squat suit (pieces of equipment that are more prevalent in powerlifting today).</p>

<p>We hope you enjoyed the first week of our website. 70’s Big is a lifestyle worth living. It requires a lot of hard work in training and eating, but the lessons learned from such hard work resonate in life.</p>

<h1 id="do-hard-things">Do Hard Things</h1>
<h2 id="justin-lascek">Justin Lascek</h2>
<p>I’ve trained here at Wichita Falls Athletic Club since I arrived in January and have been fortunate enough to have Rip’s coaching eyes on me. I haven’t had any coaching in weight training since high school, and that early coaching wasn’t at the caliber of Rip. I’ve exponentially become a better coach and lifter since receiving the concise, efficient methods that Rip has groomed and utilized through years of experience.</p>
<p>Within the first month of being here, I actually trained with Rip while he coached me. Keep in mind I didn’t know Rip then as well as I do now. I’ve seen him train numerous times since, but this was the first time I experienced what he goes through when he trains.</p>
<p>I had been awake that morning since I opened the gym at 6:00 AM. I trained in the manner of the “Starting Strength” protocol (a novice linear progression) by squatting, bench pressing, and power snatching. Throughout the day I coached a class and a few individual sessions. It was after 11:00 PM when Rip started training, as is his custom. Rip planned to clean and press while coaching me on the push-jerk. Before we started I was already drained; dead if you will.</p>
<p>Rip had already started warming up, and I could almost feel him crackling and creaking. He is not a particularly old man; however he was a competitive powerlifter for a decade and has been through all kinds of comically horrible injuries. Being a powerlifter (and injury prone) is an incredibly different situation with an incredibly different demand on the body than someone who is simply training for fitness. In other words, when Rip warms up, it looks like an incredibly painful endeavor.</p>
<p>So, what was I going to do? Tell him I was tired and sleepy?</p>
<p>I went and got my lifting shoes.</p>
<p>When you watch Rip lift, you can see that he is in pain. His face contorts like twisted leather and as he struggles to lockout each press, his grimace darkens with intensity and concentration. His right elbow and left shoulder cannot lockout very well, yet he presses nonetheless. When Rip locks a press overhead the best he can, he lets the bar fall to the ground. He immediately walks away from the bar, and sometimes mutters an obscenity while squinting his eyes closed before he opens them as wide as he can. It’s the kind of thing a person would do if they are experiencing immense pain.</p>
<p>“Does every rep hurt like shit?” I ask him.</p>
<p>“Yes. Every fucking rep.”</p>
<p>He makes a note in his log book, and says over his shoulder, “I haven’t had a pain free workout in twenty years.” And he hasn’t. I’ve seen his workout logs from that long ago.</p>
<p>Imagine every rep in your workout being one of the more painful experiences of your life. Imagine knowing that it’s going to be that painful every time you step towards the barbell. Imagine having to actively ignore the current and future pain you are and will experience every set. Imagine doing that for every workout. Now imagine doing that for twenty years. A lesser man would have given up long ago. And that’s the point.</p>
<p>No, I’m not here to build up any kind of legend that might be Mark Rippetoe. I’m breaking him down to what he simply is; someone who does something really fucking hard on a consistent basis knowing that it is going to be really fucking hard before he does it. This concept is infinitely important to us all.</p>
<p>First, we should never avoid doing something (like training) when we know it will suck. Avoiding doing something that is hard makes you a coward and you can never experience or learn anything valuable by being a coward.</p>
<p>Next, by convincing ourselves to do something that is hard when we don’t want to, we are growing. We are displaying a quality of strength that will correlate and resonate far from the barbell.</p>
<p>Lastly, by overcoming hard obstacles on a consistent basis, we set ourselves up efficiently for success. Our thoughts formulate our feelings, our feelings compose our emotions, our emotions are exhibited through actions, and our actions define who we are. If we can structure our thoughts in a successful mindset, one that strives towards success regardless of the obstacle, then it makes us a better person. One of the best ways to train to do this is to do something that is really fucking hard. And then do that on a regular basis.</p>
<p>When you skip doing deadlifts at the end of the workout because they are hard, you are a coward. When you give up on trying to grind through a press, you are quitting. And you’re sure as hell capable of training if you are experiencing pain. There is a difference between injury pain and regular pain. There is a difference between hard and less hard when you can choose the former. This is the difference between a chickenshit and a Man.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to listen to me, you could ask Rip; just don’t be surprised when he rolls his eyes.</p>

<p>Every Monday and Thursday we’ll post parts of the Mark Rippetoe interview. For those of you who don’t know, Rip is a barbell coach who originally learned under Bill Starr and has been coaching the lifts for about 30 years. Currently he writes as well as travels to coach at barbell seminars. You can learn about his work at <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/">The Aasgaard Company’s website</a>.</p>
<p>Here is part two if the interview:</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/6723596">70’s Big Presents: Interview with Mark Rippetoe Pt. 2</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user2255573">70s Big</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>We have quite a few people getting 70’s Big at the WFAC. Shelley and Melissa get stronger every week despite obscure injuries, Colton and Kyle are our young apprentices in strength, both of the Zachs are still trying to gain enough weight to be classified as adult males, Sammerr aims to be a decent Olympic lifter, Sam is always begged to eat more despite his strength to bodyweight ratio, and Kyle battles horrific anthropometry.</p>
<p>I work with a lot of people here, and they all aim to get stronger (and sometimes conditioned). What gym are you at? Who else do you know that is trying to get 70’s Big? We’d like to hear about it. Eventually we’ll make an archive of gyms that are conducive to being 70’s Big.</p>
