I had never heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Paglia#Overview" target="_blank">Camille Paglia</a> before; she’s feminist that I agree with. Weird.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why the hell I’m posting about this considering this is a website dedicated to strength training. If you have followed this site for a while (or read through the extensive archive) you know that improving body image is a point of emphasis. From a male’s perspective I put an emphasis on being manly, muscular, capable, and brawny (see <a href="/blog/2013/11/be-a-god-damn-man/" target="_blank">Be A God Damn Man</a>). The emphasis on thin, hipster, goober-faced celebrities influences (stupid) young males into imitating them because (stupid) young females consider that style and body image to be attractive. I even started “revolutions” about <a href="/blog/2012/09/the-revolutionary-guide-to-manly-short-shorts/" target="_blank">short shorts</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/10/the-revolution-part-2/" target="_blank">flannel</a>, and <a href="/blog/2013/07/take-back-the-tank-tops/" target="_blank">tank tops</a> for muscular readers to make a concerted effort into exhibiting manliness against the societal norm (women can have a similar revolutionary effect just by lifting weights).</p>
<p>From a female’s perspective, I want females to spit on the idea of emaciation and starvation and understand that a strong woman is attractive, appealing, and ideal (see <a href="/blog/2013/12/what-is-sexy/" target="_blank">What is sexy?</a>). For over a year I posted a female topic every Monday to a) get women into strength training and b) facilitate their transition into a healthier body image (<a href="/blog/2012/08/peculiarities-of-female-training/" target="_blank">Peculiarities of Female Training</a> is one of many examples).</p>
<p>The point is that 70’s Big has always been concerned with gender roles in society and in relation to each other. I feel that these are related to the direction that society and America have headed; there’s a resonating theme of pussification. I don’t mean that in a “I’m a crusty old man and think everyone is a pussy,” kind of way. I mean that people are unwilling to accept any personal responsibility and want to be coddled. Hard work and busting one’s ass is an after thought, especially since somebody else will end up taking care of you anyway.</p>
<p>Technology is amazing and I love it, but people allow themselves to be enslaved by it. Nobody really <em>does</em> anything and they are content with this fact; it’s easier to provide acute entertainment with some kind of pixelated screen. I’m not against watching TV, playing videogames, or surfing the internet, but I am against complacency. I believe that no person should ever plateau and that they should continuously work to be better. They should improve their intelligence, their emotional capability, their physical prowess, their health, and so on. I try to exhibit the thirst for knowledge and success through the content on this site. There’s an agenda here, and it’s focused on your individual improvement to help the general improvement (though the latter is a lofty and possibly naive goal).</p>
<p>Whether you realize it or not, your training and lifting means <em>something.</em> Are you experiencing an eternal struggle of personal growth and introspection? How will you respond in a moment in which all of the odds favor failure? Can you summon the courage and intensity to finish that pull or to stick the jerk? Or is your training a reminder that success comes with not only a price, but a slow, grinding process that leaves your sweat and blood behind you as you step towards your goal. Or is the end product what matters; that you stand at the top of the mountain and revile in the days, the hours, the minutes that it took for you to squat 405, or 500, or 600 and so on. Or is it a tool that improves your self confidence, letting you be more bold at work or with the opposite sex? Or is it something that effects your gender role and exhibits masculinity or a powerful woman? _</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>It could be all of these things at once, and that’s why we train.</p>
<p>When I saw the originally linked interview with Camille Paglia talking about how masculinity is being stripped from American society as early as grade school, it makes me think of our place in the system. She says a lot of thought provoking things that defy conventional wisdom and “societal norms”, and I applaud her for it. I agree with her take on “‘equal-opportunity feminism’ that demands a level playing field without demanding special quotas or protections for women”. I agree with her assessment that a lack of masculinity has a massive trickle down effect that even influences corporate or governmental decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A key part of the remedy, she believes, is a “revalorization” of traditional male trades—the ones that allow women’s studies professors to drive to work (roads), take the elevator to their office (construction), read in the library (electricity), and go to gender-neutral restrooms (plumbing).</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is one of Paglia’s solution to dwindling masculinity. It’s a good idea, but one that, like most good ideas, will either not happen or will fall short. It’s an interesting thought in an interesting topic. Paglia is all over the place — the WSJ editor pointed out, “Talking to her is like a mental CrossFit workout” — but I was impressed with Paglia. Yet, after my nodding in agreement or standing ovations, I think back to wondering what we can actually do to help the problem or issue.</p>
<p>My only solution is to keep lifting weights; it solves most problems, right?</p>

  <p>Yesterday I told you to enjoy your holiday break, but to reflect on 2013’s training. Now I want to hear what it is you accomplished. Though PR Fridays have been less frequent, they historically provide a venue to talk about your own weekly improvement or personal records. Let’s face it, sometimes your wife (husband?) or co-workers just don’t give a shit or understand what it’s like to get a 10 lb deadlift PR, so sharing it with other lifters nets an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Look back over 2013 and think about what you accomplished. Did elevate your training to the next level? Did you compete? Did you experience any injuries? Let us know how it went. Training is intimately related with what else is going on in your life, so recap the non-training part of your life. Did you get married (I did), graduate, or get a new job? All of these things effect your training but also count as leveling up in life.</p>
<p>Lifting isn’t just something we do because we love it; we need to do it. It’s the great leveler, the thing that brings you back to reality or reminds you how progress requires blood and sweat. The lessons under the bar have direct application in life’s success; let us know how training has influenced your life in 2013.</p>

  <p><a href="/blog/category/content/quick-tip/" target="_blank">Quick Tip</a> #4 — Rest, But Get Your Shit Together</p>
<p>‘Tis the season of hanging out, drinking coffee out of a mug with a bear’s face on it, wearing a flannel robe, and watching the final season of Breaking Bad. Christmas holidays usually give us a chance to slow down and breathe before the new year. And that’s perfectly fine; you’ve earned it (or at least pretended to). Use this time to hydrate, sleep a lot, and eat a lot of meat; rest and digest, homie. I’d also recommend getting outside to explore, build a fire, and shoot things, but in the biz we call that a digression.</p>
<p>But as you sit there taking a dump and reading “How To Survive in the Woods”, take a few seconds to reflect on the past year’s training. Every January 70’s Big puts out a post called “Letter of Intent Day” that asks you to figure out what you want to accomplish in the coming year. Did you accomplish what you wanted to this year? What could you have done better? What physical attributes need work? By getting your shit together now, you’ll have prepped for January’s Letter of Intent.</p>
<p>Do yourself the favor of taking your vitamins, eating your protein, and resting nine hours a night while you have time off. It’ll at least help your hangover, but it’ll prep you for next year’s training. Happy Holidays, but get your shit together.</p>

  <p>I remember doing about 12 to 15 maximal reps between snatch, clean and jerk, and front squat a few years ago, and I was <em>tired</em> halfway into it. After the initial warm-ups, I would amp myself up for the maximal sets using imagery and cue words; purely psychological. I’ve increased my heart rate 50 beats per minute doing this while sitting in a chair using these methods (the pulse was obtained with a pulse oximeter).</p>
<p>It’s easy to intuitively know that “getting amped” can tire you out, but what is physiologically going on? Why is it tiring to do a lot of high intensity lifting? Or even high intensity conditioning workouts (as in CrossFit)? We can start by understanding <strong>epinephrine</strong> and <strong>norepinephrine</strong> (aka adrenaline and noradrenaline).</p>

<p>Typically epinephrine and norepinephrine are secreted by the adrenal medulla, a part of the adrenal gland that sits on the kidney, but norepinephrine is also a neurotransmitter released by neurons in the sympathetic nervous system. There are lots of smart words here, but the sympathetic nervous system is summed up as the “fight or flight” response while the parasympathetic takes care of “rest and digest”. Both are necessary for sex, or at least good sex, but I digress.</p>
<p>These hormones are amino acid based, which means they are water soluble and therefore not fat soluble. If you can remember back to your basic biology days, cellular walls are made out of a phospholipid bilayer. In other words, cell walls are made out of fats and cholesterol — which is a mega huge raging reason you need to eat quality fats in your diet, but that’s another digression.</p>
<p>Anyway, epinephrine is not fat soluble, so it can’t just pass through cell walls. Instead, it attaches on receptors on the cellular membrane and creates a chain of reactions inside that cell; a process called a <em>cascade</em>. This cascade can change a lot of stuff going on in a given cell from just a little bit of epinephrine, and that’s why it’s effective; lots of change from just a little amount.</p>
<p>The primary effects of dumping epinephrine and norepinephrine into your body are increased heart rate and blood pressure (via vasoconstriction, or narrowing of specific blood vessels), increasing respiratory rate (via bronchodilation, or making lung airways bigger), increasing blood flow to muscles (via vasodilation), increasing blood sugar levels by breaking down stored glycogen in the liver, and lastly, increasing nearly every cell’s metabolism and burning glucose and breaking down proteins and fats.</p>
<p>Well fuck, there’s a lot going on there. Basically it preps the body for some sort of intense event, like uppercutting a predator or running from prison rape (but you can’t escape; it’s prison!). The part we are more concerned with is cellular metabolism. Burning glucose and breaking down proteins and fats means getting substrates ready for lots of action, but it isn’t sustainable. These macronutrients are stored in special ways, but they need to be broken back down to be used, which uses energy. After the event, you have consumed lots of energy and don’t have stores left, so you feel tired.</p>
<p>Imagine doing this every single workout multiple times a week until further notice; it’s metabolic madness. Do you understand now why doing CrossFit six days a week or lifting with a high frequency and intensity isn’t sustainable without performance enhancement drugs?</p>
<p>Furthermore, imagine if this cascade happened routinely from psychological and emotional stress. It’s easy to see why people use the term “adrenal fatigue”. Call it whatever you want, but getting stressed physically or emotionally is the same and it messes with your body. Understanding one little cog called epinephrine in the giant metabolic machine can show us how too much exposure can be debilitating. Or at the very least you know why you’re so damn tired after amping up in training or competition.</p>

  <p>Four years ago one of the founding principles of 70’s Big was to reset the idea of body image in society. At the time, CrossFit was fairly “anti-strength training” — evidenced by HQ’s proclamation that focused strength training wasn’t necessary AND rejecting an article I wrote detailing how the “CrossFit Wichita Falls Program” (a program I wrote while at Rippetoe’s WFAC; I refer to it as “<a href="/files/Articles/Lascek_S&CP_v2.0.pdf" target="_blank">The S&amp;C Program</a>” now) made all of my trainees very much stronger while increasing their CrossFit performance. I was told it didn’t contain “measurable, repeatable data”, which it did, but that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>It was thought that the “workout of the day” was enough to increase performance and that structured programming was unnecessary and less effective. Let’s ignore these stupid fucking points and focus on the result: it was more popular to only do met-cons, and most CrossFit guys were lean and small. 70’s Big was a kind of “fuck that” to CrossFit and bodybuilding and focused on the “big because you’re strong” look. Long story short, I give less of a shit about how people train, so long as they do it intelligently and efficiently…which almost always means they should strength train.</p>
<p>The 70’s Big mentality is focused on strength, muscularity, healthiness, and being jacked because of it. When I hear bullshit about women thinking they need to lose weight in order to have “the gap” (which Mike and I talked about it in <a href="/blog/2013/11/70s-big-radio-episode-15/" target="_blank">70’s Big Radio Episode 15</a>), or how young girls think they need to weigh a certain amount to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vBpcSEdcRc" target="_blank">fit in</a>” with their friends, it drives me fucking crazy.</p>
<p><a href="/2013/12/fittingin.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9775" data-permalink="/blog/2013/12/what-is-sexy/fittingin/" data-orig-file="/2013/12/fittingin.jpg" data-orig-size="440,299" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="fittingin" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2013/12/fittingin-200x135.jpg" data-large-file="/2013/12/fittingin.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9775" alt="fittingin" src="/2013/12/fittingin.jpg" width="440" height="299" srcset="/2013/12/fittingin.jpg 440w, /2013/12/fittingin-150x101.jpg 150w, /2013/12/fittingin-200x135.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></a></p>
<p>As long as civilized society exists, people will be concerned with conforming to it. I have no god damn idea why it’s so important, but to some people it is. I’ve spent most of my life trying to do the opposite, and hopefully I can help others think the same way. It seems to me that one of the barriers in doing what <em>you</em> want to do instead of what <em>others</em> want you to do is self-confidence. Lifting weights, getting bigger, faster, and stronger can develop confidence. I’ve seen it in kids, teenagers, young adults, and older folks. Society is fucking weak. Most people get comfortable with something and stick with it. Then they feel chained to it because they <em>think</em> they can’t do anything else. They lack the confidence in themselves to make it happen.</p>
<p><a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/"><img data-attachment-id="7010" data-permalink="/books/tm-2-cover-small-3/" data-orig-file="/2012/06/TM-2-cover-small2.jpg" data-orig-size="400,517" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="TM-2-cover-small" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/06/TM-2-cover-small2-154x200.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/06/TM-2-cover-small2.jpg" class=" wp-image-7010    alignright" alt="" src="/2012/06/TM-2-cover-small2.jpg" width="101" height="130" srcset="/2012/06/TM-2-cover-small2.jpg 400w, /2012/06/TM-2-cover-small2-116x150.jpg 116w, /2012/06/TM-2-cover-small2-154x200.jpg 154w" sizes="(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px" /></a></p>
<p>Yet lifting weights can give people a little kick in the B-hole. They work their ass off to achieve a goal, and they realize that they <em>can</em> do something that previously seemed impossible. When Chris was deadlifting mid 400s for reps, and he said, “I want to deadlift 600×5,” I thought it was kind of far-fetched. But the mother fucker trained his dick off every. god. damn. week. And you know what? He eventually did it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkF7Ua6Kpk" target="_blank">watch </a>the vid and <a href="/blog/2012/04/the-evolution-of-chris/" target="_blank">read </a>about the journey; learn about the program to the right).</p>
<p>I’d like to think that people who lift have a different understanding and expectation of what is sexy and healthy. I’d like to think that a woman who lifts doesn’t give a shit about “the gap”, which I don’t even understand. Why would a guy think a space between skin is sexy? How did a bunch of weirdo-neck-beards on the internet popularize this? Some piece of shit in his cubicle at work has power over a young girl’s mind — this is truly the future. Furthermore, why do girls think they need to be skinny to have “the gap”? You take most chicks, including those with muscular legs from squatting and deadlifting, bend her over, and she’s probably going to have a gap (Note: only try this if you have female compliance). It’s called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpubic_angle" target="_blank">subpubic</a> angle, and women have a wider pelvic opening because they need to be able to drop a watermelon-sized child out of their pelvis. This is of course a _BIG _fucking digression since a space between thighs is not fucking sexy anyway; it’s probably the fact that there is a vagina sitting right above it. Let’s call a spade a spade; dudes like seeing lady parts and the gap has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>The internet is a mob, and the mob has power. I’m here to be the sniper on the clock tower picking off the mob’s leaders. The gap is a shit-head development from the mob. Instead, aesthetically confused girls (or boys) should focus on strength training and health with the byproduct of sexiness. I’ve discovered something incredibly important. Since I have that aforementioned <del>narcissism</del> self-confidence, I named it after myself.</p>
<p><a href="/2013/12/Capture.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9774" data-permalink="/blog/2013/12/what-is-sexy/capture-5/" data-orig-file="/2013/12/Capture.jpg" data-orig-size="859,460" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Justin&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1386155411&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Capture" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2013/12/Capture-200x107.jpg" data-large-file="/2013/12/Capture-450x240.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9774" alt="Capture" src="/2013/12/Capture-450x240.jpg" width="450" height="240" srcset="/2013/12/Capture-450x240.jpg 450w, /2013/12/Capture-150x80.jpg 150w, /2013/12/Capture-200x107.jpg 200w, /2013/12/Capture-500x267.jpg 500w, /2013/12/Capture.jpg 859w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>This information was garnered from a series of observations in repeated experiments in which the result is <em>always</em> the same. Of course there are other variables that are important, like conditioning (i.e. cardiovascular and respiratory training), other lifts or exercises that can fit into the “strength” equation, or other variables that define health like hydration or supplementation, but this is a simplified look at the law. It states that if you put these variables together, the result is sexiness.</p>
<p>Not to insult your intelligence, but notice there isn’t anything in there about “losing weight” or even “gaining weight”. There isn’t anything about “being able to see through someone’s legs while their feet are together”. There isn’t anything about seeing beads of oil accumulating on rippled abs. There isn’t even an opportunity to leave your sexiness up for interpretation, even to yourself. Most importantly, there is nothing in this equation that indicates someone outside of <strong>you</strong> has any control over your sexiness.</p>

Your friends do not provide a comparison to derive your hotness. People in your demographic group (i.e. gender and age) do not define your attractiveness. I’m not even giving you false hope in saying that your mindset determines your sexiness! There are fat people out there who think they are da bomb, but we all know they aren’t, so I’m not going to bullshit you into thinking you can look however you want yet feel like sexual god. I’m giving you an absolute, measurable way to determine your sexiness. How strong are you? How consistent is your training? How well do you eat (learn more to the right)? How well do you sleep? This is all quantifiable and can be recorded with any effort or OCD. If you’re gonna have a complex about your aesthetics, let it be a healthy one. Frisbee your weight scale out the window and tell the people that try to influence your body, clothes, or style to go fuck themselves. You’ll be free; you’ll be in control. Implement Lascek’s Law, because, like me, it’s never fucking wrong.</p>

  <p><em>I hope that reading about AC’s experience will inspire you to enter a local competition. Have fun and train hard. –Justin</em></p>
<p>I recently competed in the 2013 Georgia and Southern States Powerlifting Championships hosted by Josh Rohr and held at Meadow Creek High-school.</p>
<p>Started off the day well. Got roughly 7 hours of sleep the night before, which was a lot considering I was really nervous/anxious. It’s only inevitable to get some pre-game jitters. Everybody knows them well. You think about the excitement during the day of the meet. You feel that don’t you…that tingling in your balls? Big metal butterflies fluttering around your stomach? No it’s not testicular cancer; that’s your mind fucking you. Hope you’re wearing a condom.</p>
<p>Fortunately I slept well. Woke up around 6. Made my way to the meet. Checked in/Rack Heights/Equipment check. All done. I get to the scale. The guy looks at me and says 101.7. I stare blankly at him and say words Chris has spoken before “Hey man, I don’t do kilos”. He said I was over the limit. He urged me to go take a shit. I said NAY, I have already shat! The future plan is to compete as a 231 lifter at Nationals and the Arnie so I didn’t really care about weight. However this meant I was lifting at 2:30pm instead of 9:00am. Kinda fucked that one up. I re-weighed in around 12:30.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 13px;">The other flights were taking a long time to finish. A 30 min delay which turns into a 2 1/2 hour delay. This sucks if you’re waiting around trying to stay calm and keep your energy levels up. Luckily I had a great group of people there to support me. Nelson (my chiro) had some extra energy bars that HE PLANNED ON EATING. He gave them to me. I bought him a 40 dollar Chipotle gift card as a thanks (for the meet and the free chiro work).</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 13px;">Warm-up time finally rolled around. I do some quick stretching/foam rolling, then on to the bar. Squats feel good. I hit my last warm-up at 500. It feels EZ. I’m ready for the platform. My dad let’s me know that I am 3 out. I stay ready for my opening attempt. I’ve prepared for several months for this moment. An easy smooth opener to get into the meet. I’ve tripled this weight before. No problemo. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 13px;">I FUCKING MISS IT. Great. It felt off-center/mis-loaded. I almost fall backwards. I was ashamed/embarrassed. My family and friends had been waiting all day to watch me lift and I fucking blow my first attempt. Callahan and my dad say to move on. That’s exactly what I did. I ended up reducing my attempts so I could go 2/3. It was the smart move. My confidence would have been shot if I missed another one. They load it to 540 for the second attempt and I crush it. Felt much better. I take 551 after that. It was rough. Not a PR by any means, but my squats were not working that day. A guy named Chris was one of the spotters; he was a real cool dude. He follows 70’s Big along with some other great guys I met. He was right there in the thick of it trying to help and motivate me. It’s great to meet dudes like that.</span></p>

</p>
<p>I talk to Shawn during my breather in between Squat/Bench. Even though my squats didn’t go according to plan, we agreed I was the best looking guy in the building.</p>
<p>Time to bench. It feels way better from the start. As the meet moved on I felt my body and mind working together. We loaded the bar to 350 for my last warm-up. Joke. I go out to the platform with 374 loaded. Blasted it. My abs started to cramp, and I think it was due to some dehydration. I thought I had diluted my Powerade enough, but yeah I was fucking wrong. I take 391 for my second attempt. I was concerned about cramping up at this point. 391 is a PR and even though I’ve done more in the gym the goal was to PR during the meet. My abs cramp even more. Callahan gives me a lift off. I kill it. The commands were loud and quick. I wave my third attempt Bench because I was concerned about cramping. I really wanted to hit 402 on my third attempt and I think I would have been good for it, but I wanted to save myself for deadlifting in case I cramped. At this point in the day this is not where I pictured myself, but sometimes you have to roll with it and make adjustments.</p>

<p>I try to stay calm during my warm-ups. My dad knows I am on the verge of an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqUk28OwHs">emotional eruption</a>. He tells me one word when he sees me. Calm. Over and over. I did 500 as my opener. It felt like nothing. My dad puts in 550. He looks at me and he says with a smile on his face “One more then let it all loose”. I’m trying not to cry. Not sure why I need to get upset in order to rage out. It’s mainly a huge stress relief for me. It’s just the way I get pumped up. I take 550 and it feels even better. I turn and look at him and say “Welcome to the fucking show”. I’m in a haze at this point. He says something along the lines of “We are at the show now baby”. My dad is all smiles. He puts in 600. I find a song to play before I am 3 out. Before I know it my dad puts his hand up. He is holding up three of his fingers. I tighten my shoes, pull my socks up, and tighten my belt. I walk over the the line and put on Dom’s death scene from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEq0oV21tHI">Gears of War 3</a>. The music times out perfectly. The head judge looks at me and gives me the thumbs up. Right when he does it the sound fades and Dom says “<a href="http://youtu.be/lEq0oV21tHI">Never thought it would end like this, huh? Huh, Maria?</a>“. The first piano strike of Gary Jules’ Mad World hits. Marcus screams “Dom no!”. I can’t stop crying. I scream and rush the bar. This was a moment in the making for over a year. The set-up is perfect. I grab the bar and it was perfectly smooth all the way up. I scream in excitement once it is gliding past my knees. It’s a huge meet PR for me. I let it down after the command and I scream again and hug my dad. Exactly how I wanted to end my day.</p>
<p>For the delays and the changes in weight class I had a great time. I couldn’t have had any better handlers and people supporting me. I went 7/8. 551/391/600. A total of 1542. Placed 1st in the 242’s and I got 75 bucks for placing 3rd overall at the meet. I can’t thank everyone enough. Thanks to everyone who follows 70’s Big. Wish we could train with all of you!</p>

  <p>In Robert Heinlein’s <em>Starship Troopers</em>, the Terran Federation is a limited democracy in which full citizenship comes with a price. Earning citizenship and suffrage — the right to vote — was accomplished by two years of voluntary Federal Service (AKA military service). The concept that a society be made of people who have contributed to their country and government was important to Heinlein, who served in the Navy after graduating from the Naval Academy. Earning that voice in government, in Heinlein’s eyes, is better than anyone “who is 18 years old and has a body temperature near 37 °C.”</p>
<p>The idea that veterans are deeply rewarded for their sacrifice is an admirable one; something that would inspire appreciation for gained freedoms and instill a foundation of work ethic. In our society, veterans make analogous sacrifices. First, they pledge an allegiance to uphold the longstanding tradition of morals and honor of their respective country. Second, they knowingly surrender various birth-given rights and are held to a higher standard for their actions. Third, they play their specific role in an organization that provides and maintains the security of freedom for all countrymen. And fourth, they do so with meager compensation and the occasional “thank you.”</p>

<p>Some might say that the veteran has chosen their fate; their own volition led them into their job just as a civilian has chosen theirs. Yet the difference is that veteran made that decision knowing what was at stake. The Airman who works on jets or the Ranger who puts two rounds into a terrorist consciously made a decision that subjects them to the needs of their respective branch. They chose to reduce their freedom so that you and I can under appreciate ours.</p>
<p>Many of you will feel noble on these holidays by publicly saying, “Thank you, troops,” but your words will only accomplish so much. Your support does mean something to a veteran, but you can do so much more with action. While all service members sacrifice, some leave war with mental or physical scars while others return home in a casket draped with their flag. What remains is a person struggling to cope, whether it be with what they could have done to save their best friend or how to move on without their spouse in their life.</p>
<p>70’s Big and I ask you to do more than just speak words today. I ask you to donate $1 to two foundations: <a href="https://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/default.aspx?tsid=66&campaignSource=WEBSITE&source=ONLINE" target="_blank">The Wounded Warrior Project</a> and <a href="http://www.specialops.org/" target="_blank">The Special Operations Warrior Foundation</a>. Both are legitimate organizations that help veterans or their remaining families in a variety of ways (read their mission statements <a href="http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/mission.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.specialops.org/?page=MissionStatement" target="_blank">here</a> respectively). I make no apology for asking you to donate your hard-earned, well deserved money; I know it’s hard to come by in today’s economy, yet show your thanks to these veterans with action. I can tell you that veterans, including the fallen or disabled, are powerlifters, weightlifters, strength trainees, CrossFitters, bodybuilders, and S&amp;C enthusiasts. They are husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, and friends. Some of them need more than words and we have the ability to help them. $1 for each charity is all I ask for you to show that you truly support your troops (<em>Update: The Special Operations Warrior Foundation has a $10 minimum)</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/default.aspx?tsid=66&campaignSource=WEBSITE&source=ONLINE" target="_blank">Donate to The Wounded Warrior Project here. </a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.specialops.org/" target="_blank">Donate to The Special Operations Warrior Foundation here. </a></p>
<p>(Non-American countries can post equivalent charity foundations in the comments)</p>
<p>Thank you to current and past veterans for making the choice to serve your country at the expense of limiting the most important values of all: freedom and liberty.</p>

  <p>PR Friday — Post training updates, PR’s, and what you are going to do to become more of a man in the comments (read this post first).</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tip #3 — Be A God Damn Man</strong></p>
<p>Look, I know the website has been in anaphylaxis. Shit ain’t the same, right? Well that’s fucking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4psKYpfnYs" target="_blank">BULLSHIT</a>. We need some adrenaline injected into our veins. We needed to be reminded of why we’re here. I’m loaded up on copious amounts of coffee and am listening to heavy metal. No, not the pussy-ass new-age shit like Disturbed that predicates itself on being angry at their mom for catching them wanking into their favorite tube sock. I’m talking about Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, possibly some <strong>Mötley Crüe</strong>. Grit, attitude, and uppercuts.</p>
<p>You know, the qualities that make a god damn Man. But what is a man?</p>
<p><em>What makes a man, is it the power in his hands?</em></p>
<p><em>Is it his quest for glory?</em></p>
<p><em>Give it all you’ve got, to fight to the top,</em></p>
<p>_So we can know your story.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://youtu.be/851BqHMCaeM" target="_blank">Now You’re A Man</a>_</p>
<p><a href="/2013/11/7891840.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9745" data-permalink="/blog/2013/11/be-a-god-damn-man/attachment/7891840/" data-orig-file="/2013/11/7891840.jpg" data-orig-size="378,442" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="7891840" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2013/11/7891840-171x200.jpg" data-large-file="/2013/11/7891840.jpg" class="alignleft  wp-image-9745" src="/2013/11/7891840.jpg" alt="7891840" width="265" height="309" srcset="/2013/11/7891840.jpg 378w, /2013/11/7891840-128x150.jpg 128w, /2013/11/7891840-171x200.jpg 171w, /2013/11/7891840-256x300.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" /></a>What a nice summary. A man <em>fights for glory.</em> He’s doing everything he can to beat the FUCKING SHIT out of every day to meet his goals, to be successful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPVLyB0Yc6I" target="_blank">A wiser feller than myself once said</a>, “Sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes the bar eats you.” That means some days you’ll get elbow dropped from the top rope. But a man — a true hairy-chested sexual Tyrannosaurus — will wipe the blood and shame off his brow, get up, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asHnD75LG5E" target="_blank">shake the top rope</a> like an asshole, and <a href="http://youtu.be/7tfyLbin9gs" target="_blank">get in the ring</a> one more time. That’s what a man is.</p>
<p>Why is it so important to be a man? Aside from the intuitive notion that being a man is just, true, and innate, it’s the desire for success that makes it important. Life is a wonderfully beautiful thing; to sit idle like the oily surface of a swamp is a crime. Criminal is the man who doesn’t who doesn’t constantly strive for success, who doesn’t crave experience, and who doesn’t want it all. Criminal are the timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.</p>
<p>Are you on the path to getting whatever the hell it is that you want? If you could be doing more, then you need to slam your fist down onto a hard wood table, lift the table up to the heavens, and then break it in half over your head. Take these lumber pieces and light them on fire. Breathe the smoke before screaming as loud as you can. This will increase your testosterone levels by 37% and immediately make you more attractive to the opposite sex (women love the smell of “outside”).</p>
<p>Now get on track. What do you want to be? Need to be? What challenges sit between you and manliness? I understand some of you can’t just quit your job or family to try and choke slam your truest desire; that’s why 70’s Big is here for you. Because at the very least you can step into a weight room, load the bar, and move some god damn iron. Getting stronger requires commitment and desire. It’s never-ending; you can’t be “too strong”. It teaches the mentality that meeting your goals is hard, grinding work, but you can face each step with an animalistic intensity. You know that <em>attacking</em> the bar is more successful than just trying to move it. Your mindset before each session, set, and repetition is going to dictate how badly you destroy it. The same concept applies to life; attack your non-lifting goals with the same berserking intensity and you’ll have a hard time failing.</p>

Have you been lifting in the gym for a year? Sign up for a meet and put your ass on the line. Bored with your job? Fucking <em>do</em> something about it. Be innovative, create your own job, make your company better, or say, “Fuck it,” and do something else.</p>
<p>Everybody has something locked away in their mind that they wish they would have done or wish they had the balls to try. Go and do it. Explore the world, compete, and challenge yourself. If life takes a fat shit on you (as it often does), wipe it off, get back up, and keep striding forward. Be a god damn man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>_Post a comment about what you are going to do in order to be more of a man — NOT what you are already doing, but something that you can and will do in the future. _</p>
