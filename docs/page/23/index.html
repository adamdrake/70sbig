<p>I wear short shorts, and I yell “TEARDROP!” at awkward moments in romantic comedies.</p>
<p>I completely deny having ever gone to a single romantic comedy.</p>
<p>I’m not going to apologize for having fun, especially while lifting things up and putting them down. And neither should you. Next time you go to the gym, recreate this scene during your warmups. You’ll be a better man/woman for it:</p>

<p>And if not, well, hopefully you don’t get kicked out.</p>
<p>This week, Aaron wrote <a href="/blog/2013/03/70s-big-attitude-2/" target="_blank">another article</a> that I personally thought was fan-fucking-tastic. Some people probably didn’t think so. Those people aren’t having enough fun. The point of this site is to help each other get stronger, leaner, meaner, and more awesomer, just like our long lost brothers did back in the 70s. Think they apologized? Nope.</p>
<p>This site has become an awesome community, and continues to evolve into something bigger than Justin or any of us ever imagined when it was launched. We get more daily hits than ever before, and our sphere of influence continues to grow. Hell, big ol’ Mark Bell even mentioned us this week on his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDv-C3Xtb2A" target="_blank">youtubes</a> (if you don’t follow his selfie-vids, do it now – he’s full of great info and stupid hats). Take pride in being a part of this group, and make sure you comment here, especially on PR Fridays like today. Stop lurking, and start contributing. If you’d like to keep a workout log or ask questions, you can join the <a title="Go here and register. " href="http://liftheavyshit.com/forum/" target="_blank">LiftHeavyShit</a> forums (NWS, duh), or hit us up on facebook. Tsypkin answers questions every Thursday, mostly about CrossFit and Olympic Weightlifting. This week, <a href="/mike/" target="_blank">Mike</a> took a huge chunk of time to answer every question he could find on the facebooks in this video:</p>

<p><strong>David C asks, “If you were going to hire/follow one of the bigger CrossFit coaches out there to help you prepare for the Open, Regionals, and Games, who would you choose?”</strong></p>
<p>Rudy Nielsen of Outlaw.  In part because he has a deep and sound understanding of how to program effectively – but there are a lot of people with that. What Rudy has that a lot of others lack, is a deep and sound understanding of how CrossFit – the SPORT, not the fitness program – functions. He doesn’t debate silly shit like “is CrossFit too strength biased” or “has too much cardio” or whether the “definition of fitness” is legit.  He observes the parameters of the sport, and trains people to compete in them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Dave F asks, “I am training the Olympic lifts three times a week, one day being committed to the snatch, one day to the clean &amp; jerk, and one to both. What is a good rep scheme for a novice?”</strong></p>
<p>First: if you are a novice, I do NOT think that 2x/week per lift is enough. You need to be doing them 3x/week so that you can learn the patterns and learn them well.</p>
<p>About rep schemes…don’t worry about them. Focus on sets of 1-3, get a lot of good reps in, and when you feel great, go for a new PR, whether it be a single, double, or triple. If you’re training alone, don’t do so much that you are exhausted for the last third of your session and do nothing but shitty reps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vee G asks “I was trained using the ‘scoop method’ ala Coach Burgener.  A lot of my fellow weightlifters have been taught in a style more similar to Coach Pendlay’s, which does not teach the scoop. What are some advantages/disadvantages of either technique?”</strong></p>
<p>I’m assuming that by the “scoop method,” you mean teaching an intentional rebending of the knees – sometimes referred to as the double knee bend – under the bar before the second pull.</p>
<div id="attachment_8926" style="width: 159px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
  <a href="/blog/2013/03/tsypkin-thursdays-4/scoop/" rel="attachment wp-att-8926"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8926" data-attachment-id="8926" data-permalink="/blog/2013/03/tsypkin-thursdays-4/scoop/" data-orig-file="/2013/03/scoop.jpg" data-orig-size="299,399" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="scoop" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2013/03/scoop-149x200.jpg" data-large-file="/2013/03/scoop.jpg" class="size-medium wp-image-8926" src="/2013/03/scoop-149x200.jpg" alt="" width="149" height="200" srcset="/2013/03/scoop-149x200.jpg 149w, /2013/03/scoop-112x150.jpg 112w, /2013/03/scoop-224x300.jpg 224w, /2013/03/scoop.jpg 299w" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" /></a>
  <p id="caption-attachment-8926" class="wp-caption-text">
    Did someone say scoop method?
  </p>
</div>
<p>I personally do not teach the scoop/double knee bend as such. I teach the lifter to move into the correct position, and the knees move into the right spot – slightly in front of the bar – just before the lifter extends into the finish. It is my opinion that teaching the intentional double knee bend only serves to confuse new lifters, slow down the transition, and lead to the lifter pushing the bar forward and shifting the weight onto the front of the feet too early.</p>
<p>Although there are certainly good coaches who have made this method work, I cannot see any advantages this way of teaching has over those which do not coach the lifter to intentionally perform the double knee bend.</p>
<p>_Editors’s Note: Please remember to ask Tsypkin anything your crazy little heart desires on our <a title="it's facebook, silly" href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">facebook</a> page. Otherwise, he’s going to have to come up with his own questions to answer, and that would just be crazy. _</p>

  <p><em>Aaron is a PJ, or pararescue jumper, as well as a general badass. He’s already written a couple inspiring articles for us (<a href="/blog/2013/02/excuses-no/" target="_blank">Excuses? No</a>. and <a href="/blog/2013/01/lessons-from-lifting/" target="_blank">Lessons From Lifting</a>). In this one, perhaps his best yet, he has a call to arms. Are you ready to answer? Ladies and Not-so-Gentlemen, are you ready for some old-school 70sBig? – Cloud</em></p>
<p>Three years ago I was drawn to this site by the unapologetic, brash braggadocio only a true miscreant could love. Idolizing forgotten mastodons wearing <a href="/blog/2012/09/the-revolutionary-guide-to-manly-short-shorts/" target="_blank">short shorts</a> and high socks. Celebrating facial hair and real meals, encouraging real men and women to be real men and women in a time of androgyny, man-scaping, skinny jeans, Twilight, and other things so horrible they shall go unmentioned. Like 50 Shades of Grey. Those things are not cool, bro, and like my personal heroes Michael Douglas, General Patton, Tyler Durden, Vlad the Impaler, the Techno Viking (that guy took ZERO shits), John W. Creasy, and Walter- this aggression will not stand, man.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/2009/09/dougyoung-395x400.jpg" alt="" width="395" height="400" /></p>
<p>In the movie “The Rock”, voted “the best movie of all time in the history of the world” by NATO and the Illuminati, it was said, “sometimes the tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots.” <strong>Well sometimes the tree of 70sBig must be replenished with the fuel of attitude, with the liquid reduction of our resolve.</strong> In the interest of re-focusing ourselves, I charge you to live your life a little more recklessly this next week. Just for a while, think to yourself, “<a href="/hall-of-fame/ricky-bruch/" target="_blank">What would Ricky Bruch do</a>?” I assure you, that answer is almost always, “Get extra mayonnaise, lift some heavy shit like a damn boss, and proceed to not give a shit, two monkeys or a damn.” Would Ricky pass up an extra conditioning session? Absolutely not. Would Ricky pass up the 4th steak in 2 meals? <a title="The pain train is comin!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzToNo7A-94" target="_blank">Not up in here.</a> Would Ricky wear long, pleated slacks and watch NASCAR drinking a light beer at a tofu tasting party, politely discussing HOA fees? I just got a phone call – the message was, “Ricky Bruch’s estate wants to kill your family for associating his name with that scenario.” It’s that serious.</p>
<p>“But Aaron! I am entrenched in the corporate world; I can’t go stomping around like a heathen, shirtless, scaring the villagers! Also, I don’t know any villagers and my shorts are of an acceptable length for ‘casual Friday’.” Well, first of all, that’s unacceptable. If you say “Casual Friday”, you better be ready for aviator shades and some damn boat shoes. If that’s not the case, it’s time to get your swole back. It’s time to remember who we all are, at our base. Boil us down to brass tacks, twisted steel and ball bearings, and we all realize several immutable, undeniable, irrefutable facts.</p>
<p>We are human. That makes us all physiologically the same, genetically capable of tasks very much the same. If you are reading this saying, “Well, X person is bigger, stronger, I don’t think that’s totally correct…” STOP IT. That’s half the problem. Who’s to say you can’t do anything you want? Me? You? Anyone? What if you just refused to believe impossible things, and simply did them? That wouldn’t make you a superhuman; it would simply mean you refuse to be limited. Do you really have limits? Do you think that’s air your breathing? That’s a Matrix reference. Keep up.</p>
<p>Slap anyone that uses the term “swag”, either ironically or seriously, right in the gob. They know better. Go to YouTube, and look up every video of Leonid Taranenko clean and jerking 266KG, then cook a damn steak and do some mobility. Disagree with someone. Seriously, get into an argument, and instead of worrying how their feelings will recover, wondering how you’ll be viewed, so on and so forth- just disagree. Tell someone they are wrong, and that you don’t agree with what they are saying, and that you won’t be wavering. If the term “agree to disagree” is uttered, wage total war and destroy the room. The world understands. That phrase is about 10% of the problem today. So help me Zeus, if anyone around you says “YOLO” and you do not immediately beat him or her to death, I will find your house and mail you a strongly worded letter.</p>
<p>Here is the hard truth- there are no trophies for 5th place, no consolation prize in real life. It does pay to be a winner, and too often in today’s environment it has become acceptable to trivialize a loss, to rationalize poor effort, to soften heartbreak. Well I am here to call bullshit. If you work hard, you get rewarded. If you don’t work hard, you lose, and you don’t get a prize for that. I don’t know when ‘Murica, – the home of first place, the inventor of competition for everything, the bastion of bacon-wrapped-filets and filet-wrapped-bacon-filled-deep-fried-chocolate-coated-turducken-sandwiches became OK with second place, but I am here to tell you it stops now, and it stops with each and every one of us. It starts with me, and it starts with you.</p>
<p>So this week, get up early. Stop making excuses for yourself, and stop taking excuses from others. Get to work early. Put out as a friend, spouse, significant other, parent, older sibling, citizen, WHATEVER. Stop living your life only to keep breathing and start attacking it. Look for every excuse to get better, and get nasty about it. Are you a lady that wants to get “more toned” and look “better this summer?” Get your lady parts underneath a damn bar and do something about it right the hell now. The world is, quite frankly, not ready for that jelly, and I want more ladies bootyliscious when the sun shines bright and hot in 3 months. Are you a fella that can grow a sweet ass beard, or at least a somewhat child molestor-ish mustache, yet shave every day? By the light in Kate Upton’s eyes, grow that damn facial hair, and do it while you grill some meat and write out your week of programming. Is there a charity, a group, or an organization that is worthy of your time that you haven’t volunteered for? What are you, some sort of sissy?

<p>If you haven’t torn up in the gym, so motivated that you wanted to literally explode into a ball of flame, or flipped a table in public only to be applauded for your gusto, or uppercut a punkass into a bowl of punch at a high school dance lately – well, dammit, now is the time (<em>editor’s note, please avoid high school dances, thank you</em>).</p>
<p>Now is the time we take back that attitude, and seize life by the horns/balls/ovaries. The part you grab isn’t important, the fact remains that we must grab that part by force. It’s time to get that 70s Big attitude back. And the time starts now.</p>

  <p>It’s Friday! This week on the site Paul Sousa <a href="/blog/2013/03/18/">reviewed a new android app called deep squatter</a>. On Tuesday we had SOF Olpainless reflect on<a href="/blog/2013/03/19/"> his experiences with training while deployed</a>, and then on Thursday Darth Tsypkin <a href="/blog/2013/03/21/">answered more of your questions</a></p>

<p>Going forward, <a href="/mike/">Mike Battaglino</a> will be answering reader submitted questions on topics such as Powerlifting, Strongman, Military related training, declining spots, etc. in a video format. Questions can be submitted to <a href="mailto:mike@70sbig.com">mike@70sbig.com</a> or posted in the comments on facebook. Mike answered a few questions already, posted on our facebook page this week:</p>
<p><strong>Michael asks:</strong>  <strong><span style="font-size: 14px">I’m a Marine and I love powerlifting (just competed in my first meet) but I need to temporarily focus on dropping my 3 mile run time for a PFT. What are your suggestions for strength maintenance while I start running long enough to do well on the fitness test? I’m planning on throwing together a mix of interval/tempo work and the occasional longer run (2-3 miles). Probably 3-4 days a week of running. I’m sure this is a pretty common scenario for the military folk.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mike: I’m quite glad my PT test days are over. I would reccomend trying to maintain your current program the best that you can, and just keep the weights the same for 4-6 weeks. If you need to, drop some of the accessory lifts. You shouldn’t lose a tremendous amount of strength, and you can be back to adding weight 1-2 weeks after the test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">I wouldn’t worry about moving the weights up for either your volume or intensity days. Perhaps for your bench and press you can move up slowly, but I would just worry about passing the test, and maintaining your current numbers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Kyp asks: <span style="font-size: 14px"> I recently bought a yoke and it’s supposed to be arriving sometime this week so figure I would study up on it in the mean time. I was wondering if you would be able to share any knowledge/know of any particularly good sources or information regarding programming yoke walks for somebody trying to get 70’s big, and have a good base of general conditioning?</span></strong></p>
<p>Mike: Kyp, I have read a quite a few pro strongman training logs, and everyone seems to program it a bit differently. I’ve only had my yoke for about six months, but I would recommend keeping it light for a little while. If you could manage to do it once a week, you would probably develop your technique pretty quickly, but keep it relatively light. Once it starts to get heavy, do it every other week. If you’re going into a contest where you’re going to use the yoke, consider programming speed/heavy days with it. I think the most important thing is to develop skill walking with it. Watch videos of pro strongman using it and experiment with what works for you (particularly hand placement).</p>

<p><strong>Tom O asks, “I have calf pain when squatting ass-to-grass, whether back, front, or overhead.  Any ideas what this could be/what I can do about it?”</strong></p>
<p>Could be quite a few things.  I’d start with soft tissue and mobility work on the hamstrings, IT band, and calves.  Start at the largest crossed joint (hips for hamstrings and IT band, knee for calves) and work down.  You may also want to do some compression work around your calves.  Finally, address the squat (and the hips) as a whole.  Do some range of motion testing (there is a lot of good stuff on Mobility WOD for this) and see where you’re limited.  Address those issues and see where it leads.  Perhaps of greatest importance, is to remember that dealing with issues like this is not a quick fix, one-and-done kind of deal.  It’s going to take some time and patience, but it will pay off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>David H asks, “I’m a new weightlifter and I have long arms.  Should I utilize a wide grip on the jerk? I’ve been using a relatively narrow grip and it feels more solid this way, but I can’t help but think I’d benefit from moving my hands out.”</strong></p>
<p>If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p>

<p><strong>Harry S asks, “What are some ways to improve my mobility for the snatch? My bottom position looks like a low bar back squat due to tight hips and ankles, and the couch stretch alone isn’t covering it.”</strong></p>
<p>In answering this, I’m going to assume you are already back squatting high bar.  If you’re not, fix that, train it for 6 weeks, and see where you’re at.  Second, while mobility and stretching is great, I’m a firm believer that the biggest changes are going to happen from doing a lot of the movement you’re trying to improve.  <strong>Don’t become that guy who spends 2 hours on mobility and 20 minutes lifting</strong> (<em>emphasis added by me because this is a glorious statement. – Cloud</em>). With that out of the way, let’s talk about a few excellent drills to help you with this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This one is very specifically helpful for people with your problem: take a length of PVC or broomstick and go into the bottom of your overhead squat.  Have someone stand behind you, hands on the PVC, place their knee in your low back, and push your hips forward and down. Be sure to keep your weight on your heels as the knees go forward, and actively push up against the “bar.”  Have your helper push down slightly on the PVC – this will help you feel something to push up against.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding an empty barbell in your hands, squat down and place the bar across your thighs/knees. Push one knee forward at a time (it’s fine to come off your heel) and use the bar to weigh you down at the knee.  You should feel a deep stretch around the achilles tendon.  Do this a little at a time, switching back and forth between legs, gradually loosening up the tissues and pushing the stretch further.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Barry S asks, “What are the pros and cons of using a percentage based training program for weightlifting?”</strong></p>
<p>This is a big question. I will address it as concisely as possible.</p>
<p>Using percentages can be helpful because it gives you a governor.  When done intelligently, in the long term, it can help keep you from doing too much or too little, ensure that you’re mostly working with loads that are beneficial to you, and give you an accurate measurement of the total training load from day to day, week to week, and month to month.</p>
<p>However, they can also be limiting. Is 80% as valuable as 85% or 90%? In my opinion, if you are having a good training day, you’re going to get more out of taking the weight up and working heavier than just sticking to a set number.  And it’s always good to have the opportunity to strike when the iron is hot and set new PRs.</p>
<p>This is not to say that a percentage based program can’t work.  There are obviously a lot of great lifters and coaches who use percentages.  And I think they can be useful for someone who is training alone, to mitigate burnout and keep the lifter from getting to the point where they’re so exhausted that they are no longer able to recognize and correct mistakes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Dave F asks, “If you were to design a program for someone looking to compete in both weightlifting and powerlifting, what would you emphasize?”</strong></p>
<p>This is another big question, not one I can address effectively within the scope of this post.  But I will say this: I very strongly believe that in order to be successful at both weightlifting and powerlifting, one would need to emphasize weightlifting as the main discipline. The short version of the long answer to the question “why?” is this: weightlifting has the potential to improve you as a powerlifter far more than powerlifting has the potential to improve you as a weightlifter. There is already great importance placed on squatting and pulling strength, and the bench press can be treated as a supplementary exercise for a large part of the year.  I would, obviously, shift emphasis closer to a powerlifting meet for the final preparatory period.</p>

  <em>Olpainless, one of our faithful readers and Justin&#8217;s good friends, submitted this introduction article to me awhile ago, and I apologize for the delay in publishing it. I initially wanted some media to go along with it, but realized his message is in the words &#8211; no pretty pictures are needed. He shares with us his whirlwind of program-hopping and diet-experiments before he consulted with Justin and started lifting and eating in a healthy, goal-oriented manner. He shares this info with us humbly, but as you read this from your couch, imagine going through all of this while deployed, away from all the comforts and conveniences of home. Imagine working your ass off to not only survive, but to improve your health and body in the most ascetic conditions. Then get off your couch, put away the Cheetos, and go lift some heavy shit. Thank you, Olpainless. Cheers. &#8211; Jacob </em>

<p> </p>
<p>Hello, fellow carcass-eating-lifting-enthusiasts.</p>
<p>I’m writing under my user name because I thought it would be easier for a couple of work reasons. I met Justin at one of his seminars a couple of years ago, at which point I realized why I had a recurring lower back injury: because I was squatting like a constipated sloth. The path that led me to Justin’s seminar was a typical one. Former CrossFitter, bumbling around with internet programs not really knowing what I was doing. I’ll summarize how it happened.</p>
<p>I realized I needed to get stronger prior to my SOF selection, I was running a lot when the opportunity came up and I was pretty skinny. My standard body building style program from the military PTI worked pretty well for a while, and got me strong enough for selection (obviously I did a lot of other training also). On a shared hard drive in Afghanistan I found a program from a guy called Ross Enamait (whose stuff I still love), CrossFit programs, and various other info. I started with something I knew I could do well, the high intensity interval style circuit training, which is nothing new. I noticed that the new ideas and workouts I found on the internet gave me great challenges and variety. The Olympic lifts and even the basic lifts were still a bit daunting for me because I’d never really had any coaching in them. Unfortunately, this experimentation resulted in a right knee injury from heavy lunges and squats with bad form.</p>
<p>It became pretty apparent I wasn’t strong enough overall. I was pretty fast and agile, could do a few party trick movements, but needed to carry heavy weight on my back which demands strength.</p>
<p>So I switched gears to a program the guys I worked with in the SOF community found – Military Athlete by Rob Shaul. I started to see some real gains for the first six months but I combined the training (which is high volume) with a low carb paleo diet. Why? Because I am an idiot, that’s why, and I speak of this to caution any of you from doing the same. From what I’ve seen on this site, most of you seem smarter than that. Rob’s training is legit and I’d recommend checking it out if you’re in the military. However, for me personally I found the volume too much to do it year round (note: I was eating low carb as well). I also tried to make my own programs based on Rob’s but doing the wrong exercises with the wrong volume.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, 3 x 8 deadlifts at 90% 1RM twice a week later, I hurt my back (“No shit!” I hear you say). Yep, well I thought I knew what I was doing; I didn’t. Meanwhile, I’m eating paleo on operations overseas, dealing with gastro symptoms from the gluten in the MREs, and losing weight (I have shitting stories but you don’t want to hear that). I thought I was training and eating smart. I wasn’t. It all came to a head when I nearly fell out on a long extraction march with a heavy pack. I had never, ever come close to falling out from my team before and I took a good hard look at myself. I learned some valuable lessons.</p>
<p>So I saw Justin’s seminar and got some coaching tips. I rehabbed the shit out of my back with mobility drills, a lacrosse ball and PVC pipe, and I started upping the carbs in the diet.</p>
<p>Since I got some coaching on how to lift from Justin, I have not had a serious injury. I believe most of this is due to the fact I have focused more on lifting and mobility and added endurance/speed work when I needed to.</p>
<p>I’d summarize what I’ve learned so far as follows (lower your expectations, this will may be underwhelming):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>     Get a coach to look at your lifts, even online coaching is better than none.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>     Program to what you need to improve, not what you’re already good at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>     Strength is vital to every other aspect of your game. If you neglect mistress Strength, she is a jealous bitch and will make you pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>     Paleo diet works great for me, but don’t go low carb unless you have a specific and valid reason to do so (and preferably get advice on how to do it from someone who has experience).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>     Don’t take programs off the internet and modify them. See point 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m currently training for an ultra marathon, which should definitely draw some heat from Brent, Chris and the regulars (and I welcome the smack talk). It’s a bucket list thing. I’m doing one and one only. I’m still lifting though.</p>
<p>The Paleo Chronicles are another post, if anyone cares to hear about that. Given Justin has just written a book, I’d start with that.</p>
<p>Looking forward to some posts from you other guys/girls who read the site. Some real strong, fit people read this resource and I learn a lot from all you guys.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

  <p><em>We received a message from Developer Johan of <a href="http://jumisapps.com/blog/">Jumisapps</a> about a new Android app he developed called Deep Squatter. This app measures your squat depth through the angle of your leg, and gives you feedback at the end of your set (unless <a href="http://youtu.be/x5xXsdWRaFw?t=8m38s">It’s still your MF’ing set</a>, then I guess you won’t see it.) Our unofficial official 70’s Big app tester Paul Sousa put it though it’s paces last week and weighs in here:</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/h4s28FUlCZDMLkgeZPkb3oqbs4vyW0jZ8PQy4r3nma5Y5DAShJWNYQV9l10Q35xgm8j2=w705" alt="" width="451" height="220" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
  Forget politics or religion, the most divisive subject on the planet is squat depth.  Well, if you own an Android smartphone you can now have proof of your depth to shove in the faces of all your Youtube critics.  Developer Jumisapps has released an app named Deep Squatter that aims to let you know if you truly are a deep squatter, or if you’re more like Marotta at the Arnold (too soon?).
</p>
<p>The concept behind it is simple, in the app you set your desired reps and the depth you want to reach in degrees with 90 degrees being parallel.  You can also set whether you want to have a beep or vibration when you hit your desired depth on each rep (I had both turned on and could barely notice the vibration, and couldn’t hear the sound at all).  Once you begin squatting the app tracks your reps and depth, and upon completion of your set it will show how many reps you completed and the depth.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  It would be nice to be able to see specific info for each rep though, instead of what seems to be either just the info from the last rep or an overall average (not sure which it is).  There is also a rumor that the developer will be adding the ability to track speed which could prove very useful, especially to those who use dynamic work in their programs.
</p>
<p>Overall I think it’s a cool concept executed pretty well.  Some minor enhancements to allow for more detailed information would go a long way, but even as is I would recommend it for anyone who is curious about their depth.</p>

  <p>This week in 70sBigVille, we discussed how, like it or not, CrossFit is impacting the strength world in big ways. Not only are there a million more ladies wearing Lulu tights, <a title="Click here, get gainz" href="/blog/2013/03/some-truths-about-crossfit-and-weightlifting/" target="_blank">there’s also a huge spike in the interest of weightlifting as a sport</a>. Tsypkin wrote up a good post, then trolled a bit imo, and a good time was had by all. Or most, at least. Maybe. Continue arguing below if you think that’s a productive use of your time (vs. more curls).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mike B wrote up an <a title="Click here if you want to live" href="/blog/2013/03/interview-with-mike-jenkins/" target="_blank">interview with Mike Jenkins</a>, large human and competitive Strongman. Strongman as a sport represents a lot of what 70sBig is all about – moving around heavy things and having fun doing it. Mention your latest feats of strength in the comments. I’ll be at a SM contest in San Antonio tomorrow cheering on some brothers. If you know of any events in the near future, mention those, too, and I’ll award you multiple bonus points. These interviews are getting a good reception, so I hope you’re ready for next week – Tsypkin scored a discussion with <a title="Niko is Awesome" href="http://www.garageinkpowerteam.com/Garage-Ink-Lifters.html" target="_blank">Niko</a>. Boom.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, we had a 2-part series of Articles by Bert and Marijke (<a title="Part 1" href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-one/" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, <a title="Part 2" href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-two/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>). Bert was kind enough to send me an update, because they’ve both competed again since then. How many times have you competed this year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Jacob, Thought I’d keep you informed.</p>
<p>Last Saturday Marijke and I competed again and she did 72,5 (2,5KG PR) – 35 (matched previous meet PR) – 80 (10 kg PR).</p>
<p>Right after the first Platform was done, a judge DEMANDED that she tried extra-wide sumo and she pulled 90kgs x 2 (so a 20 kg deadlift PR in a month!)</p>
<p>Here’s the compilation of our lifts. Her training changed slightly and she also lost 2 kilograms between last contest (2nd of February) and this one (2nd of March), weighing 53,3kgs last Saturday.</p>
<p>Kind regards and lots of courage for your lady friend and her training as well!</p>

<p>THIS.IS.AWESOME! I love this stuff. Guys and gals, please keep sending me updates like this. I love it. Also, if anyone wants to come yell at me in foreign languages, I’m pretty sure it’ll add 50 pounds to my total. Thanks ahead of time.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet, check out the forums at <a title="#WINNING" href="http://liftheavyshit.com/forum/" target="_blank">LiftHeavyShit.com</a>. I started it with a buddy of mine after a long night of drinking (and some lifting) and it has evolved into a not-terrible place to keep your log and/or stalk Patrick Stroup’s every lift/meal/BM. We have competitive CrossFitters, Strongmen, PLers, and weightlifters from all around the world keeping their logs and there and posting mirror pics after bench/chins supersets, and not a whole lot of shits are given, nor jimmies russled. Enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Matt F asks, “How do you treat conditioning for lifters or people generally more interested in lifting?”</strong></p>
<p>Minimal. Depending on the case, I would stick to 2-3 days a week at most, with no more than one session in excess of 5-6 minutes and no more than 10 (and that’s if you are in more of a GPP phase, far out from competition). I typically like to make up circuits out of assistance work the lifter would do anyway, such as back extensions, weighted sit-ups, pullups, dips, rope climbs, etc. Kettlebell and dumbbell work is a good option as well, and occasionally I like the Prowler, but be careful – it can leave you wrecked for the next day’s training. Same goes for strongman type stuff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rick R asks, “Why would someone be able to do a hang power clean with a given weight, but struggle to do a power clean from the floor with the same weight?”</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To put it simply: the closer the bar gets to the floor, the more complex the pull becomes. In the hang position, the lifter does not have to worry about what is perhaps the most complex part of the lift – the gradual, controlled backwards movement of the knees as the bar passes them. With the hang variation, even an inexperienced lifter can fairly easily keep the bar close and moving towards their center of mass, stay on their heels, and finish aggressively at the top with the bar where it’s supposed to be.</p>

<p><strong>Kenneth M asks, “What are some good drills for improving speed under the bar?”</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snatches/cleans from the hip and high hang. Snatches/cleans from the high blocks. No hook grip/no foot movement snatches (you can do cleans with this exercise too but I don’t think it’s nearly as effective). Anything that a) minimizes time between the initiation of the pull and the finish and b) teaches you to move smoothly and immediately under the bar.</p>

<p>I’d like to take this opportunity to address what I feel is a common mistake: the snatch balance, which is a very useful exercise for other things, will NOT make you faster under the bar in the snatch! It may increase your comfort in going under the bar, and it may help make you stronger in the jerk, but going under a bar which is moving from your back to overhead is in no way the same as going under a bar which is going from the floor to overhead.  If you want to get faster in the snatch, you have to snatch.</p>
<p><strong>Brendan W asks, “What are your go-to assistance exercises for increasing shoulder stability?”</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Push press, rows, pullups, band facepulls and pull-aparts, planks, Sotts press, snatches and clean &amp; jerks.</p>

  <p><em>During the Arnold Sports Festival Mike Jenkins was kind enough to let me interview him in the Rogue booth. Unfortunately, the two minute interview we did had too much background noise. When I told him about it on Twitter, he told me to call him and do a phone interview. Yesterday we had a 20 minute conversation discussing his career. Unfortunately (again) the app I used on my phone to record the conversation only recorded me talking. EPIC FAIL. Clearly I do not have future in journalism. Thankfully, I have a decent memory, and wrote down most of the things we talked about. -Mike B.</em></p>
<p>In case you have been living under a rock, Mike Jenkins is an American Strongman Corporation professional strongman sponsored by <a href="http://www.roguefitness.com/weightlifting-bars-plates/bars.php?gclid=CN-I0MGN87UCFVGnPAod9A0AWQ" title="Rogue">Rogue</a> and Maximum Human Performance (<a href="http://mhpstrong.com/" title="MHP">MHP</a>). In case of you have never tried MHP’s Dark Matter, do yourself a favor; it’s pretty awesome (MHP has the best supplement names ever).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://mhpstrong.com/2012/10/Jenkins.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="602" /></p>
<p>For those of you that don’t know, even as a sponsored professional strongman, it is difficult to make ends meet just doing strongman. Although Mike has won the Arnold Strongman Classic with a $50,000 prize, not every contest has a purse that high. For his day job, Mike is a recreation leader at Milton Hershey School in Hershey, Pennsylvania. This is not a typical school however. <a href="http://www.mhs-pa.org/">Milton Hershey School</a> is a private school that focuses on the individual growth of the student more so than a traditional school. The students at the school have different social and financial needs than traditional schools, and talking to Mike about it, he clearly has a passion for his work. The kids also love the fact that Mike competes in strongman, and love watching him compete.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mike works with a few younger, local football players, because he feels that some of the football strength programs are a bit out of touch with the times. He also emphasized that not all of these coaches are enthused about the help he gives these players, which to me is just crazy. Just looking at Mike and what he has accomplished, why wouldn’t you want him to help your players get stronger?</p>
<p>Prior to picking up strongman in 2007, Mike played 12 years of high school, collegiate, and professional football. When I asked why he stopped playing, he gave the answer I have heard many times, and it was that he lost love for the game. Thankfully for us, in 2007 Mike picked up a pair of farmer’s walk implements that his friend had, and entered his first contest shortly thereafter. Also in 2007, he went to North American Strongman Nationals and placed sixth. In 2009, Mike would place second in that same contest. In 2010 however, is where Mike truly took the strongman world by storm.</p>
<p>The Arnold Amateur Strongman World Championships were first held in 2010, and the winner received a pro card. In 2010 that winner was none other than Mike Jenkins. Not only did he receive a pro card, he was invited back in 2011 to compete with the big boys (literally) at the Arnold Strongman Classic (ASC). While the World’s Strongest Man (WSM) title might be the title that the average person has heard of, strongman enthusiasts know that the Arnold Strongman Classic is the heaviest contest, and carries prestige nearly equal to WSM. Mike pointed out that because the ASC is such a heavy event, there are rarely repeat winners (aside from six time champ Zydrunas Savickas). In 2011 Mike made his professional debut at the ASC, and finished in second place behind Brian Shaw. More impressive than that however, was that he came out ahead of Big Z, who placed a disappointing third. How many people can say in their debut pro strongman contest they upset Big Z?</p>
<p>In 2012 Mike would go on to win the ASC ahead of fellow American Derek Poundstone, and 2011 winner Brian Shaw (who suffered a torn biceps). I was fortunate enough to be sitting in the center row of that contest as I watched this:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EgcZjMxves?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>After other athletes failed to press the log, Mike comes out and presses it TWICE. And this log weighs 460 pounds. It was quite a sight to see, especially since Big Z, arguably the greatest strongman ever, only pressed it once.</p>
<p>In addition to a 2nd place finish at the ASC 2011, and a 1st place finish in the ASC 2012, Mike has also competed in two WSM finals. In the 2011 WSM Mike finished in 8th, and in 2012 he finished in 5th. When I asked if he thought he could one day be a WSM title holder, the answer was a resounding yes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as we all know, strongman can be hard on the body. Going into WSM 2012 Mike had some pain in his left knee, but didn’t think much of it other than it was a minor issue. Unfortunately, during his narrow miss to match Big Z on the 220k log press he heard a “crunch” in his left knee. After returning home from California, Mike spent a few months trying to rehab it himself, and even received shots that made it feel temporarily better. However, nothing was really working to allow him to train at 100%. In December, Mike made the decision that he needed to have surgery. Mike said that although in the short term he had to withdraw from the ASC 2013, it was his career and even more so, his long term physical abilities that needed to worry about. Since then Mike has made significant progress, and plans to be ready in September for WSM 2013. He has resumed squatting and deadlifting, and is quickly getting back to where he needs to be.</p>
<p>When I talked to Mike about his strengths and weaknesses in the gym, he was quick to identify them. I figured Mike would say his world class pressing ability was his strength, but he said he felt moving events were his best. I can’t really argue with that though, the guy can seriously move with a yoke. As far as weaknesses, Mike says he needs to bring his deadlift up. Moving forward, he is going to be working with Brandon Lilly from <a href="http://www.jtstrong.com/articles/TeamJTS/brandon-lilly">Juggernaut Training Systems</a> or Jesse Burdick from Powerwod.com/Supertraining (<a href="http://powerwod.com">http://powerwod.com</a>/) in his pursuit of a bigger pull. Mike has actually been working with Jesse for the past few months on his diet, and has dropped from 400lbs to about 350lbs. Note: Mike routinely posts pictures of empty Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream containers on Twitter, and keeps losing weight. We need to redefine “superfood”. Something else that was interesting is that this will be the first time Mike has ever worked with a coach for strongman. He has taught himself to be a strongman through trial-and-error. He did however mention this is not an approach that will work for everyone. Mike said that if you have the opportunity to learn from anyone that has competed in strongman, at least listen to what they have to say.</p>
<p>When I asked Mike about his long term future in strongman, he didn’t give me a definitive answer. He knows for now that he wants to get his knee back to 100%, and get back to WSM. We briefly discussed the longevity of athletes in the sport, and he pointed out how heavy the weights have gotten over the years. In January, Mike wrote <a href="http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2013/01/31/record-setting-log-pressing/">this article</a> for JTS strength highlighting how the log press records have been utterly annihilated over the past 15 years. The fact is, the weights keep getting heavier, and this is going to be a factor in how long strongmen are in the game. How many ASC and WSM competitions can a person’s body really handle?</p>
<p>I’m extremely thankful that Mike took time to let me interview him not once, but twice in the past week. Mike has already accomplished quite a bit in his career, and doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. I for one would love to see him press a 500lb log, maybe even before Big Z. Let’s hope he has a fast recovery and once again makes a trip to WSM. Who knows, maybe he could be standing on the podium in six short months…</p>
