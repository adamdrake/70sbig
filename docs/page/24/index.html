  <p>__Did you see the CF Open 13.1 WOD? There were a lot of snatches, to say the least. ___<a title="Jacob's Gym" href="http://crossfitmonterey.com/" target="_blank">Jacob Tsypkin</a> wrote this article not to piss you off (though it might), but to start a discussion about how CrossFit is enabling American Weightlifting to experience a rejuvenation that might just help make us relevant on the international stage again. _</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There has always been some tension between strength sport communities and CrossFit.  Though in recent years, many great strength athletes and coaches have affiliated themselves with CrossFit, it seems that there is also a large contingent of strength athletes who are at best lukewarm towards it, if not outright vitriolic. Much of the dislike seems to come with regard to the Olympic lifts, perhaps due to their technical nature, and their so called “misuse” by CrossFitters.</p>
<p>I am very fortunate. I have been lucky enough to train with some of the best coaches and athletes in both CrossFit and weightlifting. I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of both of these sports. The elitists, the douchebags, and the great people who love their sport and want to make it better. I have competed and coached competitors in both endeavors. As such, I feel I have a unique perspective on the matter.</p>
<p>Of course, I have my own opinions on the arguments presented by weightlifters against CrossFit. However, I do not want to discuss opinions here. I want to present some facts. Some absolute truths, which I ask you to keep in mind when analyzing what CrossFit has done, is doing, or can do for the sport of weightlifting.</p>
<p><strong>Fact 1: CrossFit is creating more interest in weightlifting than there has ever been in the U.S.</strong></p>
<p>5000+ CrossFit gyms worldwide (I don’t know how many exactly are in the U.S., but it is the VAST majority) educating people about the lifts. Some of them may not do a great job of teaching the lifts themselves, but consider this: the odds of an average individual knowing that the snatch and clean &amp; jerk exist, that they are a sport, and understanding how challenging that sport is, are MUCH higher now than they have ever been before.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2013/03/some-truths-about-crossfit-and-weightlifting/chrisw_camille_/" rel="attachment wp-att-8771"><img data-attachment-id="8771" data-permalink="/blog/2013/03/some-truths-about-crossfit-and-weightlifting/chrisw_camille_/" data-orig-file="/2013/03/chrisw_Camille_.jpg" data-orig-size="1600,1067" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="CF Games + Weightlifting " data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2013/03/chrisw_Camille_-200x133.jpg" data-large-file="/2013/03/chrisw_Camille_-450x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8771" src="/2013/03/chrisw_Camille_-200x133.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133" srcset="/2013/03/chrisw_Camille_-200x133.jpg 200w, /2013/03/chrisw_Camille_-150x100.jpg 150w, /2013/03/chrisw_Camille_-450x300.jpg 450w, /2013/03/chrisw_Camille_-449x300.jpg 449w, /2013/03/chrisw_Camille_.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Fact 2: CrossFit is bringing the idea of effective GPP programming to a larger audience than ever in the U.S.</strong></p>
<p>Nations which are highly successful in weightlifting almost universally have effective GPP programs in place which start at a very young age. Most of us can probably agree that physical education in the U.S. is subpar. Kids’ programs in CrossFit gyms across the country are getting young Americans excited about exercise – this alone is a huge step.  Couple that with creating interest in the olympic lifts, and a GPP program which is much more similar to what you would see in countries that win medals in weightlifting – that is to say, they are biased towards teaching movement rather than particular sports. This has the potential to lead to a massive improvement in the general athleticism of the average American, which in turn carries over to more potential in young weightlifters.</p>
<p><strong>Fact 3: CrossFit is gradually generating a nationwide talent identification program.</strong></p>
<p>Something else which weightlifting medal winning nations often hold in common with each other, is a method by which they identify young athletes with potential for particular sports. In the U.S. no such program exists, in large part because we tend to specify athletes at a very young age, rather than presenting them with a broad array of athletic endeavors to learn, enjoy, and potentially excel in. Here’s where CrossFit comes in. Along with “traditional” sports they participate in, kids in these programs are learning the basics of weightlifting, gymnastics, sprinting, jumping, and the like. Merely by virtue of spending time engaging in this wide variety of movements, coaches will be granted the opportunity to identify kids who have potential as weightlifters early in their athletic careers, something which very rarely occurs now.</p>
<p>Whether you are a CrossFitter or a weightlifter, whether you love or hate CrossFit, it’s hard to debate the truth of the above claims. Their value may be questioned, but I, personally, am willing to bet that CrossFit will end up doing far more good for the sport of weightlifting than it does bad.</p>
<p>Besides, CrossFit is leading to this:</p>

<p><em>Sarabeth Phillips is a CrossFit Competitor. CrossFit was her introduction to weightlifting. She now snatches 80 and clean &amp; jerks 95 at a bodyweight of 58.</em></p>
<p>And that, I think we can all agree, is something we need more of.</p>

  <p>It’s PR Friday! Here’s some media from last week’s Arnold NAPF Raw Challenge to get you inspired over the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="/ac/" target="_blank">AC’s log</a> is consistently the most popular on the site. This comes as no surprise once you see his intensity on the platform and his constant interaction with his fans. Check out his write-up on the Arnold (there’s a surprise ending), and this video of his lifts:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rypy9Fbn80o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><a href="/mike/" target="_blank">Mike B</a> also had a good meet at the Arnold and did a write-up on his training log. Check out his video here, and subscribe to his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ghoststoglory/videos" target="_blank">often-updated YouTube channel</a> while you’re at it:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpse1G3PB4U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><a href="/NolanPower" target="_blank">Matt Nolan</a> finished second in his class and damn near pulled 733lbs. What do you think he’ll hit at Nats?</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRTlq01j8gc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><a href="/chris/" target="_blank">Big Chris</a> has been real, real busy since the Arnold, so I haven’t seen any log updates or a video of his lifts…but at least he squats deeply:</p>

<p>Marc wasn’t extremely pleased with his meet, but I was happy to see that he finished strong, <a href="http://mailorderbridefromrussia.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/arnold-stories/" target="_blank">posted some great stories about the Arnold</a>, and perhaps most importantly, got a stellar picture of the crew with the legendary Ed Coan.

<p>Matt Baller hit a new IPF World Record bench…twice. Here’s the bigger of the two:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vZMSCfws69I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Jennifer Thompson blew us all away again with a very impressive meet, including a PR squat and dead, and chipping her own World Record bench to 137kg/302lbs (@ the 2:00 mark in the video). Amazing.</p>

<p>How’d your week go? Tell us about your PRs and put up a video. Just copy/paste the simple youtube address in your comment for it to show up properly formatted. Just so: “http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoTYAlMy57I”  So easy, a meathead could do it.</p>

  <p>_<a title="Jacob's Gym" href="http://crossfitmonterey.com/" target="_blank">Jacob Tsypkin</a> has been fielding questions on our facebook page about weightlifting/crossfit/__training/coffee/beardliness, and will compile 3-4 of them weekly for your reading pleasure. You’re welcome. _</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">Gregor S asks, “Squatting every day: a good idea?”</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Yes.  No.  Maybe.  Sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">View the option of daily squatting as a tool.  I have used it to great effect in certain situations.  It can work to break plateaus, it can work for lifters who are significantly better at volume than they are at intensity, and it can work, surprisingly, for lifters who have knee pain when squatting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The key is doing it intelligently.  You’re working up to a heavyish single each day (occasionally I’ll work in a double or triple instead.)  If you feel great, go for a PR.  If you don’t feel great, just hit what you can hit without getting ugly and call it a day.  If you want daily squatting to be effective, you absolutely MUST check your ego at the door.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">Andrew K asks, “What cues do you like to use for the jerk? How about supplemental exercises?”</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Predictably, the answer is, “it depends.”  It depends on what the lifter is doing right or wrong, what they’re good or bad at, and of course, what they respond to.  With that said, some of the most common cues I use are:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">“</span><span style="color: #000000">Drive it high and back” to get the lifter to be aggressive in driving the bar off the shoulders</span><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><span style="color: #000000">“</span><span style="color: #000000">Move straight” to cue the lifter to keep the hips and torso moving straight down/up/down</span><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><span style="color: #000000">“</span><span style="color: #000000">Step in front of the bar” to get the lifter to reach their front foot out to an adequate degree</span><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><span style="color: #000000">“</span><span style="color: #000000">Keep driving, keep reaching” to cue the lifter to stay with the bar, driving it as high as possible and to be active, rather than passive, about receiving and holding it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">For supplemental exercises, again it depends on what the athlete needs. Obviously the jerk from blocks is fantastic, and I prefer it from behind the neck for most people, as it teaches the lifter where the bar needs to be and, for most people, allows them to handle more weight. Of course, the jerk from the front rack is also very useful, so we employ both.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A fantastic exercise for improving footwork is Glenn Pendlay’s jerk ladder.</span><span style="color: #000000"> This drill will help the lifter get used to the back foot landing first and “catching” himself with the front foot, as well as learning to remain rigid when going under the weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkEUCer1MiI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Lastly, the press from split is something all of my lifters do both when learning the jerk and in their warm-ups. It’s exactly what it sounds like: with the bar in the front rack, walk the feet out into your split position, and press. The most crucial part is that the press is EXTREMELY strict. There must be no movement of the legs, hips, or torso whatsoever. By doing this, the lifter learns where his body needs to be when receiving the jerk.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000"><a title="Stroup's Training Log and place to cuss and yell" href="http://forum.liftheavyshit.com/index.php?topic=100.0" target="_blank">Stroup</a> asks, “What is the minimal amount of weightlifting training a CrossFitter needs?”</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In a word, plenty.  Assuming we are talking about competitive CrossFitters here, my athletes do the snatch and clean &amp; jerk heavy three times a week each, on average.  That’s not including what they do in conditioning circuits. I think this would roughly hold true with most competitive CrossFitters.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Rudy Nielsen of <a href="www.outlawcoach.wordpress.com" target="_blank">The Outlaw Way</a></span><span style="color: #000000"> wrote the following in an article about the importance of weightlifting for CrossFitters:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000">“</span><span style="color: #000000">Larson also has added up the total point values for every movement tested during both the 2011 and 2012 Games seasons. The snatch and clean &amp; jerk are worth 20 percent of the total point value. If you add accessories, you have 36 percent of the total point value—read that again, except in all caps: THIRTY-SIX PERCENT. I can and will talk about exactly how the lifts develop the athlete from an overall perspective, but strictly from a sporting perspective, that’s a lot of points.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Between that, and the ability of the lifts to improve an athlete in so many ways, I think it’s undeniable that if you want to be a good CrossFitter, you’ve got to spend some serious time developing the snatch and clean &amp; jerk.</span></p>

  <p><em>You could file today’s post under “Trying something new”. It comes from my friend Brendan: fed up with the corporate grind, he took a page from Steve Jobs’ book of “Do what you love”, and made a career change. Along the way, he also got into the sport of MMA. Here he details his progression into the sport and some of his training ideas, along with how it helped his gym lifts. – Brian</em></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>A very wise man once stated to me that I “just needed to do it, not to talk about doing it,</p>
<p>but just f***ing do it.”</p>
<p>If that doesn’t speak to you about how to live life then I don’t know what does.</p>
<p>My post meathead/football career exported me to a financial firm where days consisted</p>
<p>of shares settling, leveraging foreign currency, and Far East markets. I gained 40lbs and</p>
<p>hated myself.</p>
<p>One year later I quit, went back into training, and started Office to Octagon Inc. on an</p>
<p>ideal with little to no direction.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF2374pB-u8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within three months I started Olympic lifting as a director at InnerCity Weightlifting</p>
<p>where I was fortunate enough to work with nationally ranked lifters and at risk youth in</p>
<p>Boston.</p>
<p>By chance I was training someone who would later become a mentor figure. He served</p>
<p>as high-level management at a Fortune 100 and to this day eats, breaths, and sleeps</p>
<p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>He introduced me to Kimura BJJ and by my third practice I was addicted and under</p>
<p>the instruction of Michael Fontes placed first or second in my first four competitions.</p>
<p>Everything in my training world was flipped upside down.</p>
<p>The whole concept of my strength training being compromised by overwhelming</p>
<p>amounts of aerobic activity was shattered. If anything, most of my lifts improved. In each</p>
<p>practice live fights take place, mostly towards the end after hundreds of repetitions of</p>
<p>particular techniques and positions. Fights range from 2-10 minutes and are balls to the</p>
<p>wall. The more I fought the stronger I became both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>In my first four months I went from 285 to 240, increased my strength, and grew a sweet</p>
<p>ass mustache. Friends of mine in the strength and conditioning world started to reach out</p>
<p>and ask questions about my training.</p>
<p>These are some of the evolving conclusions that I continue to work on.</p>
<p>Time under tension will increase aerobic and anaerobic capacity. I found this to be true</p>
<p>as a young lad moving furniture and interning/lifting at an athletic facility. After 8 to 12</p>
<p>hours of lugging heavy awkward objects up and down stairs, I would still be able to make</p>
<p>gains in the gym relative to copious amounts of time under tension and food.</p>
<p>So was the case with BJJ. I started to mimic fight rounds in my lifting programs by</p>
<p>picking a series of movements and performing a set number of reps, or over the course of predetermined time (Tabata). It was reminiscent of CrossFit but in a way safer, more</p>
<p>structured, and more specific to my sport. As I am sure the 70’s Big community knows,</p>
<p>specificity is key.</p>
<p>Placing emphasis on grip training in moving, training, and BJJ has and will continue</p>
<p>to pay dividends on all of my lifts and I highly encourage anyone and everyone to</p>
<p>incorporate grip work into all of their programming. If you can’t grip it, you can’t lift it.</p>
<p>Now back to how all of this began. Office to Octagon Inc. started out as my journey into</p>
<p>MMA via strength and conditioning and BJJ. Two years later my first amateur fight is set</p>
<p>for June 22nd.</p>
<p>The kicker is that I am putting the event together through OtoO and 20 other Boston</p>
<p>business types will also be competing, all while raising money for charity in the process.</p>
<p>Office to Octagon Inc. is now a 501(c)3 non-profit organization structured to allocate</p>
<p>funds to underprivileged youth obesity prevention initiatives, youth athletics, and youth</p>
<p>nutritional education services.</p>
<p>The art forms that make up MMA have all stood the test of time i.e. boxing, BJJ, Muay</p>
<p>Thai, wrestling, all the very things that we should be investing in and promoting to our</p>
<p>youth. They all embrace respect, discipline, adversity, and focus, exactly what the kids of</p>
<p>this country so desperately need.</p>
<p>In a time where the generations behind us now have a shorter life expectancy,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.designedtomove.org">www.designedtomove.org</a>, it is our duty to fight these odds literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>If you want to make positive changes and/or be good at anything you “just have to</p>
<p>f***ing do it”.</p>

  <p>Well, the weekend of the Arnold is over. Sadly, I did not attend this year, but I was constantly in contact with various field reporters and friends who were on-site, and I’m already looking forward to Arnold 2014, where I hope to be coaching several lifters. We’ll have a pretty big gathering of 70sBig folks for sure. Did any of you meet up and share mead? Were you able to watch the multitude of our community who competed? Did you get a cool shirt, at least? (Many thanks to my lifter Ben, who brought me one back!)</p>
<p>Last Monday, we <a href="/blog/2013/02/the-arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrnold-is-here/" target="_blank">previewed</a> some of the female weightlifters (along with Jennifer Thompson…who, spoiler alert, broke her own bench world record!). Now, you can check out the results, since you couldn’t watch it live. (Note: I’m still waiting on the ACTUAL results sheet to be posted, but keep clicking the facebook pages below since that’s where I’ll be sourcing them from).</p>
<p>The Columbus Weightlifting Club holds this annual meet, which is no small feat. There are countless hours of work involved in putting on the Arnold Weightlifting Championships, so give them some credit. They have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColumbusWeightlifting" target="_blank">team facebook page</a>, but also an Arnold-specific one <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArnoldWeightliftingChampionships" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Note that they recently asked “Only 361 days until Arnold 2014!! What would you like to see next year?” I suggest letting them know that livestreaming the lifting is something you’d be interested in, if that’s the case. I will be suggesting that, at least.</p>
<p>In any case, they posted most of the videos online relatively quickly. You can search through various parameters and find who you want to see <a title="Tons of videos" href="http://www.dartfish.tv/Presenter.aspx?CR=p90777c60150" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>There are also some great photos from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hookgripdotcom" target="_blank">hookgrip.com</a>. I don’t know these guys, but they have by far the best photos of Olympic Weightlifting you’ll see on the internet. Go to their facebook page and like them. You won’t be sorry.</p>

<p>So, there are the links. Let’s open this up for discussion. How did you feel about not being able to watch the weightlifting on the internet? How do you feel about the coverage this event received? Did you know it was the Pan-Am qualifier? Whose performance was the most impressive to you, and which performances were you disappointed by?</p>

  <p><em>Note: This week’s posting schedule for the site got a little thrown off because I took the opportunity to interview <a href="/blog/2013/02/meet-the-man-who-squats-905-raw/" target="_blank">Ray Williams</a> and decided to post it immediately. It turns out that it was pretty popular. We had almost exactly twice as many hits in a day as the next best post in the history of the site (“<a title="You should probably click this. It's fun. " href="/blog/2012/07/sexy-isnt-always-better/" target="_blank">Sexy Isn’t Always Better</a>” which has, go figure, pics of hot chicks bending over). Gregor, of <a title="This site is awesome. Follow them on facebook. " href="http://www.allthingsgym.com/" target="_blank">All Things Gym</a> fame, shared the post on Reddit, and we had a few dozen forums also link back to the story. In fact, a couple Redditors were so impressed by the story that a new bar and several 100lb plates are on their way to Ray’s gym, so that he can start working that linear progression to like, a million, give or take. <golf clap></em></p>
<p><strong>BUT NOW IT’S TIME TO GET BACK TO THE ARNOLD!</strong></p>
<p>Going forward, Thursdays will be a Q&amp;A with our very own Tsypkin. In fact, he sent me a post for today before he got on a plane for Columbus (not to be confused with Cleveland), OH, because he is a very nice person, and thorough. Instead, I’m going to risk his wrath and wait until next week to post his very excellent advice. Why? <strong>BECAUSE ARNOLD, THAT’S WHY!</strong></p>

  <p>Over the weekend, a video quickly started spreading amongst the powerlifters of the world. Everyone stared in disbelief as they watched…questioning at first, but finally settling into simple awe. This shocking video depicts a man none of us have ever heard of, squatting over 900 pounds with just a singlet and a belt at the Alabama State USAPL Championships. No XXS knee sleeves (certainly no wraps), no special squat-suit – not even special lifting shoes. Just a large man with a <em>LARGE</em> amount of weight on his back, moving it around like he’d done it a hundred times.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgV8qM0vwrI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>This man is Ray Williams. In only his second powerlifting meet, he smashed the American USAPL Squat record with his second attempt, and on his third, easily squatted a weight that would shatter the current IPF world record, were it done in the proper circumstances, with the proper judging, and, of course, assuming he becomes accustomed to waiting for the “rack” command. Did I mention this is his second meet?</p>
<p>I tracked down Ray in Mississippi and spoke with him on the phone about his past, his lifting, and his future goals in the sport. I had no choice but to speak to him as a fan more than as a fellow lifter – he was as respectful, humble, and generous with his time as anyone you’ll ever meet (and likely the only person who addresses me as “sir!”). He was quick to give credit to his family, especially his brother, who got him into the sport and will be competing alongside him at 2013 USAPL Raw Nationals in Orlando. Last year, the Super-Heavy showdown between Brad Gillingham and Randall Harris was epic, to say the least. I can’t wait to see what goes down this year.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone is saying “Who is this guy?! Where did he come from?” Tell us a little about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Ray Williams, and I’m from the small town of Demopolis, Alabama. I’m about 6 feet, 361 pounds – that’s what I weighed in at the meet this past weekend. I coach Junior College Football. I’ll be married 2 years in November, and have 2 beautiful kids. My wife and my kids – they’re my motivation for powerlifting. One of the biggest reasons I think I was able to get 900lbs this past weekend was because in 2011, my daughter died. She was born, survived 11 days, and passed away due to being born premature. That, over everything else, is my motivation – her.</p>
<p><strong>You have a pretty extensive football background as a player, and now you’re a coach. How important has football been to your life?</strong></p>
<p>Football kept me out of trouble growing up. Seventh and Eighth grades were the toughest two years of my life. I had more discipline referrals than I had positive comments. In High School, everybody was like “come out and play football!” It was naturally easy – people pat you on the back for going and knocking the mess outta somebody! I signed at UT-Martin, made All- American my Senior year, All-Conference my Junior and Senior years. If I could do it again, I would. I was able to try out for 2 NFL teams, but it didn’t work out for me. I could have played Canadian ball, but it was just too far from my family.</p>
<p><strong>So did you get your introduction to lifting from football? How long have you been lifting in general?</strong></p>
<p>I started really, really getting into weights my 10th grade year. I said “If I want to be good at football, I might want to be good at this, too.” My Senior year, me and my brother William were first and second for every record in the high school. I squatted about 545, benched 440, and hang-cleaned around 315 or 335. I didn’t deadlift until after I was done playing ball.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been powerlifting specifically?</strong></p>
<p>This was my second meet. My brother got into it first, and one day he talked me into it and I just ran with it.</p>
<p><strong>What are your current meet and gym PRs for the big 3 lifts?</strong></p>
<p>I squatted 860 and 905 (the 905 didn’t count due to a step forward before the call), benched 475, and pulled 700. I’ve benched more in the gym, but everything else was a personal record.</p>
<p><strong>Do you follow a specific training schedule or program?</strong></p>
<p>I try to focus on the core lifts, not so much on the auxiliaries. My week looks like this:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Monday</span> – Deadlift, all sumo from the floor.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tuesday</span> – Squat, usually it looks something like this:</p>
<p>315×5</p>
<p>405×1</p>
<p>500×1</p>
<p>600×1</p>
<p>700 5×5</p>
<p>I want to work up to 5×10 at 700 because the gym I work out in, the bars aren’t long enough for more weight, that’s all I can get on there. Whatever I can get on there, I can’t let myself get comfortable with it, so I’m trying to add reps every week since I can’t add weight.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Wednesday</span> – Bench Press:</p>
<p>Right now I don’t bench enough for my bodyweight, so I have to get to where I can rep 450 comfortably for 5 reps for multiple sets. I do multiple sets of 5 until I’m comfortable with a weight. I strained something in my arm and right shoulder and if I get out too wide, it hurts, so I try to keep my grip narrow.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Thursday</span> – Rest</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Friday</span> – This is for all my auxilary work that make me better on my core lifts. My favorites? Curls and Tris! I’ve done biceps and tris every day for the last few weeks. I have to get my arms up.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Saturday</span> – I just go in and loosen up and do a little cardio.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sunday</span> – Rest</p>
<p><strong>Where do you workout? Do you train alone, or with a partner/group?</strong></p>
<p>We have a huge gym in Fulton, MS, the Davis Event Center, probably one of the best Junior College Basketball Gyms around. Attached to that is a very nice weight room and I work out there. I have a partner, a student assistant that is trying to get back into powerlifting form, and I’m trying to get stronger, so we push each other.</p>
<p><strong>Do you mainly train the big lifts, or do you perform variations of them as mainstays in your training?</strong></p>
<p>I mostly focus on the big lifts and auxiliary work (bis and tris).</p>
<p><strong>What do you think has contributed the most to your phenomenal strength levels?</strong></p>
<p>I hate failure. I hate to fail. When you’re up on that platform, and everyone’s looking at you – I have my wife, my friends, my family looking at me – I don’t want to fail in front of these people. Kind of like when you’re working out, you put 700lbs on the bar, you can almost bet the entire gym is <em>only</em> watching you. If you get back there and you can’t move the weight, you just failed, in front of everyone. I hate failure. I hate to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us more about the “<a href="http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2013/02/cornbread-and-buttermilk_power.html" target="_blank">Cornbread and Buttermilk</a>” story in the local newspaper. What’s your diet like?</strong></p>
<p>If you google ways to get stronger, everybody in the world has their own program, “This is how I got stronger.” But somewhere in there it says “you gotta eat!” My wife’s done an awesome job feeding me, and my mother did an awesome job feeding me when I was young. I’ve always been a big dude, and one thing my grandma brought us up on was cornbread, collard greens, good down-home southern food – it’s always been a staple of my diet. I try to eat good – I’m 361 pounds, but I don’t want to look 361. I try to stay away from fried foods and greasy stuff as much as possible, but my #1 Kryptonite right now is Mountain Dew – I love it.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, where do you think this is going? This being your second meet, the sky’s the limit. What are your goals for powerlifting, and your squat in particular?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to sound bold… Right now I realize I’m blessed, but that I still need to get stronger. But right now my goal is to just get back to the lab and get better. To answer your question – everyone’s joking about calling me “little Mark Henry.” That guy was really, really good – he squatted something like 933 in high school. But I want to be just as good as him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Impressed yet? I am. My favorite part of the conversation was a little more informal, but in regards to the 905 squat he took in the video at the top of this post:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ray:</strong> I was wanting to hit a thousand, but they didn’t have enough 100lb plates.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What?? Would you have called it, if they had it?</p>
<p><strong>Ray</strong>: Oh yeah! I would have tried it. That’s my goal at Nationals. I want to do 1000 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, a legend in the making: Ray Williams.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

  <p>It’s finally here – this is the week of the <a href="http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/" target="_blank">Arnold Sports Festival</a>, which runs this Thursday to Sunday in Columbus, Ohio, and is so massively awesome, it might make you shit your pants. You’ve been warned. If you do, just own it.</p>
<p>This is a huge deal. We have a bunch of 70sBig lifters competing, a lot of readers attending, and there will be more sports and competitions and displays than we could possibly begin to preview, or cover. Luckily, I’m guessing not many of you care as much about the “5k Pump ‘N Run” or the World Jump Rope Championships, and we’ll be sticking to covering mostly the lifting exploits, and probably a few pictures of the IFBB stuff just for funsies.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Ladies’ Mondays, I thought I’d highlight two female weightlifters who will be competing on Saturday, and whose coaches actually post on here.</p>
<p>Glenn Pendlay is a household name in our world (unless you’re ow3n), and his MuscleDriver USA team will be very well-represented at the Arnold, which also serves as the qualifier for the Pan-Ams. I think he’s coaching around 9 athletes, which sounds pretty much like cardio. We’ll cover some of the guys later in the week, but you already know Jon North is one of ’em. Did you realize, however, that Jon’s wife is also competing? Jessica is a ton of fun to watch in the MDUSA training streams, because her quiet intensity and determination is inspiring as hell. Check out this video, ignore the cheesy music (really, Jon, really?), and tune in Saturday to see how she does in the 75kg class.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rWyLU-AHfP0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><a href="http://alongthelinesof.com/">Big Ben “Brown Thunder” Claridad</a> has also been a friend of the site for a long time, and was teaching us all how important it was to have ginormous arms before we even knew who CT Fletcher was. He’s not only competing (105+), but also coaching two female lifters, Emelie (75+) and Cecily (69). I haven’t met Emelie, but I can attest to the fact that Cecily is just as fun and inspiring to watch as Jess North. When I briefly met her and Ben at Cal-Strength, I got to witness one of the most badass jerk recoveries of all time. Little did I know she would make a habit of it.</p>

    Amanda and Jess at Raw Nats
  </p>
</div>
<p>In Powerlifting, I could go on and on about at least half of the female competitors. There are several who have posted on here in the past, and several who I’ve met in person and are flat out awesome. Amanda Padgett’s long humble discussion with my special lady friend at Raw Nats is something Jess still smiles about to this day. She also loves to tell the story about her competitor, the one-and-only Jennifer Thompson, taking time to cheer her on mid-meet. JT is one of the best powerlifters of all time, male or female, and at last year’s Arnold, <a href="/blog/2012/03/jennifer-thompson/" target="_blank">she broke the 300lb bench barrier</a> – raw and drug tested – at 132 pounds. I think she’s going to break that this year… Check out this vid she put out in the past week of her smoking a 305lb training lift.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImaqSv_lCow?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>We’ll continue coverage this week of more lifters, more sports, more hookers, and more blow. If you’re attending the Arnold and would like to submit some photos, I’d appreciate it – click on <a href="/submissions/" target="_blank">Submissions</a> and get’r’dun.</p>

  <p>It’s PR Friday! The new phone book’s here!</p>
<p>We started off the week strong, <a title="Click here to reveal Ninja secrets!" href="/blog/2013/02/ryan-carrillo-is-70sbig/" target="_blank">with a write-up on Ryan Carrillo</a>, his quest to compete at the IPF Bench Press World Championships, and a quick interview <a href="/blog/2013/02/pr-friday-22-feb-2013/ryanrib/" rel="attachment wp-att-8594"><img data-attachment-id="8594" data-permalink="/blog/2013/02/pr-friday-22-feb-2013/ryanrib/" data-orig-file="/2013/02/ryanrib.jpg" data-orig-size="720,960" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ryan rib" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2013/02/ryanrib-150x200.jpg" data-large-file="/2013/02/ryanrib-450x600.jpg" class="alignright  wp-image-8594" src="/2013/02/ryanrib-450x600.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="324" srcset="/2013/02/ryanrib-450x600.jpg 450w, /2013/02/ryanrib-112x150.jpg 112w, /2013/02/ryanrib-150x200.jpg 150w, /2013/02/ryanrib-225x300.jpg 225w, /2013/02/ryanrib.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /></a>.</p>
<p>For those that have donated, may Crom grant you many bench PRs. You are good people. Ryan is sincerely thankful to everyone who donated. He got about 150 doll hairs from our readers on Monday, but I think we can improve on that. Go to <a href="http://www.txstrongman.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.txstrongman.com/">http://www.txstrongman.com/</a></a> and donate your face off. For best results, do it about 30 minutes before your scheduled intensity day training.</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of Ryan eating a Brontosaurus rib. Yes, this is how we do it in Texas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Justin dropped us a <a href="/blog/2013/02/a-quick-note/" target="_blank">quick note</a> on Tuesday to let us know he’s still around, just busy stacking paper. Lots of good, positive comments by all, which he appreciated. I’ll be taking over the Editor duties, though I’m not as funny or ripped as Justin, just more ridiculously-good-looking, and I like run-on sentences. Any non-grammar feedback is appreciated, so you can always hit me up via <a href="mailto:cloud@70sbig.com?subject=heyyyyyyy" target="_blank">email</a>, mmmk? I’ll respond when I’m not doing curls. Many thanks to BSmith for helping me out with all the behind-the-scenes work…and for making this killer .gif.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/b0swr6V.gif" alt="CT Fletcher Curling" align="middle" /></p>
<p>We also had a follow-up by Tsypkin on <a href="/blog/2013/02/posterior-round-up-part-2" target="_blank">posterior training</a>, specifically for weightlifters, complete with how-to videos featuring his lovely assistant. Some guy named Pendlay commented a couple times. How many other sites have world-class coaches giving you free advice in the comments? That’s a rhetorical question; I don’t read other sites. We did get the comment of the week, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who the hell is this GlenPendlay guy and where did he come from? Can’t believe someone here named themselves after a kind of row… – ow3n</p>

<p>Most importantly, we are <strong>ONE WEEK FROM THE ARNOLD</strong>. This is the biggest sports festival in the entire freaking universe, and a bunch of our folks are competing, so pay attention. We’ll get you previews and links to streams and whatnot next week.</p>
<p>Mike’s training has gone well and he’s looking to hit some big numbers. Subscribe to his Youtube channel, read his <a href="/mike/" target="_blank">training log</a>, and watch this video about what he does in the final week before a big meet.</p>

<p><a href="/chris/" target="_blank">Big Chris</a> will be defending his North American Championship from last year’s Arnold. How does he prepare? He drinks chicken. He. Drinks. Chicken. If you don’t pull 700+ double-overhand, and/or can’t spell “K-A-L-E,” watch this video, and get to work. cya</p>

<p>List your PRs and which event you’re most excited to watch at the Arnold. Personally, I hit some modest bench PRs and got a brutal PSOA-release massage (<a href="/blog/2012/08/finding-the-psoas/">DIY Guide</a> for you sickos), and I have to give a shout-out to my special lady friend, who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0GXFTP0jrw" target="_blank">pulled 280</a>. I’ll be watching the Arnold streams while at a Bachelor party next weekend. Whatcha got?</p>
