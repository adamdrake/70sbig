  <p>_As promised, here’s the second article by Jacob Tsypkin about building up your backside. This one is specifically targeted towards weightlifters, but every general trainee can learn a lot about a coach’s approach to attacking weaknesses by really analyzing these lifts. _</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><a title="Posterior Round-Up: Part 1" href="/blog/2013/02/posterior-round-up-part-1/" target="_blank">Last week</a>, we discussed various general posterior chain strengthening movements which, while useful for improving the snatch and clean &amp; jerk, are not specifically designed to improve those lifts.</span><span style="color: #000000">Today, I want to give you some drills and variations which are particular to creating positional strength for weightlifting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><strong><span style="color: #000000">1. Paused Snatches/Cleans</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I typically employ a 2 count pause just below the knees. This is the mechanically weakest position in the pull and this helps develop the ability to stay over the bar. For newer lifters, the pause also presents them with a chance to correct their positioning during the pull. Singles and doubles are best here.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">2. Two Stop Pulls</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I’m not a big fan of plain old pulls. I think pulls are better employed when you do something to alter them from the actual lift. This is one of my favorite variations: stand on a board, 1-3”. Assume your start position, and SQUEEZE the bar off the floor, so that you are in your “normal” starting position with the bar floating in mid air. Pause for a 2 count, then proceed with the pull until the bar is just below the knees. Pause for a 2 count, and then finish the pull. We usually do 3-5 triples here, with around 100-105% of the best lift, but some heavier singles or doubles wouldn’t kill you.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yqHxroDtwAY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">3. Snatch/Clean Deadlifts</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">You should strive to pull these with exactly the same line that you pull your snatch or clean. If you can’t do it, it’s too heavy. Doing these without straps is great to build up some grip strength and confidence off the floor. A rep scheme I’ve been using, which I got from Coach Don McCauley:</span><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><span style="color: #000000">90%x5x2</span><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><span style="color: #000000">100%x3x2</span><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><span style="color: #000000">110%x2x2</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Percentage of your best snatch/C&amp;J. Do them touch-and-go (not BOUNCING, just TOUCHING,) and after two workouts, up the weights about 2.5kg.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMOF792dE0k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><strong><span style="color: #000000">4. Snatch/Clean RDLs</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Instead of standing straight up at the top, start at your first position (bar in crease of hips for snatch or mid thigh for clean, weight in heels, shoulders slightly behind bar and knees slightly in front of bar.) From there, lower the bar to your second position (bar just below knees, weight in heels, shins vertical, shoulders well in front of bar) and come back up TO YOUR FIRST POSITION, and then aggressively finish the hips as you would in a pull. 3 sets of 5 is good here, typically I will start a cycle at about 85-90% of the best snatch or C&amp;J and work up over the course of 4-6 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/D49ZmeSeEPM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><br /> </span><strong><span style="color: #000000">5. Eccentric Pulls</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Do a snatch/clean pull. Lower the bar over a 10 count, back to your starting position. Focus on maintaining tension and hitting proper positions all the way down. A word of caution: it is best to do a few weeks of isometric paused work (such as the aforementioned paused snatches/cleans or 2 stop pulls) before jumping into these. Start with around 100% of the best snatch or C&amp;J, and three singles of 10 seconds each should be plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8PQvz3RLPM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>

  <p>Dear 70’s Big Readers,</p>
<p>I have accepted a position that will limit my ability to write for 70’s Big for a few months. In order to be successful I will not have time to reply to messages on the website, social media, or e-mail. Fortunately, Jacob Cloud will continue to help in his new role as Editor and will make sure you are supplied with quality, entertaining content. I’ll be around — helping Jacob — but I won’t be interacting as much.</p>
<p>Even though this website is a part of my personality and life, throughout the years I’ve made it a point to hold onto some element of privacy. Thank you for not violating my privacy by repeatedly asking about it.</p>
<p>Enjoy the site, get edu-muh-cated, have a good time, train hard, and eat well.</p>
<p>–Justin</p>

  <p>I first joined this site as an enthusiastic reader, eventually started contributing as an occasional meet-reporter or recipe-guy, and now I serve as ze Editor. In my time with this site, I’ve been consistently in awe of what I’ve watched our community grow into. We come from all sorts of backgrounds – guys and gals, civilians and special forces, Weightlifters, CrossFitters, and Powerlifters. We have competitive lifters among our ranks, and people who are nervously adding 2.5 pounds to their linear progression workouts. One thing unites us, though, and that is the fact that we are part of a supportive community of badasses.</p>
<p>From time to time the site calls our arms to support a cause, like during Movember, and you guys always respond. That’s what I’ll be doing today. I met with one of our own, Ryan Carrillo, this weekend, and I’m not sure I’ve ever been as impressed by a 21 year old kid. He’s trying to reach his first World Event in May, the IPF Bench Press World Championships in Lithuania. <a title="Click Here to Donate" href="http://www.txstrongman.com/" target="_blank">I think we can help get him there.</a></p>

<p>I first officially met Ryan at 2012 USAPL Raw Nats, when the 6’5″ beast came up, politely introduced himself, and asked me about my beard. When a giant of a man compliments your beard, that is a very special thing. He asked if he could take this picture of me as part of a photography project he was working on (he really captured my…oldness, didn’t he?) He’s also supplied gritty facebook profile pics for some of our other lifters, like <a title="Mike's Log" href="/mike/" target="_blank">Mike Battaglino</a>, and is working on even more videos and pictures of the sport he loves.</p>

    Ryan&#8217;s Self-Portrait
  </p>
</div>
<p>I’ve seen Ryan at almost every local meet around central Texas, either competing, coaching, or just supporting his team. You really can’t miss the guy. He’s bigger than Brad Gillingham, and nicer than Jenn Thompson. He consorts with other young world class lifters like Ian Bell and Preston Turner, and cheers on everyone. His coach is the legendary Gene Bell. He’s a full-time student, works a few jobs, is big into photography as a hobby/passion, and still makes time to become a world-class Powerlifter.</p>
<p>He has suffered through serious back injuries and is currently an equipped bench specialist in the USAPL, though his long-term goal is to return to full meets. For now, he has the chance to represent our country in Lithuania this May at the World Championships.</p>
<p>Ryan drove up to my neck of the woods last Friday and we shared a few beers and a lot of good stories. He is absolutely one of the most impressive, respectful, and polite guys you can imagine. At 33, I’m constantly made aware of how young most of the 70sBig crew is, yet I would have never guessed Ryan was 21 by how he handled himself. The two of us collected more than our fair share of slack-jawed stares at the Biergarten, and he handled it like a seasoned vet. I guess walking around every day of your life looking like a pro wrestler tends to create that kind of understated confidence. Having the words “SHUT UP AND SQUAT” on the back of his shirt was a nice touch, too.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSrpzYihUOE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please check out Ryan’s site at <a title="Donate to Ryan here" href="http://www.txstrongman.com/" target="_blank">txstrongman.com</a> and send him a few doll hairs. Every bit helps, and I trust that Ryan will proudly represent us well not only at this year’s World Championships, but for many more to come.</p>
<p>This is what our community is. We don’t just praise the camaraderie, facial hair, attitude, and general awesomeness of the lifters of the 70s – we strive to create a new generation of strength. How do we do this? We open doors. We slam bars after PRs. We grow facial hair and don’t apologize for wearing tanks and short shorts when the sun’s out. We encourage new lifters to get stronger, healthier, and to have more fun. Most importantly, we support our own.</p>

  <p>How was your Valentine’s Day? Did you eat several pounds of medium-rare steak? If not, get off the computer and fire up the grill. If so, please continue. I had a T-Bone and a Strip, and they were both bloody and delicious, thanks for asking.</p>
<p>Monday was the conclusion of Bert and Marijke’s story about her introduction to lifting and her first powerlifting meet. Here’s <a href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-one/" title="Bert’s Lady Friend – Part One">Part 1</a>, and here’s <a href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-two/" title="Bert’s Lady Friend – Part Two">Part 2</a>. I hope you gals send me more articles about your experiences. The whole community is behind you.</p>
<p>Speaking of behinds, everyone’s second-favorite Jacob wrote up a <a href="/blog/2013/02/posterior-round-up-part-1/" title="Posterior Round-Up: Part 1">great little article</a> about posterior training, with the follow-up coming next week. Hopefully you read it thoroughly, or at least scrolled past the picture of Ariel’s back and saw some of the other stuff. I dunno, I didn’t look. I do know that our own Glenn Pendlay made a couple appearances, and hey, he’s a pretty cool guy, right?</p>

<p>Had a couple people submit questions:</p>
<p><strong><em>Karen asks:  I am a female crossfitter (2/yrs) who is not getting enough lifting in the classes and finding them quite unsatisfying for a few different reasons. I am not dumb enough to think I can oly lift on my own but am considering taking the bench press to the globo gym (gym options are limited in my small town). So question for all:  Are you all annoyed when/if a stranger asks for a spot?  Any tips?</em></strong></p>
<p>Karen, three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Talk to your coach first. Tell them you want to get stronger. Always give your coach a heads-up when you’re not happy, and allow them the chance to fix the situation. If he/she doesn’t pay you attention, or refuses to allow you to bench for some asinine reason, send them to me and then go ahead and send your ass to another gym.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a globo, good spots are rare. Know that ahead of time. But you can try. Find someone that looks remotely like they know what they’re doing, and just ask if they mind spotting you. Hint: No bro minds giving a lady a spot. But it’s up to you to define your expectations. A sample conversation would go something like this: “Hi, random fella. I’m going to ask you for a spot not because your neon green shirt and shoes match, but because you’re one of the few people in here that squats, presses, and deadlifts and/or has a sweet beard. Can I get a spot on bench? I’m going for 5 reps. I’d like a little help on the liftoff (on the count of 3) and will ask you to take it IF AND ONLY IF I FAIL THE REP (emphasize this part, make eye contact, and realize that they’ll STILL screw it up half the time). Please don’t touch it unless I mention it. If I ask, grab the bar and rack it. I do not want a bro-spot.” Wink if you’re down with that, or if the beard is that legit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always put three things in a list. And never say “Oly lifting” near Pendlay in person. Trust me.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
  <strong><em>JayGreenShirt asks:  I have been wondering how to program in order to maintain strength on certain lifts. I&#8217;ll give you my own example as a basis for this question. I will likely (hopefully) pull 500 within the next month. I do not care to take my deadlift higher than that at this time and would like to shift my focus to bringing up other lifts. That said, I want to be able to maintain the 500 lbs. deadlifting strength. I would like to know your thoughts on what I would do with my deadlift given this situation.</em></strong>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  Congrats on getting close to the ol&#8217; 500 mark. I&#8217;m not sure why you&#8217;re not re-gearing and getting ready for 600, but to each their own. I think that in order to maintain strength in a movement, you need to maintain your relevant musculature, and maintain your efficiency at the movement (i.e., practice). The deadlift, of all the lifts, is the easiest in these regards. Once you have your form down, you really only need to pull about every 7-10 days to improve strength, and every 10-14 days should be OK for maintaining it (I am speaking in terms of novice to intermediate pullers, obviously). So pull at <em>least</em> 2-3 times a month, do a max effort set, and push those pulls hard. Something in the range of 405&#215;10, 425&#215;7, 455&#215;4-5, etc. outta do it. You could use the 5/3/1 percentages, or just wait for my ebook to come out on the KISS deadlift program. Whatever you decide, don&#8217;t completely neglect your pulls just for the sake of pushing your other lifts, and you&#8217;ll be fine.

  I got my dirty paws on a copy of this rare and expensive book (published in 1978, when, oh, dudes were <a title="This is who we are. We are who this is. " href="/about/" target="_blank"><strong>70sBig</strong></a>), and chances are, you can&#8217;t. So I&#8217;ll share with you some really great stories from it and some of the history, including awesome stuff from the Texas Athletic Club (predecessor to where I train and coach, <a href="/blog/2012/11/hyde-park-gym-ladies-at-the-longhorn-open/">Hyde Park Gym</a> in Austin). By the time we are done, I fully expect all of you to be pressuring Terry Todd to re-publish it.
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
  Luckily, if you&#8217;re on the hunt for ol&#8217; Dr. Terry, he&#8217;s going to be at the Arnold, along with a large portion of the 70sbig crew. I don&#8217;t personally know the man, but I do know he&#8217;s in charge of the Arnold Strongman event, which is just one of the hundreds of things you can see at the Arnold. In the next couple weeks, we&#8217;re really going to dive into a preview, some coverage, and then some recaps of one of the coolest sports festivals in the world.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
  Finally, I&#8217;ll be interviewing Ryan Carillo this weekend. He&#8217;s a 21 year-old powerlifter and already practically the definition of 70sBig at 6&#8217;5&#8243; and 300lbs. <a title="Click here and give this fella your lunch money. Or else. " href="http://www.txstrongman.com/#!untitled/mainPage" target="_blank">Ryan is raising money to go to IPF Bench Press Worlds in Lithuania</a>, and I think we&#8217;re going to be able to help him out a bit. If we&#8217;re lucky, he&#8217;ll give us some tips on increasing our bench, too. Or at least, not eat us.

  <p>_Remember that time you said “Man, I wish my back was weaker?” Yeah, I didn’t think so. This is the first of a two-part series by Jacob Tsypkin on effective movements for training the posterior chain. Tsypkin coaches competitive weightlifters, _CrossFitters,_and even a powerlifter or three (if you force him) so his advice works well for most of you. As with most things in the gym, there’s a right way and a wrong way to do these, so read this carefully, watch the videos, and get to work. _</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000">To anyone remotely familiar with strength training, it is quite obvious that the posterior chain plays an important role in the sport of weightlifting. However, developing strength in the hamstrings, glutes, and back for improving performance in the snatch and clean &amp; jerk isn’t quite as simple as it may seem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I break the movements I use for this purpose down into two groups. This article discusses the first of those groups, the general: These movements are designed to create strength throughout the posterior chain in a way which is not specific to the snatch and clean &amp; jerk. You are probably at least familiar with most of these movements.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">1. Romanian Deadlift</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If you are a consistent reader of 70’s Big, it is pretty unlikely that you haven’t heard plenty about the RDL. I’ll keep it simple here: we train it once a week, usually for 3×5, occasionally building up to a top set of 5 with good form before resetting.  For mechanics, I’ll refer to you Justin’s<a title="RDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDLRDL" href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/"> post on the topic</a>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">2. Pendlay Row</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Basically a strict barbell row. The man himself tells you how to do it in the video below.</span><span style="color: #000000"> We usually do these for heavy sets of 3-5 across, occasionally doubles or singles. In a lighter training phase, or for a lifter who needs some hypertrophy, we’ll do sets up to 10-12 reps.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlRrIsoDpKg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">3. Glute Ham Raise</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I like sets of 5-10 on these. If 10 reps is easy, add some weight. Use with great care; these will make you sore for days. Once a week is plenty, and start with a low dose, like 3×5 (if you can do them at all…a lot of very strong people can’t.)</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9zKJw1KmbA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><em>(I had Tsypkin create a GHR video because 90% of the GHR’s I see out there in the cold dark world are turrible. Just turrible. He got Ariel to be his lovely assistant. You’re welcome. – Cloud)</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">4. Back Extension</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This is a true back extension, as taught here by some strange non-bearded Pendlay impersonator.</span><span style="color: #000000"> Typically I start a lifter with 3×10-15 at bodyweight, and increase the reps up to 20 over a week or two, then add load at 3×10.</span></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdmI5Ex8HMw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">5. Back Raise</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This is what most people refer to as a back extension. In reality the hips and hamstrings are doing the work here, but it’s still a very useful exercise. I follow the same protocol for applying these to a lifter’s training as I do for the back extensions, and Glenn covers this in the back extension video. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the next segment, we will discuss posterior chain exercises specific to the sport of weightlifting.</span></p>

  <p><em>Last Monday, I posted an article by a long-time reader, Bert, about how he introduced his lady friend, Marijke, to lifting, and what a dramatic difference it quickly made in her life. It had a great response amongst dudes and dudettes, and I promised a follow-up article on her first meet, which happened just 4 months after she started lifting. Here it is. A huge thanks to Bert for this well-written submission, and extreme props to Marijke for getting out there and competing after her first four months in the gym. How long have you been lifting? Have you competed? Have you trained a significant other?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In my previous article, I outlined the training and diet I had my girlfriend use during her first four months of powerlifting to have her recover from intestinal and spinal problems. </span>In this article, I’ll review her experiences and results from her first contest.</p>

<p>She went 7/9, doing 70 kg (PR) in the squat (154lbs), 35kg in the bench press (77lbs) and 70 kg (PR) in the deadlift (154lbs). Her second squat attempt was not approved because she racked the bar before the command, and she missed her last bench press attempt of 42.5kg (91lbs) because she gripped the bar closer than normal. Her bodyweight was 54.4 kg (120lbs) in the 56kg weight class, senior category (+24).</p>

<p>Other impressive performances were a 105 lifter of our club who hit 300 – 195 – 300 (geared) and a 125+ lifter who squatted 360kg (geared) and deadlifted 330kg (raw).</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Experiences at the Meet</strong><br /> </span><span style="color: #000000"><br /> Going into the meet, she was nervous: “What if I am the only girl?” (she was); “What if I’m the odd duck there?” (she wasn’t; much odder ducks were present),<strong> “What if my butt looks big?” (it does, but that’s a good thing).</strong></span></p>
<p>All these worries proved to be unfounded. All lifters were extremely supportive and friendly towards her and myself, and encouraged her each time she stepped up to the platform. Seeing her be accepted in this way pleased me enormously, let me tell you <em>(this made the Hank Hill in me happy, btw, I tell you what. – Jacob)</em>. By the end of the day nearly every lifter had come by for a talk and words of appraisal for our lifting execution and lifts.</p>
<p>The camaraderie at the meet was exceptional and there was no rivalry at all to be found.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">Post-Meet Impressions</span></strong></p>
<p>My girlfriend claimed this was the most fun and friendly competition she had ever entered (having experience from competition in martial arts, gymnastics, dog and horse sports).</p>
<p>She was shocked how well-mannered (and often highly educated) the lifters were. No less than 2 lifters out of 20 had a PhD. Also, she received compliments that her back position was very good, without anybody knowing that she had such grave problems in her spine only months before.</p>
<p>She had an amazing time and felt accepted from the first moment. Besides constantly bombarding me with questions about how her new training schedule will look, she’s registered for the next comp on March 2nd. I’m enormously happy for her and hope that we’ll continue to have such a great time as a couple in this sport. I can recommend it to anyone.</p>

<p>Video of Bert and Marijke’s attempts:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgW8Ok0eaI0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>_I hope everyone learned something from Bert and Marijke’s experience. Training a significant other can be much more difficult than Bert let on, but can also be extremely rewarding. My lady friend is capable of hitting 10 reps with what she hit at her first meet now, but those early days weren’t easy, though she did experience a lot of camaraderie when she entered her first few meets, including USAPL Nationals. Ladies, I’d lofe to hear from you about your experiences as you got into lifting. Let’s get more females involved with competitions, and spread the word about how rewarding being 70sBig can be. I will always be a huge proponent of females competing, because I have seen the smile that ensues. Get big! _</p>

  <p>Fridays are an opportunity to reflect back on the week here at 70sBig. We look over the posts as a community, but we also look back as individuals – at our training, nutrition, and recovery.</p>
<p>I’m trying to bring back “Ladies’ Mondays,” and had a great opportunity this week with Bert and Marijke, his lady friend, as they talked about <a href="/blog/2013/02/berts-lady-friend-part-one/">her introduction to heavy lifting</a>, and her growing love of Powerlifting as a sport. This coming Monday, I’ll share with you Bert’s recap of her first meet. Spoiler alert: She kicked some ass.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, <a href="/blog/2013/02/excuses-no/">Aaron’s 2<sup>nd</sup> post</a> on the site proved to be a huge hit, and an inspiration for many of us. Justin has often talked about how any <a href="/blog/2012/06/every-man-can-squat-405/">motivated man can squat 405</a>. Aaron’s post told us about how he did more than that…102 days after breaking his back. He got a little reckless, sure, but isn’t that what this site is all about?</p>
<p>How reckless did you get this week? What PR’s did you smash? If you didn’t, why not? How’s your <a href="/blog/2013/02/paleo-for-lifters-e-book-release/">nutrition</a>? Did you make it a point to get 8 hours of <a href="/blog/2012/12/importance-of-sleep/">sleep</a> a night? Did you stretch? Did you follow your program, and <a href="/blog/2012/01/logging-progress/">log your work</a>?</p>
<p>You guys know RoryT. He competes as a 181, and is a dream to coach. I’ve written about him on the site before, but in the spirit of PR Friday, I thought I’d share this video of his squats last Saturday, when he DEMOLISHED 460 for 7 reps, for a dece PR.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfHh-HLUE2c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>In case you missed it on twitter and facebook, here’s our own Mike B discussing some important meet strategies. He’ll be at the Arnold again this year, competing alongside Big Chris, Matt Nolan, and AC, and over the next few weeks, we’ll be discussing that quite a bit more. You can also follow along with his log (and the other fellas’) at the top of the page.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/aW24s9T3omo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Matt Nolan hit a PR this week – he pulled 657 for a triple as he prepares for the Arnold. Must have been the shirt.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYOSfPaArF4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Talk about your PRs below. Update us on your status, and when your next contest is. You have committed to a meet of some sort, haven’t you? You think these guys got this awesome without competing? Your friends are tired of seeing you post PRs on your facebook page, but the 70sBig community cares. Except Brent.</p>

<p>In fact, I liked this pic so much I made a replica of Doyle Kenady’s shirt. You can ogle it, and even buy it, at my <a title="Buy Stuff. Squat more. " href="http://liftheavyshit.spreadshirt.com/" target="_blank">LiftHeavyShit</a> store.</p>
<p>That’s all for today, folks. Next week, we’ll not only have some updates on Bert and Marijke, but we’ll also have an article or two on training the posterior chain (including Weightlifting-specific advice), and some really awesome historical stuff that I’m putting together, including pics similar to the one above, but even cooler. You’re welcome. Keep the reader submissions coming, too – I have a few, but the more I have, the more I can share. Have a great weekend – Get Big.</p>

Some say, &#8216;Half of life is just showing up,&#8217; but the other half is putting out, and getting the work done. 50% is a failing score in real life; just showing up isn’t enough.&#8221; Well here&#8217;s the proof. Here&#8217;s his story about how <strong>he broke his fucking back&#8230;and squatted 425 pounds 102 days later. </strong>Life is full of potential excuses. It&#8217;s up to you if you use them, or if you get up and do something. &#8211; Jacob </em>
</p>
<p>I had already surpassed my own expectations for the competition. I already knew what everyone else squatted, and I had 2<sup>nd</sup> place locked down no matter what number I put up. After talking with Justin for about a week, going over training prep and weights for the meet, we had settled on a good 3 lift progression. Justin warned me a couple times, “This is pretty ambitious. Those are big jumps for a raw lifter.” He was right; we had planned on going 350, 380, and 405, and those were pretty large jumps. But, as sometimes things like this work, I got amped up and started feeding off the competition. I watched lifter after lifter fail at weights that weren’t anywhere near my totals. I turned to my friend Mike and said, “Hey man, this is crazy, but I am freaking amped. I want to jump to 405 for my second and 440 for my third.”</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “do you think it’s safe? Do you think you have it in you? Why don’t you go 425 for your third?”</p>
<p>I immediately left him and went to the judges. I drove 405 out of the hole hard. The lift was never in question. So there I stood, ready for my third, staring down 425.</p>
<p>Let me back up. 102 days prior to this competition, I was lying in a hospital bed. I had taken a pretty nasty fall, and the doctors were concerned. A good doctor friend of mine was in charge of my overall care; she was not optimistic.</p>
<p>“Listen- you might never be allowed to fly again, let alone jump. I can’t even tell you if you’re going to be able to run, or walk up stairs without pain. What happened was very serious. We are going to do everything we can, but you have to be prepared for the worst possible scenario. This could be it.“</p>

    That&#8217;s what a broken back and a little crack looks like. The yellow tint is from jaundice related to all the broken tissue.
  </p>
</div>
<p>She was right. The tally read like this- I had broken the transverse processes off of everything south of L1 in my spine. I compressed 3 vertebrae 18% each in my upper back in between my shoulder blades. I had fractures throughout my iliac crest on both sides of my pelvis. I had hit the ground with such force I had offset my pelvis in my sacroiliac joint, and had instability as a result. I broke 5 ribs, separated my left shoulder, and damaged so much tissue that rhabdomyolysis was a serious concern for 5 days after the injury.</p>
<p>I spent a week in the hospital and was released to my home to continue my recovery on the strict guidance I could do nothing – nothing at all – for a period of 6 weeks. Lay down, wear a special brace, no lifting anything-not even my kids- and nothing but slow, careful walking. “If you don’t do this exactly as we prescribe, you may never be the same,” my doctor told me as I was leaving the hospital. I had narrowly avoided surgery.</p>
<p>So I played by the rules. For 6 weeks, I wore that stupid brace and I took it easy. For 6 weeks, I got more and more angry. The first to go was the pain meds. They made me so sick it was not worth the vomit for the 4 hour relief in pain. For 6 weeks, I talked to friends who called just to tell me how lucky I was. For 6 weeks, doctor after doctor saw me, and told me how lucky I had been, and what a long road I had ahead of me. At the end of 6 weeks, I saw my doctor again. She asked, “What do you plan to do for rehab? How many days a week?”</p>
<p>“Seven days a week, Doc. I’ll do it on my own. I want to be back on team in 6 months. It’s April now – I want to take my PT test and start running on team by November 1.”</p>
<p>She was a mix of dumbfounded and extremely angry. “That is unrealistic. You are setting yourself up for failure! What is it you think you’re going to do?!?” I was going to do the same thing I did before the injury, the thing I think saved my life. I was going to get underneath a barbell and lift.</p>
<p>For the next 3 months I learned how to walk again. I had to take very short steps; any time I slipped or found myself off balance, the pain was excruciating. I couldn’t run, I had issues lifting my knees above my hips, and I got so sore from minor things some days I honestly thought it would be better if I just passed out and woke up a day later. I had nearly zero thoracic mobility. I couldn’t sleep well for weeks on account of the broken ribs. Nothing was easy, but I started squatting again. It was the most embarrassing day I have ever had in a gym, squatting just the bar. 45 lbs. That was my work set for the day – 45lbs for 10 reps for 5 sets.</p>
<p>I kept at it, doing 5/3/1. I made gains. I had setbacks. As the pain slowly got less, my lifting got better and better. I had to focus on perfect form; I couldn’t afford to tweak anything or hurt myself worse. I did mobility work before and after my workouts. I stretched all day long. I started to feel like myself again. For a while, I could only do the elliptical machine for cardio, but I graduated to the bike, then to the rower, then to very slow walking on the treadmill.</p>
<p>And that finds us back where I started this article. 102 days after the injury, 77 days after I was allowed to start working out, there was a squat competition on base. I had been having a bad couple of weeks, and I wanted to do something reckless to show all the doubters in my life – of which I had many – just how healthy and strong I was.</p>
<p>Justin and I had set a hard limit of 405, seeing as I hadn’t gone over 365 since I hurt myself. We decided 405 was a victory, and that’s what I needed to shoot for. When I drove that second attempt of 405 through the ceiling of the gym I was ecstatic. Motivated. Angry. I wanted to breath smoke.</p>
<p>So, as I prepared for the lift at 425, I knew I had already won, and things might just be ok after all. As you can see in the video, I look an inch high. I laugh when I see this video; I immediately start taking my belt off and shaking my head. The judges counted the lift, but I didn’t.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/roY-6QLxSIU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two months after this lift I jumped out of a plane again with my team. I was cleared in mid December to start my normal duties with no restrictions. I went from a doctor telling me I might not walk correctly ever again to full “up” status in a period of 7 months. For the record, I credit the team of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals who helped me through this. It was a team effort, and every single person involved deserves credit.</p>
<p>At the present, I have pain every day. I have to do mobility work every day, and I need to focus on form and listen to my body. But what I learned from this event in my life I will never forget. I truly feel the strength I had, as a result of 3 solid years of linear progression barbell programs, saved my life. Many doctors were astonished I was able to take such a hit and somehow come out with the “few” injuries I had. Every time they asked me what I did for exercise, I would simply respond “I lift heavy weights. It makes me much harder to kill.” Some would chuckle; some would just shake their head.</p>
<p>Countless doctors, friends, co workers and others hear this story and ask what I was feeling like, what was running through my head when this all went down. When I was lying in that hospital bed, what was I thinking? My only response, in fact the very first thing I said to my doctor when she asked me what my plan was, was “I am going to come back from this stronger, and you need to lift to be stronger. That’s what I am going to do.”</p>
<p>And that’s what I did.</p>

  <p>_Editor’s Note: In 2012, Justin spent a majority of Mondays discussing female-specific topics. Eventually, he pretty much ran out of material and lately, they’ve trickled down a bit, though I believe they are still very popular. I hope to bring these back with a vengeance. Not only do I really enjoy coaching female Powerlifters (<a title="Remember this article?" href="/blog/2012/11/hyde-park-gym-ladies-at-the-longhorn-open/" target="_blank">remember this article</a>?), I also love the positive message that we, as a community, try to put out there for our female lifting friends. Readers, especially females, <a href="/submissions/" target="_blank">please send me</a> your Monday posts and let’s do this._<em>Today’s article is the first guest post by Bert, who recently coached his lady friend to her first PL meet. This week he discusses some of the experiences and difficulties they went through in her early training, and next week, we’ll get a full recap from her first meet. – Jacob</em></p>
<p>In October 2012, I met my new girlfriend. Unexpectedly, when she first set foot in my home gym, she immediately fell in love with it: the rings, the weights, the medicine balls, the kettlebells. I introduced her to the squat, press, chinup and deadlift, showed her a few training videos (powerlifting, weightlifting and Crossfit-type conditioning) and she knew what she wanted to do: powerlift.</p>

    Bert&#8217;s Home Gym
  </p>
</div>
<p>She was built to lift: 5’1″, with thick joints and a broad athletic background that ranged from equestrian vaulting (gymnastics on a horse ) to judo.</p>
<p><strong>However, she had a few challenges:</strong></p>
<p><em>Lower Back:</em> falling from a horse caused her to crack a few vertebrae and suffer from lower back pain that impeded her from standing for prolonged periods of time or participate in most sports. Her physicians had her doing plenty of balancing, exactly what a girl who is able to stand on one leg on a galloping horse needs to recover (sarcasm). This, of course, did nothing.</p>
<p><em>Neck:</em> a whiplash that was caused by a car crash, caused her neck pain, even though this crash occured six months earlier.</p>
<p><em>Digestion:</em> due to eosinophilic gastroenteritis, her private and professional life was disturbed. She often suffered from intestinal attacks that caused heavy sweating, fever and intestinal drama and gassiness. Endoscopy and other allergenic tests revealed no gluten or lactose-intolerance, nor adverse reactions to any other food. She was, however, unable to eat most fruit, meat and vegetables without trouble. Instead she relied on pasta, bread and candy. The saddest part, for me, was that she stated that “she simply didn’t like eating.”</p>
<p><em>Weight gain:</em> she had gained 10 kilos (22 pounds) from cortisone injections meant to deal with the intestinal inflammation. She stopped the treatment and was able to lose 5 kilos on her own so far, by running. The PCOS possibly also caused her to be slightly insulin-resistant.</p>
<p><em>Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies:</em> her gut didn’t produce ferritin (a protein that stores iron) and vitamin B12, forcing her to receive it intravenously via monthly visits to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Diet Changes</strong></p>
<p>After making sure that she was willing to go all out with this, I modified her diet by having her eat two to three meals a day. Since she didn’t like to eat breakfast, I had her skip it, conforming with the 16/8 intermittent fasting protocol. This reduced the bloating immensely. After some evaluation, it turned out that pasta (her former favourite food), first and foremost, caused the digestive attacks. Secondly, food that contained a high amount of gluten (most breads) and processed food were culprits.</p>
<p>After an adaptive period, she found out that she seldom suffered from the intestinal troubles and was even able to eat meat and fruits again, which she had missed dearly. Her skin also cleared up and some minor joint inflammation she had also disappeared, most likely due to reduced systemic inflammation.</p>
<p><strong>Training Changes</strong></p>
<p>I had her begin a simple routine, alternating A and B workouts three times a week. On the other days she ran with her dogs or went for a long walk. She used linear progression for the first two months with only minor modifications. I had her overhead pressing dumbbells at first, until she was strong enough to use a barbell.</p>
<p>A: Squat, OHP, RDL, Chins</p>
<p>B: Squat, Bench, Hip Thrust, Chins</p>
<p>Other assistance exercises included hyperextensions, (more) hip thrusts, rack pulls, and abdominal exercises.Since she had a very weak posterior chain (yet strong anterior chain), I had her do many lower back, glute and hamstring exercises. Deadlifting was at first impossible, as she was unable to hold the required back position throughout the movement, even with an empty bar. RDLs and Rack Pulls strengthened this back position. After two months she switched from conventional to sumo deadlifts, which suited her back and leverages (short arms and legs) much better.</p>
<p><strong>Powerlifting Meet</strong></p>
<p>After two months, she had made a radical physical transformation: she had lost weight, gained muscle, improved her lifestyle (by not having to go to the restroom so often) and had regained her love for food. In addition, her confidence was soaring.</p>
<p>She now had her mind set on doing a powerlifting meet. Her routine wasn’t a typical powerlifting routine as I felt she still had much room to improve things like overhead strength and other physical qualities that would assist her powerlifts regardless.</p>
<p>She was now doing the following:</p>
<p>Monday: Squat, Bench, Sumo DL, Chins</p>
<p>Wednesday: Squat, OHP, Kettlebell DL, Chins</p>
<p>Friday: Squat, Bench, Rack Pull, Chins</p>
<p>Assistance work remained the same. She did conditioning with sprints or circuits once a week, on Saturdays.</p>
<p><strong>Strength Increases and the Future</strong></p>
<p>After three months of training, she was able to do the following, at a bodyweight of 55kgs (121lbs), with only weightlifting shoes, no belt:</p>
<p>Squat: 67.5 kg (148.5 lbs)</p>
<p>Paused Bench Press: 40 kg (88 lbs)</p>
<p>Sumo Deadlift: 65 kg (143 lbs)</p>
<p>In addition, she can do four strict chinups, after starting out with zero. She’s also able to run faster and longer, while training less. After being told to “live with” her conditions by many a doctor or physician and dietician, she was able to improve her jest for life, her appearance and her confidence. I hope she continues to improve and that others will be able to find inspiration in her journey, and join in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>_Tune in next Monday for a recap of her first meet! _</p>

  <p>In late 2007 I shifted my training focus from two years of  “bodybuilding style stuff” back to an emphasis on performance. In early 2008 I started doing CrossFit exclusively for several months. As I was studying Kinesiology material in school, I also soaked up training and nutrition information at home. I read Loren Cordain’s “The Paleo Diet” and implemented it immediately. I quickly found that lots of protein and fat with controlled carbs was not only optimal for performance, but also helped me gain almost ten pounds of lean body mass_ _in a month even though I was doing CrossFit. I was meticulous. In the beginning of 2009 I focused on strength training and put an emphasis on low quality, yet high calorie foods in high quantities. I ate like this for 18 months and gained weight and got stronger, but I always felt a bit sluggish. Since the middle of 2010, I’ve steadily experimented and progressed my diet into something that uses the Paleo diet as a base, but provides enough calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat to fuel strength and conditioning training.</p>
<p>I constantly aim to improve my knowledge and how I teach nutrition on 70sBig.com has evolved over time. It’s possible to consume enough macronutrients and calories to recover from training and do so with quality foods that make our bodies more efficient and healthy; increased efficiency improves training recovery.</p>
<p>The result is that I maintain a sub-10% body fat while hovering between 210 and 215 pounds and can perform the following any day of the week: squat 450 for reps, press 225, deadlift 500, snatch 125kg, and clean and jerk 155kg. I don’t like humble-bragging, but these methods are effective not only for me, but lifters and trainees I work with.</p>
<p><em>Paleo for Lifters is</em> an e-book I’ve been writing off and on for months and is about 26,000 words and 60 pages. It surpasses the length of <em><a href="/books/the-texas-method-part-1/" target="_blank">Texas Method: Part 1</a></em> by several thousand words but isn’t as big as <em><a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Advanced</a></em>, which sits at about 35,000 words. While the TM books were riddled with figures, graphs, and images, _Paleo for Lifters _is mostly just old fashioned text and explanation. Those who have read my books in the past know that I don’t put out crappy e-books, and this book is chock-full of useful information.</p>

<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>1 —  Introduction</p>
<p>2 — Nutrition Basics</p>
<p>3 — Why Paleo?</p>
<p>4 — Implementation</p>
<p>5 — Tips and Such</p>
<p>6 — A Final Word</p>
<p>The early chapters explain the basics of nutrition physiology as well as how much food a lifter, athlete, or trainee needs. Chapter 3 explains why the Paleolithic Diet is a good foundation for quality food and how it can help reduce systemic inflammation and therefore improve training recovery. Chapter 4 teaches readers how to use the Paleo diet to get enough quantities of protein, carbs, and fat and even how to tweak it based on body type and goal. Section topics include questionable and acceptable food choices (that differ from Paleo zealot recommendations), supplements, types of trainees, and a step-by-step guide to improving food quality. Chapter 5 ties up loose ends by covering topics like how to effectively use “cheat meals” (a goofy term that I use for consistency’s sake), how to read food labels, cooking tips, eating on a budget, eating while traveling, timing food intake with training, and how to tweak carbs intake, and information on sleep and hydration.</p>
<p>There are no recipes in this book, though there is a section that gives information on learning how to cook.</p>
