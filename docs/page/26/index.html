<p>The NFL championship game is this Sunday and it has turned into big media frenzy. I’ve personally avoided anything about the game since the media hype can produce a huge let down on Super Bowl Sunday. But, more importantly, do you give a shit about this game? I love football, grew up playing and watching it, and I’ll be watching this Sunday, but the celebrity frenzy can be laborious.</p>
<p>What about pro athletes? Do you really give a damn about them? Are they clowns paid to perform for you? Do you care that Raven’s linebacker Ray Lewis possibly murdered or witnessed a murder on the weekend of Super Bowl 34? Does a different set of ethics apply to famous people?</p>
<p>If a white trash chick skipped trial 20 times, violated probation, then made some shit up about not showing up to court and everyone found out she was lying, and then was <em>not</em> sent to jail, how would you feel? Cause that’s the life of Lindsey Lohan.</p>
<p>And more importantly, do you care if Beyonce lip-syncs the national anthem?</p>
<p>Who wins the game?</p>
<p>These are the questions America needs to know!</p>

I joined the Air Force after spending some time bouncing around Ohio where I grew up. I was always good enough at sports to make the varsity team – I swam and played water polo – but I wasn’t good enough to pay for school or to make a living out of it. I wasn&#8217;t challenged enough by college to care to keep going. For about 8 months in the start of 2001, I talked to recruiters, asked what they could offer me, took some placement tests, and scored well enough to get my pick of jobs. I wasn&#8217;t sure I wanted to go in despite coming from a family heavily entrenched in military and civil service. I wasted a lot of time that year. Then September 11, 2001 came and went, and like so many other young men and women I was gone a month later.
</p>
<p>I chose the Air Force to try out for Pararescue, or PJ – a special operations job in the Air Force where operatives are tasked with recovery and medical treatment of personnel in humanitarian and combat environments. It’s arguably the hardest Special Operations job in the United States military. I was attracted by the difficulty, the attrition rate (more than 90% fail), and the mission. Saving lives, bringing home fallen Eagles, no matter the cost. “That others may live” is the motto. Small teams are asked to do impossible things only to succeed time and time again. It’s mentally challenging, physically demanding, and packed full of the world’s best training opportunities. It took all of 5 seconds for my recruiter to tell me about the job before I wanted to sign papers.</p>
<p>This is usually the point in the story where I tell you how I completed selection, realize my dreams, but it’s not. I failed the selection course for Pararescue, called “The Indoctrination Course”, or colloquially “INDOC”. I did not have the maturity, physical skills or mental preparedness needed to be a PJ, and I found that out in the harshest way over the course of my first year in the military. I love the saying, “failure is not an option.” I assure you, it most certainly <em>is</em> an option.</p>
<p>I spent 5 years in Washington, D.C. working a very cool but very “desk” job. I excelled, made a couple stripes, and was well set up for a very “easy” career in the Air Force. I loved the people I worked with, I loved the Air Force, and I loved my life. I even got married, had a baby – the whole deal.</p>
<p>At 3 a.m., on the night I graduated from Basic Army Airborne School, my wife looked at me as she held my then-three-week-old daughter, and said the one thing that changed all of our lives.</p>
<p>“It made you want to go back, didn’t it? Did jump school make you want to try INDOC again?”</p>
<p>I responded with some really pansy type, “Uh, babe, you know…”</p>
<p>“Shut up” was the only response from my wife. “Put the packet in. Let’s go back. But I am changing the locks on the doors, and you aren’t coming home to this family unless you pass. You can get your new keys at graduation. You are gambling on our lives here, and I won’t bet on anything but a sure bet. Let’s do this.”</p>
<p>Fast forward to now. 8 years after that conversation, I am a PJ with multiple combat deployments, and international SOF experience. I just returned from a deployment, and I am getting ready for the next one, as usual.</p>
<p>But now the question: why did I spend 300 words telling you this, and what does it have to do with 70’s Big?</p>
<p>Well, it has everything to do with it. Along my journey, a couple resounding truths kept my head right and kept me on the right track.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have to stand up, do the work, and grind out every day of your life. Some say, “Half of life is just showing up,” but the other half is putting out, and getting the work done. 50% is a failing score in real life; just showing up isn’t enough.</li>
<li>The second you lose sight of item 1, someone will call you on it and you will pay a penalty. In my line of work, that could conceivably mean a serious injury or death – or the worst possible scenario, that I would be unable to answer the call when it comes. It seems as if I got those two consequences in the wrong order. Trust me, I didn’t.</li>
</ol>
<p>These lessons were taught to me at the gym. Not during some “cool guy” combat scenario or during a movie-type scene; I learned these things under a bar. Trying to find a way to push into a max-effort set; showing up an hour early to make sure I get my mobility work in; getting up hours before the sun because I don’t have enough time in my day; or refusing to miss a weight or a progression. These lessons were taught to me in the most unforgiving fashion possible. The weight is constant and the entry in your journal for that day is a pass/fail event. Would you like to skip today’s workout, or mail it in and only do 75% of what you had programmed that day? That’s fine. Just realize you will not be strong and you’ve increased your chance of failing. If you are ok with that, well, I’m not sure we are going to get along.</p>
<p>Throughout my career I’ve loved learning and passing knowledge on. Long ago I saw the value of strength training and have never looked back. Three years ago I found my way to 70’s Big and saw a community of like-minded individuals and have been an avid follower since. When I was presented the opportunity to contribute in any way, I was amped.</p>
<p>So, here we are. Hopefully, I can contribute some quality articles. I want to bring my military and Special Operations experience as well as my experience coaching athletes of all shapes and sizes – males, females, special operators, intel officers, housewives and grandparents. Hopefully my experience can help make 70’s Big readers better.</p>
<p>If not, at least I “showed up”, and that’s at least worth half credit.</p>

  <p>70’s Big started as a joke six months before the site launched in September of 2009. After coining the phrase, our group of friends saw 70’s Big in everything we did. Eating a one pound burger was 70’s Big. Getting eight hours of sleep was 70’s Big. Air guitaring was 70’s Big. Anything that pushed us towards the goal of being stronger and bigger was 70’s Big.</p>
<p>The attitude of 70’s Big has been in my life for almost four years, but the mentality has been around longer. Shouting the phrase, “Never miss a chance to get better!” and following it with impromptu exercise was one of my favorite public jokes. See two chairs together? Get a few dips in. See a sidewalk? Get some walking lunges. Never miss a chance to get better.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember shouting the phrase outside a bar on Halloween in 2008 when AC and I dressed up as speed walkers. I drunkenly shouted the phrase, jumped on an awning, and started doing pull-ups. When I landed, I looked down to see blood seeping out of a gash on my hand. “Never missing a chance” has its consequences, but this didn’t stop me from speed walking up and down the bar or doing jumping jacks in the corner.</p>

<p>This “joke” is a derivative of a long-time belief I established at an early age: people should not only never plateau in life, but they should never be satisfied with plateauing. The very idea should make them vomit.</p>
<p>Some people hang their hat on past accomplishments as if it gives them the right to complacency. **“Success” is not something that a person ever qualifies for, but a state of mind that results from honestly striving for it. **</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t think anything I’ve done is impressive. Graduating college, coaching people, or establishing this website — to me these are byproducts of the work I’ve put in. I don’t ever focus on what I’ve achieved, but focus on what I could have done better. And there’s a <em>lot</em> that I could have done better. I don’t dwell or fester on the  bad, but use it as a tool to improve. Just like in lifting, <a href="/blog/2010/08/learn-from-your-mistakes/" target="_blank">if something goes wrong</a>, figure out why, and then work towards rectifying the problem. Everyone has good traits that clash with flaws, yet it’s overcoming the flaws that allow us to show our quality while working towards success.</p>
<p>My intention with this website has always been to educate and subsequently motivate. If that means I have to act like a fuck-head to get your attention, then that’s something I’m willing to do. If you get nothing else from 70’s Big, I hope it’s the motivation to bust your ass in training, but it’s my sincerest hope that this rubs off into the rest of your life. Attack your life goals with the same intensity you use during a 3RM squat attempt. <a href="/blog/2013/01/mental-workout-pr-friday-25-jan-2013/" target="_blank">Train your mind</a>, speak foreign languages, study history, understand philosophy, play musical instruments — independently _think _and actively learn to better yourself. It’s no different than training your body and equally important.</p>
<p>Above all…<em>never</em> miss a chance to get better.</p>

<p>The history of nutrition and strength training has roots in hearty caloric-dense meals – with good reason. Strength training places a toll on the body that requires adequate amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. There are stories from strength training legends that talk about how young, hard training men would go to the local diner for cheese burgers and milk shakes to recover from training. Other stories detail the amount of eggs, milk, cream, ice cream, and protein powder that they would throw into their shakes. This is what was necessary to get bigger and stronger, so that’s what you should do too. Right?</p>
<p>The old school nutritional paradigm is based on the misconception that dirty foods are the only foods that can help someone gain muscle and get stronger. The mindset probably evolved from the stories told in powerlifting magazines of super heavyweights. After all, the heaviest guys are the strongest guys, so their dietary habits are naturally highlighted. While a lifter like Lamar Gant is impressive, his 688lb deadlift at 132lbs pales in comparison to Bill Kazmeir’s 886.7lb raw deadlift at a body weight of over 300lbs. Furthermore, the impressive eating stories printed in strength training literature typically highlight young men during pubescent training. Teenagers and young adults have fiery metabolisms due to their high testosterone levels and are able to convert massive amounts of calories into solid muscular gain.</p>
<p>Every adult in Western society soon finds out that their teenage eating habits will result in fat accumulation through each aging decade. When people get old, their metabolisms slow and their body adapts to stress slower. “Body fat is 90% diet,” is a common phrase that has risen from trainees that are disappointed with their body composition despite hard training in the gym. Lean, athletic physiques require a lot of effort and will power.</p>
<p>Quality food doesn’t just yield a lean physique; it plays a role in how efficiently the body works. There will always be new fad diets that claim to lose weight quickly and easily – nutrition is a habit that is extremely difficult to change and capitalizing on laziness funnels money to pseudo-nutritionists. There have been huge nutritional advances in the last two decades that are yet to permeate mainstream nutritional and fitness knowledge. It’s possible to combine the lessons from unconventional nutrition knowledge with strength and conditioning to have an efficient dietary approach that will provide enough calories for recovery and gaining muscle without superfluous fat gain. <em>Paleo for Lifters</em> — a new book I have been working on that will be out very soon — will show how to do this in a variety of scenarios with guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Please voice any concerns or questions you have about trainees, athletes, and lifters using the Paleo diet as a nutritional foundation to achieve their goals.</strong></p>

<p>Recently Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, signed an order that <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/24/panetta-opens-combat-roles-to-women/" target="_blank">opens combat arms jobs to women</a>. Previously, women were barred from jobs that were tasked with combat involvement, though they could serve in support units that often found themselves in combat (mostly in the Iraq war).</p>
<p>It’s a little known fact that women have not only been fighting, but dying in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of the 6,600+ service members that have died, 152 have been women (not including non-lethal casualties). Now they will have the opportunity to qualify for combat arms jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Allow me to point out that I don’t think I’m fully qualified to have an opinion on this topic since I am neither an active duty service member or a combat veteran.</strong> Take that into context when reading my opinion.</p>
<p>Personally I don’t have a problem with women serving in combat roles, <em>so long as they can meet the standard — a standard that has not been lowered for their benefit</em>. It would be a disservice to both women and men in a combat unit if a woman was pushed through training without having to meet the same minimum standards of everyone else, regardless of sex. It would put the woman and her teammates in jeopardy. Pentagon officials agree and have repeatedly expressed that standards will not be lowered to facilitate female prospects.</p>
<p>In truth, I think most or all women would agree with that sentiment (and the military women I know have echoed this). Women make up 14% of the 1.4 million active duty force. Of the available women, there is probably only a small percentage of them that would physically qualify for a combat arms job. But what does “qualify” actually mean? Right now it means passing the course (e.g. infantry school) while passing the official physical assessments in the course. But the Pentagon is asking the services to define what the actual physical requirements of each job are (e.g. infantry may require pulling a 300 pound load x distance in y time — turning these expectations into actual graded events). I interpret that as solidifying what “the standard” is so that a woman (or man) knows exactly what is expected of them and if they do not perform up to that standard, they will not pass the course. It will prevent law suits (that have previously occurred) from women arguing they were removed from training simply because they are female — quite an ambiguous and difficult argument for either side.</p>
<p>It’s useful to obtain the opinion of women who have served in combat, especially women who have worked in a job where combat was more prevalent than a support element getting ambushed. I read an article the other day where a female NCO who has been in combat said something along the lines of, “I hope that women will join combat arms because they truly want to instead of doing it just because they can.” (My apologies, I know this is shitty reporting to not cite my source, but I couldn’t find the article). It’s a fair point — do it because it’s what you desire, not because you want to make a point about gender issues.</p>
<p>The most poignant female opinion I’ve seen on this topic was from an <a href="http://sofrep.com/8339/female-cst-special-forces-enabler-speaks/" target="_blank">interview with a woman serving on a Cultural Support Team (CST) on SOFREP.com</a> — men are at times barred from interacting with women and children in Afghanistan, so a CST woman is attached to a special operations team to do so. She was attached to a 3rd Group SF team and was trained for and saw combat during her deployment. She dispels the typical reasons men bring up about women in combat roles (protecting women, cleanliness, sex, etc.) and talks about her experience.</p>
<p>But the most important thing she stresses — more than once — is that standards should be equal for men and women. The women aren’t stupid and know that this is important, and it seems that the DoD is following suit.</p>
<p>To make this quasi-relevant to training, there are obviously different demands between combat arms and desk jobs. Women who aim to perform to standard will need to be strong and emphasize proper technique to make the most out of their likely smaller statures and lack of absolute strength (with respect to a strong male). In other words, if she needs to put things overhead, she’ll need to know how to push-press it. If she is going to drag equipment or a teammate, she’ll need to know to use leverage by dropping her hips low. This strength foundation should be built with compound barbell movements like the squat, press, deadlift, pull-ups/chin-ups, and push-press. Strength and technique will be critical for these women.</p>
<p>Personally I know women who could successfully meet these standards, but the reality is that muscular women who are strong and can ruck all day are not common. A skinny, weak male can get through infantry training by virtue of sucking it up, but a female may need to sharpen her physical attributes to be effective. Nevertheless, I’m sure there will be many good female role models when the changes officially occur.</p>
<p>The change will be slow, but this will be a transitional era for the U.S. military. They will join many other countries in allowing women in combat roles despite being late to the party. It seems like Leon Panetta has the right idea in fairly implementing this policy by saying, “Not everyone is going to be able to be a combat soldier, but everyone is entitled to a chance.”</p>

<p>****I am a firm believer in holistic training throughout life. Developing the body is why we are all here, but improving mental and emotional strength is just as important. We know that mental and emotional aptitude can be a corollary to quality physical training, yet to reach full potential we need dedicated time to develop them — just like strength, conditioning, speed, or agility.</p>
<p>Today we’re focusing on mental capacity. True, some of you may require a level of intellect to conduct your job or deal with your life, but that is akin to believing you can get stronger just by shoveling some dirt and going to work. So let’s take some time out of our day or week to better our minds.</p>
<p>Some of you are already shaking your heads. “I have a wife, kids, work, and training. How can I possibly add anything else to my day?” I’ve always had the mentality that you can dedicate one fifteen minute period of your day to <em>something</em>. There are 96 periods of 15 minutes in a day (4 fifteen minute periods in an hour x 24 hours in a day = 96 fifteen minute periods). You can certainly spend one of those 96 periods — hell, you can spend five dedicated minutes to mental training. So make the time.</p>
<p>Basically you should aim to stimulate your mind with critical thinking. Think of the mind as a muscle, and without this dedicated training it will grow soft and weak. There are several great ways to do this like doing mental math, playing chess, doing sudoku (though I’ve never gotten into them), or solve puzzles. There are many mental math apps available on the iPhone or Droid OS. The one I have gives you two minutes to solve as many simple math problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as you can. The difficulty increases with your prowess. For some people, 737/67 might result in an instantaneous solution, but others whose math skills have grown dusty will need a moment of strained thought.</p>
<p>When I first moved to Texas — and before I became friends with Brent and Chris — I would sit in my house at night and do physics problems until one or two in the morning. They weren’t terribly hard (usually simple alegbra), but I felt it would keep or make me sharp. At least it passed the time when I didn’t have any friends in Texas (Debbie Downer music).</p>

</p>
<p>Playing chess is a fantastic and stimulating activity. I have seen studies that say there isn’t a correlation between IQ and chess ability, but we’re not intending to use chess as a means to a higher IQ. We’re using it to stimulate the critical thinking areas of our mind. I’m an inexperienced chess player, but when I play I have to consider the implications of my move and subsequent possible actions in my opponent. I take entirely too long to make a move, so I suspect that playing with a clock will force me to speed the analyzing process up and take higher risks in the match. I believe that doing this regularly, and under pressure, will only help develop this “analyze, plan, and act” process in other areas of my life.</p>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger’s father would force him and his brother to do math problems when they were boys. And throughout his life Arnold would play chess — even on the plane while serving as the Governor of California. Mental strength is a necessary tool for success, so let’s keep our skills sharp by spending a few minutes of dedicated training each day.</p>
<p><strong>Questions: What mental training techniques have you used in the past? What do you currently use? What are other good ways to train the mind?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Consultations</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who have inquired about consultations, they were on a hiatus through the holidays. They are resuming and I’m pleased to introduce <strong>Chris Riley</strong> to the consultation team. You can read his profile <a href="/chris/index.php/about/" target="_blank">here</a>, and you can currently contact the consultation team at <a href="mailto:Consultations@70sbig.com" target="_blank"><a href="mailto:Consultations@70sbig.com">Consultations@70sbig.com</a></a> for information. **Note that there may be a waiting list and it may take time to get to your e-mail. **</p>
<p><strong>New Writers</strong></p>
<p>I’m pleased to welcome several writers to 70sBig.com. You have heard me talk about them or have seen their posts in the past, and I’m glad to call all of them good friends. They will be assigned to a specific sport and will report news as well as provide their analysis or opinion on the sport. The new writers and their duties are:</p>
<p><strong>Jacob Cloud</strong> — Powerlifting, Editor</p>
<p><strong>Mike Battaglino</strong> — Strongman</p>
<p><strong>Jacob Tsypkin</strong> — Olympic Weightlifting</p>
<p><strong>Brian Smith</strong> — General sports</p>
<p>I feel that designating people to cover a sport will provide 70’s Big readers with a more comprehensive look at that sport. This will only encourage readers to be fans of the sport <strong>and will help grow the sport</strong>, but it will also help motivate readers to also compete. All three of the sport specific writers love the sport they are following and regularly coach or compete in it. They have the freedom to report news, interview athletes, or profile a athletes — whatever they see fit. Expect to see more content on each sport since having a person dedicated to each will be infinitely better than me trying to cover them all at once. Each writer will soon have their own 70’s Big e-mail address to accept related content pertinent to their sport or interests.</p>
<p><strong>Reader Submissions</strong></p>
<p>When I started this site I intended it to be driven by reader submitted content. That has been partially true as I often create posts based on inquiries or material sent to me. However, for the first time I am formally opening 70’s Big to reader submitted articles. This doesn’t mean anything and everything will be accepted. Your submission must:</p>
<p>– Not exceed 1,000 words in length, and preferably be closer to 500.</p>
<p>– Include a visual aid (either an image that is under 500×500 pixels or a YouTube video) and cite where this visual came from.</p>
<p>– Be concise with good grammar and punctuation.</p>
<p>– Include a short, one paragraph summary (like an abstract) at the beginning of the e-mail to explain what the submission is about.</p>
<p>– Send submissions to <a href="mailto:Submissions@70sBig.com" target="_blank"><a href="mailto:Submissions@70sBig.com">Submissions@70sBig.com</a></a></p>
<p>If any of the rules above are not followed, then the submission will be deleted. <strong>Jacob Cloud is also now an editor</strong> and will oversee reader submissions with my help. If a submission is poor in quality, irrelevant, pointless, or not interesting or funny, we reserve the right to not use the submission. It’s okay to submit things that are in conflict with my objective and subjective training methodology or opinions, but you will need to make a compelling argument for doing so (this sentence is here to show you that we won’t be denying conflicting pieces just because they disagree with us). Time is a valuable thing; do not waste ours with poor articles. If you are worried about wasting your own time, it would be acceptable to send an e-mail asking if we’re interested in your topic.</p>
<p>Any or all of the above rules could change the more Jacob and I discuss it or sift through submissions. Have fun with it. Most of the people that read 70’s Big are great people who love to train and are really funny, so if you choose to write something, direct it at such an audience.</p>

  <p>The majority of people in what I call “the online training communities” are general strength and conditioning trainees. That means they are lifting, doing high intensity conditioning, but not much else. They may be competing in powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting or CrossFit, but those sports or competitions feature testing movements that are repeated over and over in training, albeit in different variations. Unfortunately some athletic elements are neglected, no matter how much CrossFit wants to claim athletic supremacy or strength trainees want to claim magical athletic prowess just because they are stronger.</p>
<p><em>(Here’s a completely inarticulate video about agility ladders. Watch Chris on the ladder — he’s very deft for a 310 pound guy)</em></p>

<p>General strength and conditioning training doesn’t include many dynamic movements that require re-positioning the body in space. Or any activities that require reaction to visual or other sensory stimulus. And there especially aren’t any rotation or lateral shear stresses on the spine, though we won’t be getting into that today. Instead, we’re focusing on those important athletic skills under the umbrella of “mobility” like agility, speed, balance, and overall kinesthetic coordination. These skills aren’t present in most general types of training, but are prevalent in high school, collegiate, and professional sport training programs. And I think it’s something everyone should utilize.</p>
<p>Agility, or foot work, drills are the easiest activity to add to your training. They aren’t significantly stressful, they can be done in a short amount of time, and can be done as part of your warm-up. Agility drills will also be a safe way for your lower leg structures to adapt to actual activity — stuff other than walking around and squatting. The drills will develop overall coordination, improve balance, and do so dynamically. It’s one thing to think, “I have good balance” when your feet are planted firmly under your shoulders, but it’s another thing entirely to move quickly and need to change direction without losing your balance. At the very least this is useful in a worst case scenario (dodging a moving car, fighting someone, etc.).</p>
<p>Agility ladder drills are a great way to perform foot drills and can be performed as part of the warm-up. I suggest doing your mobility work first, then go ahead and start on the ladder. Drills can be done for 5 to 10 minutes as a general warm-up before moving to your lifting schedule. Whatever drills you perform won’t be debilitating to your lifting, and if it is you are probably out of shape and need to do some conditioning work anyway. If you were going to lift maximally, then I would excuse you from agility work, but if you don’t compete in a strength sport I would have you do agility ladder drills as part of your warm-up every day. Especially for team sport athletes and soldiers.</p>
<p>I’m not going to get into the drills here — this is more of a post to teach the utility in doing agility ladder work — but some of the good ones include one foot in every hole (forward and lateral), one foot in every other hole (forward or lateral), single Ickey shuffle, double Ickey shuffle, and hop scotch. Running through each of those seven drills once will only take a few minutes. You can do two reps of each drill to get some more work in. The best drills are the single and double Ickey shuffles with the single version being the best. It’s excellent at teaching a person how to shift their weight laterally, how to maintain balance while changing directions, and improves foot speed. These drills can also be used as high intensity conditioning work, and you could even time your rest periods. If you aimed to use ladder drills as conditioning, then it would be okay to do them at the end of your training session (though your skill and agility development will be inhibited when you are fatigued).</p>
<p>Briefly, a point of emphasis in all agility work, including ladder drills, is to keep the feet under the hips. If the feet extend out in front, behind, or to the sides of the hips, then the base of support diminishes. Change of direction is dependent on having your feet under your center of mass to quickly apply force to stop or start, so keep the feet under the hips. To use the single Ickey shuffle as an example (which is what Chris and I do in the video above), must people will step too far lateral with their outside foot preventing a good base to push off that foot to move in the opposite direction — Chris does this a little bit. Keeping the feet under the hips is the key to agility and lateral speed. It’s also useful to burst into a ten yard sprint after completing the last segment of the ladder drill — it will teach the transition from agility or lateral movement to linear speed.</p>
<p>You can find cheap ladders on Amazon or sport stores, but I am partial to ladder segments that don’t slide up and down the straps. It can be quite annoying setting up a ladder with segments pushed around in a big bungle fuck. Most ladders are about 10 yards long, and that’s all you would need for training (we used a longer one in the above video).</p>
<p>If you want a new, interesting, method to warm-up and develop important athletic skills, then try out an agility ladder. When I played football I prided myself on my foot work and lateral speed, but that was probably due to the fact that I was linearly slow. Throw it in as a regular warm-up, or put it at the end of your workout for conditioning (doing agility work when tired is better than no agility work at all). Focus on a good, athletic body position (knees/hips bent, slight forward lean) with the feet under the hips. You’ll improve your coordination, perform conditioning that isn’t laborious, and ultimately improve your athletic ability with regular work.</p>

  <p>You may have seen the <a href="/blog/2013/01/pr-friday-18-jan-2013/" target="_blank">training video from last week</a> that included the original group of friends that helped create 70’s Big. I purposely didn’t mention how a better video exists, and it is <a href="http://mopeilitywod.com/2013/01/22/spend-a-lot-of-time-preparing-then-piss-it-all-away/" target="_blank">episode #3 of Brent’s Mopeility WOD</a>.</p>

<p>Some of you new readers are probably thoroughly confused, so let me explain. After I prematurely left graduate school, I was trying to find a situation where I could coach and learn. To make a long story short, I ended up at Rippetoe’s Wichita Falls Athletic Club for eighteen months. When I first arrived in January of 2009, I sat in my truck eating some food because Rip was not at the gym yet. Out walks an Asian kid carrying a gym bag with a frizzy fro sticking out six to eight inches off of his head. I sat there and thought, “Boy, he must be a real weightlifter.” I could not have been more fucking wrong.</p>
<p>This Asian was Brent Kim — my most peculiar and irritating best friend. Brent and I became friends, we added Chris, and we hung out and trained regularly. After painstaking effort — and by that, I mean two months of yelling arguments across the gym — I convinced Brent to do a linear progression. I also fixed the soft tissue issues in his proximal biceps, which allowed him to begin bench pressing again (breaking the scar tissue up was <a href="http://youtu.be/B_WcSTvZR1k" target="_blank">a lot like this</a>). I always say that I created a monster because Brent didn’t talk a lot until he did the linear progression. Whether it was his growing strength or his growing belligerence as a result of Chris and I picking on him, Brent was a rabid verbal sparring partner. It was like yesterday that I remember him telling Cliff, a mutual friend, to “get fucked”.</p>
<p>Brent is an interesting creature. He historically is afraid of talking to women, goes to bed really late, sleeps through important events, enjoys being insulted, and generally has a self deprecating outlook. He weighs under 160 pounds, yet he squats more than the majority of people reading this sentence (over 405 regularly and could do over 450 no big deal). He has pretty good mechanics and has learned the utility of mobility, but he is notorious for not being coachable. My favorite story is Glen Pendlay recalling Brent not really heeding any advice he had at all, ever. And Brent has a lot of respect for Pendlay!</p>
<p>Anyway, Brent has an interesting personality that comes out in his <a href="/shrugthug/" target="_blank">former training log</a> and now through his website <a href="http://mopeilitywod.com/" target="_blank">MopeilityWOD.com</a>.  The name stems from the effective MobilityWOD.com — Kelly Starrett’s engine of self mobility work — as well as the idea that at their core, <a href="http://mopeilitywod.com/what-the-fuck-is-this-shitshow/" target="_blank">every person truly is a mope</a>. Yet this acceptance should be celebrated and shared. The translation is that MopeilityWOD is a humorous, satirical world view infused with experiential truths. But you’ll never hear that from Brent.</p>
<p>Still not convinced to check it out? Then this will entice you: the first time I went to Australia in 2011, I had a nearly 50 year old man ask me if Brent actually acted the way he portrays himself. The answer was an irrevocable “yes”.</p>

  <p>**PR Friday: **Post your training PR’s and updates to comments. This gives you chance to communicate with like-minded readers, get encouragement or tips, and to be a part of our community.</p>
<p>The whole gang (AC, Brent, Chris, Mike, and Shawn) surprised me by showing up to Utah last Saturday. I thought I was just picking Chris up from the airport. He got in the truck and rolled the window down and was looking around.</p>
<p>“What the hell are you doing?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought I saw something.”</p>
<p>I start driving away and a guy runs in front of my vehicle and I have to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting him. He looks up with a clown-like look of fear and I recognize AC’s face. He sprints around the truck and opens my door. We hug and he starts getting in, and I continually ask him, “Where’s your bag?” He avoids answering the question and we start driving away and then Mike suddenly appears and opens the other back door and climbs in, hitting his head in the process. As I get out of my door to greet him, I see Shawn standing there clapping his hands and laughing like a king witnessing a good jester show.</p>
<p>We put all of their bags in the back — which is now completely full — and all of them squeeze in the back seat of my 3rd generation 4runner. To emphasize this point, I’m the smallest guy at 212 pounds, and of the three guys in the back seat, AC is the smallest at 220ish. Shawn is in the 230s and Mike is in the 270s. Chris is in the front seat coming in over 300 pounds. And we still needed to get Brent an hour later…</p>
<p>Long story short, we had some adventures. We got down to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/XcelFitnessUT" target="_blank">Xcel Fitness</a> in Salt Lake City for a training session. Thanks to owner Nate and my friends Randi and Ryan for accommodating us (Zoe helped too). This is the first time that all of us have gotten to train together in a couple of years, and the first time that Shawn trained with all of us. The following is a long video that has all of the lifts we actually filmed in chronological order. Chris and Mike are benching and pressing, AC is squatting, Brent is snatching, I’m power cleaning and push-pressing, and Shawn is deadlifting. There are funny tidbits sprinkled throughout, but it’s not a collage video like AC makes (it would take me a year to do that).</p>
