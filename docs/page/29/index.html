  <p>A few guys were recently asking questions about linear progressions in the comments. The discussion even got so specific guys were saying, “I like the Greyskull LP better than Starting Strength.” I find this distinction trivial, because 100% adherence to a program is not necessarily a good thing. The “cookie cutter approach” would state that a given program should be implemented with everyone or with a person in a specific group (i.e. a “novice”). Being a cookie cutter trainee and blindly following a program may not be optimal.</p>
<p>Perhaps internet readers are pressured into adhering to a specific program. Maybe it represents a devotion to the person who created the program. For example, Mark Rippetoe had to shout, “Do the fucking program,” because there were former bodybuilders, CrossFitters, or non-lifters who would try to add or change too much to the Starting Strength linear progression that it no longer was a simple strength progression with barbell movements. That “do the program” message was probably necessary around 2008 and 2009 because it was irritating to see people not making progress and asking why, or maybe even doing something that was no longer ‘Starting Strength’ and still calling it by that name.</p>
<p>My perception is that lack of adherence to a program doesn’t happen much anymore. Perhaps Rip influenced that by convincing people to just do Starting Strength like it’s listed, but CrossFit had to have helped too. CrossFit started as a, “Just do whatever workout shows up on this home page,” kind of thing. As many of us in the CF community realized that strength training needed to play a predominant role to increase performance or be better at CrossFit, various gyms started programming their own stuff. These gyms became popular and other people “followed their programming”. Let’s ignore the fact that a good program is tailored to an individual, so programming for an entire gym — or thousands of people — is not specific and inherently not optimal. The result is that hard training folks have gotten in the habit of “following” programs.</p>

<p>But programming is not intelligently putting exercises in a weekly schedule. Programs featured online __usually have a goal — aiming for strength, power, and conditioning — but without the context of the population it remains a schedule on a calendar. Sure, some guys can put some Olympic lifting, some strength training, and not-retarded looking conditioning workouts and get results — many things can work. But true programming is what works _optimally for the person doing it. _</p>
<p>I get comments, messages, and e-mails from CrossFitters asking, “What is the 70’s Big program? I can’t seem to find it.” There isn’t a 70’s Big program. I may have what I call a “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CC4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2F70sbig.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Ffiles%2FArticles%2FLascek_S%26CP_v2.0.pdf&ei=irC3UP3YKO3iyAHeiYC4DQ&usg=AFQjCNEd1VXWnWcrqPJ7JcOr6RIdptHrbw" target="_blank">strength and conditioning</a>” program or <a href="/books/the-texas-method-part-1/" target="_blank">The Texas Method</a> (and <a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">advanced</a>), but there is not a single program that people come to this site to do. Why? Because I <em>actually program</em>. I take into account the person’s current state of adaptation (which includes their body type, age, nutrition, recovery, injuries, current or past programs, etc.) along with what they need and want (i.e. goals). From there I devise a plan for someone to accomplish those goals.</p>
<p>There are existing programs that work well for a type of person. For example, linear progressions work with ‘novices’, Texas Method stuff works with ‘intermediates’, 5/3/1 works with ‘intermediates’ or ‘advanced lifters’ who want or need to avoid volume. Factor in the desire or need to do conditioning and it can complicate the application of these programs.</p>
<p>But this isn’t about my ability or difference in programming. It’s not about what coach or program is good or bad. It’s about the type of program you select and how you implement it. Instead of thinking of “doing a program”, think about “using a program”. **Programs are not indentured servitude where the user cannot tweak it for their goals; a program is an outline, a tool, to use to accomplish your goals. **</p>
<p>Let’s assume a person who decides to use the Starting Strength program. Unless you are in your late teens or early twenties, it’s likely that squatting 3 times a week in a linear progression (i.e. increasing the weight every session) will be too much work. Does that mean you have to “switch programs” to something like the Greyskull LP? No. Just stop fucking squatting 3 times a week. And if you want to deadlift on Wednesday and squat Monday and Friday, does that make it the Greyskull LP. No, it’s just arranged similarly.</p>
<p>Use programs as a template or foundation for structuring your training. Pay attention to the good and bad in a program, or more specifically what is helpful or not to you. For example, if you are weak on the bench and press and you are making progress from alternating them each training session, then you don’t need to drop them for weighted dips or push-press. But eventually just alternating the bench and press won’t be enough to continue progress. Another example is that the stock Starting Strength template would have you deadlifting every other session. If you’ve never lifted before and are weak, then this will be fine for 8 weeks or so. But eventually the frequency will need to drop to deadlifting once a week.</p>
<p>If I were structuring a generic novice’s training, their program would modify every 4 to 8 weeks to accommodate their progression. Since I’m not programming for all of you individually, you need to understand that you are allowed to make tweaks — it’s your program after all. Just don’t be stupid with your changes, and, as I stress in the Texas Method e-books, just make one small change at a time in a program instead of of revamping it entirely.</p>

I honestly feel that reading both Practical Programming and FIT creates an excellent foundation on how to program (and not just because I authored one and know the authors of the other).</p>
<p>It’s hard to wade through bullshit online, but try and take advice from people that not only have success with their programming, but regularly teach and challenge your knowledge of it. Develop a working understanding of physiology and how it adapts to training stress. Consider the stress/adaptation relationship when looking at your own programming. And for gods’ sakes, don’t feel like you’re trapped in a program.</p>

  <p>In “<a href="/blog/2012/11/shoulder-health-part-1/" target="_blank">Shoulder Health – Part 1</a>” I reviewed the musculature surrounding the shoulder and body posture. Posture is important because it dictates shoulder mechanics, specifically  <strong>internal and external rotation</strong>.</p>

    IR=internal rotation and ER=external rotation
  </p>
</div>
<p>Shoulder rotation is easy to decipher: if the anterior aspect (front) of the humerus (upper arm bone) rotates medial (towards the middle of the body), that is internal rotation. If the anterior aspect rotates laterally (away from the middle of the body), then that is external rotation. This holds true regardless if the elbow is flexed or extended, or if the shoulder is flexed, extended, abducted, etc. For example, put your arms overhead. Turn the front of your biceps (which sit on the anterior aspect of the humerus) towards your ears; this is internal rotation. Now turn them back and to the outside, and this is external rotation. Coincidentally this external shoulder rotation while in flexion is what the training community refers to as the “overhead position” — which is the position in which a person can bear a load safely (i.e. with good mechanics).</p>
<p>But it’s important to understand <em>why</em> external rotation facilitates a good overhead position and is the basis for shoulder stability in all shoulder movement. There are several reasons that are intimately related: shoulder positioning, muscular involvement, and force distribution (or mechanics).</p>
<p><strong>Shoulder Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, external rotation keeps “the shoulder” back and down whereas internal rotation moves it forward. “The shoulder” is actually the articulation of the humerus into the glenoid fossa; this junction is collectively called the “glenohumeral joint”. This bony articulation will be the focal point when we observe if the shoulder is “back” or “forward”. Keep in mind that the glenoid is a part of the scapula, or shoulder blade, and scapular movement (up, down, in, or out) can influence shoulder position.</p>

<p>In the above picture, the shoulder is in neutral position (relative to anatomical position), and the elbow is flexed. But you can see this same glenohumeral movement even in extension or flexion (i.e. if your arms are overhead for shoulder flexion, you can see the glenohumeral joint move if you completely internally rotate compared to where they were in complete external rotation).</p>

<p>This forward transition in internal rotation completely changes how the shoulder receives and distributes force (which we’ll talk about in the next two sections). But it also has an effect on thoracic spine positioning. The scapula is primarily held in place by the trapezius muscles and the rhomboids (see image right). So if internal rotation occurs, it pulls the scapula laterally to pull on those muscles that anchor the scapula. **The result is that if the shoulder is in severe internal rotation, the thoracic spine cannot achieve quality extension. **</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is easily seen in poor front squat or clean mechanics in CrossFit or Olympic Weightlifting. When the trainee flares their elbows out to the side (internally rotates the shoulders), their chest inevitably falls to round the upper back and usually also causes the lumbar spine to round (which may be directly caused by the thoracic spine or caused by the hip impingement from not shoving the knees out to externally rotate the hip). This severely inhibits good front squat mechanics and results in the trainee not training their musculature properly (it doesn’t work the upper back muscles, it shifts the center of mass forward, puts most of the weight and force application into the knees, and removes the gluteals and even the hamstring involvement, and undoubtedly contributes to “<a href="/blog/2012/05/the-crossfit-quads/" target="_blank">The CrossFit Quads</a>“). The cure for this is to cue the elbows “up and in”. “Up” means shoulder flexion and “in” means external rotation in the front rack. This cue should be distributed en masse to all CF facilities.</p>

    Hard to find a good example, but flared elbows means internal rotation means flexed thoracic spine means ineffective exercise.

Furthermore, having limited mobility in the shoulder is compensated by the thoracic spine. Let’s assume a person that has a poor overhead position. They cannot achieve full shoulder flexion (straight up and down) much less do it with external rotation. Their straight arm is five degrees forward of vertical (<a href="http://www.rainiercrossfit.com/.a/6a00d8341d2d0353ef0168e5546e52970c-400wi" target="_blank">example</a>). In order to put the bar “overhead”, they will compensate by hyper extending their thoracic/lumbar junction by 5 degrees (see image right). This is bad for several reasons: 1) places undue stress on the thoracic/lumbar junction or the lumbar/sacral junction; 2) it caters to existing shoulder or hip immobility and makes it worse; 3) it does not allow the trunk muscles to properly stabilize or develop properly which 4) results in a lack of progress and strength development in the press and 5) probably leads to some sort of injury or irritation, whether it be in the shoulders or cervical/thoracic/lumbar spine.</p>
<p>Now you should have a good understanding that internal rotation and/or lack of shoulder mobility can influence the positioning of the glenohumeral joint, but also the spine when lifting.</p>
<p><strong>Muscular Involvement</strong></p>
<p>Look at the image of the posterior shoulder anatomy again. Review the video from <a href="/blog/2012/11/shoulder-health-part-1/" target="_blank">part one</a>. We already know that the shoulder is the articulation of the humerus with the scapula. We know that rotation of the shoulder can alter the positioning of this joint. and we also know that since the scapula sits on the back of the rib cage, most of the musculature holding it in place is on the posterior side. There are some muscles that attach on the anterior aspect of the shoulder, but most of the important muscles are posterior. Also keep in mind that there is not a lot of structural stability in this joint — the muscles that attach around the glenoid and the head of the humerus hold everything in place. When you make a fist, your have some tissue surrounding a lot of bones. Your shoulder is pretty much two bones touching with a lot of muscles wrapped around it.</p>
<p>I point the anatomy out, because <em>how</em> these muscles are used matters. Previously mentioned muscles like the traps or rhomboids will effect scapular positioning, but the health of the shoulder joint lies with what people call “the rotator cuff” muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Other muscles like the teres major and lattisimus dorso play vital roles in shoulder mechanics.</p>
<p>The point isn’t to learn all of these muscles, but to the general role that shoulder musculature plays, especially regarding lifting. Some muscles externally rotate while others internally rotate. We already know that external shoulder rotation is efficient and desirable, but the muscle action supports this.</p>
<p>Without good coaching, a trainee will perform a press, bench press, or push-up however they can. They’ll utilize existing musculature to try and get the job done. But internally rotating the shoulders leaves out a lot of musculature, and thus stability in the shoulder. By externally rotating, all of the muscles that externally rotate will contract and all of the muscles that internally rotate will lengthen <em>with tension</em>. This last part is important, because in a well excecuted bench press the internal rotators will be taut and help stabilize the joint. In the same way that the hamstrings lengthen with tension during a squat, the internal rotators will be stretched, yet apply lots of tension to play their role in holding the shoulder in place.</p>
<p>On top of this added stability, the proper external rotation in this bench press also allows the distribution of force into other muscles (like the pecs and triceps) without exposing an area or structure to undue injurious stress. In other words, by using external rotation in pressing and pulling movements, more musculature is being used properly, which helps a trainee get stronger. This is also why people who internally rotate (and flare their elbows) will eventually experience pain or injuries. For example, conventional powerlifting lore says that pressing overhead is bad for the shoulders — and they are right! If you press overhead with crappy mechanics, you should expect to destroy your shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>Force Distribution</strong></p>
<p>I use the term “force distribution” to refer to what muscles are being utilized in a given movement. By lifting with quality shoulder positioning and mechanics, the muscles around the shoulder work in symphony to apply force. Proper technique yields comprehensive muscular action and development. I use the phrase “even force distribution” to mean that one muscle or muscle grouping is not solely relied on to complete a movement, and instead it is distributed evenly across all of the muscles that are _supposed _to be used.</p>
<p>For example, above I critiqued the poor CrossFit girl’s front squat technique (she needs lifting shoes too). By flaring her elbows on her front rack she drops her chest to a) round her upper back and b) drop the bar forward on her shoulders. When the bar shifts forward, it moves her overall center of mass forward, and then her knees and quads receive the brunt of the responsibility to stand up with the weight. In a quality clean or front squat, the load will stay centered to allow all of the muscles of the thighs and hips to apply force. In this case all of the gluteals, the hamstrings, and her lateral quadriceps are not contributing to the movement. Whether she’s doing the front squat for strength or conditioning, her coach is letting her not train her musculature as efficiently as she could. A crime, really.</p>
<p>Back to shoulder anatomy. If internal rotation occurs on pressing movements, then force is unevenly distributed. Specifically, the acromioclavicular joint (where the tip of the shoulder meets the clavicle) receives a lot of stress. This is also the same region as the proximal biceps tendon and the insertion of the supraspinatus. This means that these two tendons (biceps and supraspinatus) are often irritated, strained, and later frayed or torn when bad mechanics are used chronically.</p>
<p>In order to have even distribution across the shoulder muscles we must have good shoulder positioning, and this is done by using proper external rotation with respect to the exercise being performed. Good position allows for the proper muscles to act not only in the way they evolved to act, but in symphony with each other (this is an important point that is the reason that compound, multi-joint exercises are optimal for strength training and rehab). Since the positioning and musculature are correct, the force application is evenly distributed so that the muscles do their job, keep the joint safe, and get stronger.</p>
<p>The problem is that all of this is either inhibited or not possible with crappy shoulder mobility. And that is the topic in Part 3.</p>

  <p>I haven’t posted anything on <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">protein</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/09/water-and-protein/" target="_blank">water</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/08/public-service-announcement-toe-angle/" target="_blank">mobility</a>, or <a href="/blog/2012/02/garbage-in-garbage-out/" target="_blank">nutrition</a> in a while and I feel that doing so makes you consider your habits. Have the guys been eating one gram of protein per pound of body weight plus fifty (e.g. a 200 pound male would hit a minimum of 250g of protein)? Have the gals been aiming for almost 1g per pound of body weight? Are you drinking half your body weight in ounces of water (e.g. a 200 pound male would drink 100 oz of water)? Are you doing daily mobility to improve your movement limitations or painful areas? Are you returning to a clean diet after last week’s eating extravaganza?</p>
<p>These are the little things that make or break your training. Any child can go into the weight room and attack the barbell, but it takes a professional to pay attention to details outside of the gym. If you’re encountering recovery problems — and aren’t using stupid amounts of volume, intensity, or frequency — then look to how well you’re adhering to the above “outside of the gym” aspects of training. If you’ve read this site for a while, you should  be thinking “duh”, but at the same time you may realize you haven’t been hitting your daily protein requirements.</p>
<p>Remember that recovery is not a glass of water that you can quickly fill or empty; it’s a continuum. Eating 300+ grams of protein, doing an entire hour of mobility, or over hydrating in one day might be impressive, but it amounts to precisely dick if you don’t do it regularly. You should be consistent enough so that you don’t require a cram session. It’s the same thing as lifting: if you haven’t lifted in a week, you can’t make up for lost time by squatting 20 sets of 5 in your next workout. The concept makes sense in the gym, so act the same outside of it.</p>
<p>If you’re sitting there wondering why you haven’t squatted 405 or pressed your body weight, it might be because you don’t take your training seriously…which is fine if you don’t want to hit your goals. Spending 5 to 10 hours of your week toiling with the iron is more than a fucking hobby; quit dicking around and <a href="http://youtu.be/SCFfCPX6Nr8" target="_blank">get serious</a>.  Do you want to be an imposing physical specimen who lets children do chin-ups off of your biceps after pressing a car? Then realize that these “little things” <em>are</em> training and get to work.</p>

  <p>Today’s post compiles the results of the annual <a href="/blog/2012/11/thanksgiving-weight-challenge-2012/" target="_blank">2012 Thanksgiving Weight Gain Challenge</a>. Each video was pretty funny and worth watching. I’ve made a table of the winners in each category:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/2012/11/2012results.png"><img data-attachment-id="8110" data-permalink="/blog/2012/11/2012-thanksgiving-results/2012results/" data-orig-file="/2012/11/2012results.png" data-orig-size="609,284" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="2012results" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/11/2012results-200x93.png" data-large-file="/2012/11/2012results-450x209.png" class="aligncenter  wp-image-8110" title="2012results" src="/2012/11/2012results.png" alt="" width="487" height="227" srcset="/2012/11/2012results.png 609w, /2012/11/2012results-150x69.png 150w, /2012/11/2012results-200x93.png 200w, /2012/11/2012results-450x209.png 450w, /2012/11/2012results-500x233.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  Most of the contenders weighed about the same, so the &#8220;Percent of Body Weight&#8221; category did not vary much from the &#8220;Absolute Gain&#8221; category. The heaviest guys were Joe Bloom and Rob Brown (start weight of 225 and 236.6 respectively). Lightest guys were criedthefox (Brian) and Daren Welsh (176.5 and 184.6 respectively). Of the 11 contenders, there was a total weight gain of 86.5 pounds.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  Willey&#8217;s winning results are surprising because he started at 191 and gained 13 pounds, but his discomfort seemed sincere in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/440YoexaVd8" target="_blank">post weigh-in video</a>. One contender can&#8217;t win both categories, so Daren Welsh will win the other (he&#8217;s second in both).
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  As for &#8220;funniest video&#8221;, I have narrowed it down to a few. I want to point out that I thought all of the videos were amusing, so give &#8217;em a watch. We will choose the funniest video in this post&#8217;s comments out of the following x:
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  criedthefox clearly spent a lot of time on this year&#8217;s entry. He went from 176.5 to 184.5. Will he retain the title?<br /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/coQ0vBKINd4" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>
</p>
<p>Zach Paulus has really come out of no where this year. Literally. In this video he said he used to weigh 135 and weighed in at 188.2, so he’s been hard at work (his second weigh-in put him at 194.6). This video is a must-watch. Don’t make fun of him.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6DrVZLif2nw" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Alphantis did two quick vids, but I laughed really fucking hard at the end of this first video. He went from 187 to 193.5.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xiizHSy3Rbg" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>newgetelqueso participates in the challenge from the Middle East and questions a girl on manly qualities. He went from 75.6 to 78.6kg (his response to kilos is good).</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9ynozRVh9E" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Daren Welsh’s video is very good, and he sports a nice mustache (which undoubtedly helped him win), but he can’t win another award. He went from 184.6 to 194.6 for an even 10 pound gain.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9-mE4y-eQM" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The others with comments from memory:</p>
<p>Rob Brown’s girlfriend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vEXa8Mk79dI" target="_blank">brought a scale in her purse</a> to Cracker Barrell and at the end of the video Rob presses her (she squeals with delight). Rob went from 236.6 to 241 in about 45 minutes of eating. Unfortunately I didn’t include a category for most weight gained in shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>Joe Bloom went from 225 to 235 and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qYNZDpxA8gk" target="_blank">makes a porno joke with his wife</a>.</p>
<p>Mike Innola went from 188.8 to 195.8 and is quite clearly drunk in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/k1wbP3roQYg" target="_blank">second weigh-in</a>.</p>
<p>Broseph went from 192.8 to 201.6 and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oz9_QbDsNpo" target="_blank">caught a pump prior to going on camera</a>.</p>
<p>Austin went from 194.4 to 200.2 and is in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2wjKI31xUX4" target="_blank">middle of his third trimester</a>.</p>
<p>Well done to the contenders. We’ll see you in 2013.</p>

<p>I hope everyone is enjoying their holiday weekend. There’s no Q&amp;A today, but here’s what’s on this week’s agenda:</p>
<p>**PR Friday: **Post your training updates and PR’s to the comments.</p>
<p>**Thanksgiving Weight Gain Challenge: **Post your videos to the comments. Everyone else start rating them on a scale of 1 to 10.</p>
<p>**Movember Fundraising: **The fundraising effort hasn’t raised much money in the last week (we’re at $3,701 total). There are literally 36 team members who haven’t raised any money whatsoever. What the hell is that? C’mon people, ask around and raise a little money.</p>

The original holiday didn’t exactly work out like that, and the puritans didn’t dress like Gordons all the time, but it’s too boring to discuss. Instead, let’s talk about the <strong>Third Annual 70′s Big Thanksgiving Weight Gain Challenge</strong>.</p>
<p>Before we discuss the rules, I want to point out that anybody who is aiming to eat clean today is a boner-faced gremlin. If you’re the type of person that makes everyone switch restaurants because a spatula may have gluten on it, then you need to <del>go play in traffic</del> keep your trap shut before one of us puts our foot in it. Unless you have celiac…in which case you shouldn’t eat bad stuff because nobody wants you splatter pooping all over their bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Weigh-ins must be recorded on video with a valid time source. Since you may not have a scale to use at a relative’s house, there is no time restriction on when the weigh-in needs to occur.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. The same scale must be used in both weigh-ins with the same attire or clothing. Don’t get naked; we don’t want to see your hairy dong.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Be concise, but try to be funny. Don’t make us sit through 3 minutes of labored breathing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload videos to YouTube with a title of “70′s Big Thanksgiving – (Name)” with (Name) being your name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link the video to the PR Friday comments. Entries close when Sunday ends.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure to comply with any of these rules will result in disqualification from the contest and awarding of the Expert Shoveller’s Badge. To get an idea of what to do, <a href="/blog/2011/11/thanksgiving-results/" target="_blank">review last year’s entries</a>. Categories are “Absolute Weight Gained” and “Percentage of Body Weight Gained”. There may be a “Funniest Video Award” if someone is actually funny (this means you criedthefox).</p>
<p>_Edit: This weight gain challenge is supposed to be accomplished by eating a Thanksgiving meal. _</p>
<p>**70’s Big wishes you and yours a wonderful Thanksgiving. **</p>

  <p>Tomorrow will be the 70’s Big Thanksgiving Weight Gain Challenge. To clarify, submissions will consist of pre/post weigh-ins (on film) and extra points will be awarded to funny stuff. Be sure to check tomorrow’s post before filming (it’ll post at midnight).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the friends at 70’s Big are all training well. Chris and Mike are getting ready for another strongman competition and AC is pressing his wang off. The fourth video are outtakes from USAPL Nationals and was <del>fair at best</del> amusing.</p>
<p>AC presses 270×2:</p>

  <p>Ladies, I’m here for you.</p>
<p>I’m here to lift you up, overhead in a pressing movement, to protect you from harm. And that harm comes from a formidable opponent. One that will belligerently scoff and argue with you until the end of time. That opponent is yourself.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain! Your sense of womanly propriety is going to kill your squat! No, I don’t mean putting a strap on your <a href="/blog/2012/04/boobs/" target="_blank">boobs</a> (link is unbelievably safe for work) or wearing makeup — I mean crossing your legs and wearing high heels!</p>
<p><a href="/2012/11/cross-legs.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8088" data-permalink="/blog/2012/11/the-danger-of-being-a-woman/cross-legs/" data-orig-file="/2012/11/cross-legs.jpg" data-orig-size="660,371" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="cross legs" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/11/cross-legs-200x112.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/11/cross-legs-450x252.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8088" title="cross legs" src="/2012/11/cross-legs-450x252.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="252" srcset="/2012/11/cross-legs-450x252.jpg 450w, /2012/11/cross-legs-150x84.jpg 150w, /2012/11/cross-legs-200x112.jpg 200w, /2012/11/cross-legs-500x281.jpg 500w, /2012/11/cross-legs.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>I once coached a girl who could barely squat or bend down without her knees touching each other. She had learned to keep her legs together because it’s the “womanly thing to do” when wearing a skirt or dress. After all, a womanly woman doesn’t want to have a Britney Spears-like-hooha incident. The unfortunate result is that her muscles adapted to this chronic application of poor mechanics to the point of having non-existant external hip rotators, shortened groin muscles, a lack of hamstring musculature, and a lack of quad development. I’ve seen women who literally push their knees together as a brace for standing up in the same way that your grandparents use a cane.</p>
<p>These examples represent the extreme, but chronically sitting cross-legged or with the legs together will probably create some muscular limitations. For example, one of the regular female 70’s Big readers once lamented how her lack of mobility in her internal hip rotators (the groin area) was inhibiting her split position in the jerk; I could see this being caused by “womanly sitting”. Merely standing up with the knees close together can also contribute to shortened internal rotators. The motion typically involves the knees pushed in and forward while the woman cantilevers her torso to push herself into a standing position with her knees; this completely removes the hamstrings and hips from the standing up motion. As a result, new clients or trainees may have a bit of trouble with exercises like squatting and will need to open their hips before training.</p>
<p>Combine dress-wearing etiquette with the likelihood of wearing high heels, and we have a situation that would make Kelly Starrett’s head explode. The raised heel severely alters the mechanics of the entire lower body; the ankle is placed in severe plantar flexion to change the force application on the foot, and force easily reverberates up into the knees, hip, and back. Woman <em>know</em> this is occurring because high heels are uncomfortable, yet they wear them anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the discomfort of wearing high-heel shoes were not enough, try this on for size: The point of a spike heel worn by the average-sized woman is subjected to nearly 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch with every step she takes. The force is shot into the heel and reverberates up the entire body. When air travel was in its infancy, women wearing high heels were actually prohibited from boarding airplanes because the heels of their shoes might pierce the thin metal floors.</p>
<p>—<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0965853454/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0965853454&linkCode=as2&tag=70sbi-20" target="_blank">Trail Guide to the Body, 3rd Ed. </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Yikes. Not only do high heels put a lot of force on structures that weren’t adapted to handle the stress in that manner, but they also shorten the calves — an area that is almost always in need of “opening” for improved mechanics in lifting and athletics. Whether you’re planning on squatting, running/sprinting, snatching, cleaning, or jerking, making the calves tight will only be counter-productive.</p>
<p>What’s a girl to do?</p>

Absolutely not! What I’m actually saying is this: **TAKE YO SHOES OFF AND SPREAD YO LEGS — WHOOOOOOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEE! **</p>
<p>Man, I really wanted to end the post right there. But I need to clarify my advice so that all of you don’t take it literally and emulate Paula Broadwell. ZING!</p>
<p>Okay…c’mon guys…focus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No, I’m not saying that you shouldn’t wear dresses or heels. But, when you do wear skirts or heels, know that you’ll have some extra mobility work to do on the structures you shorten. You can also help yourself by avoiding this attire on days when you are plan to squat or Olympic lift, especially if you’re going heavy. While wearing a dress isn’t a big deal — especially if you’re diligent with mobility work — it’d be a good idea to limit the frequency of wearing heels in a week. Those gals who change from tennis shoes to heels as they arrive at the office have already figured that heels are inherently bad. You could even save the heels for a special occasion, like those times when you want to seduce a four star general.</p>
<p>Crossing legs and wearing heels won’t destroy your training, but doing so regularly without extra mobility attention will result in chronically tight structures. The result could be injurious, but it will most likely result in inefficient lifting technique. Figure out what’s more important: training or looking good at work. And if it’s the latter, then get working on that mobility like you’re working on a rousing biography.</p>

  <p>**PR Friday: **Post PR’s and training updates to comments. Mingle. Have a good time.</p>
<p>**Continuing Weekly Challenge: Movember Fundraising: **</p>
<p>The 70’s Big Movember Network (including other countries) has raised $3,263 at the time of this writing. That’s purdy good, but we’re right after the halfway point in the month, and the goal this year was to raise $8,000. The approach this year was to ask as many of you to join the team as possible, and get as many donations as possible. It seems obvious, but there are about 30 members on the team who haven’t raised any money at all. Just ask your family and friends to donate $1 — literally one doll hair. If you accumulate $10 total, that will be neat. Especially if you other guys reading this join the team and raise your own $10. This cancer stuff can effect all of us; an old friend recently caught some early stages of cancer. Raising this money isn’t self serving; it’ll help people like him. Thank you for your time or effort in this fundraising.</p>
<p>**Weekly Recap: **Sunday was <a href="/blog/2012/11/veterans-day-2012/" target="_blank">Veteran’s Day</a>, and thank you to anyone generous enough to donate two bucks to two different veteran charities; showing vets that you are willing to take action for them means more than your words. On Monday Jacob Cloud posted about <a href="/blog/2012/11/hyde-park-gym-ladies-at-the-longhorn-open/" target="_blank">the women who competed at the Longhorn Open</a>. Tuesday we talked about two good posts from <a href="/blog/2012/11/pendlays-weightlifting-programming-tips/" target="_blank">Glenn Pendlay about weightlifting programming</a>. Wednesday we dug into some of the <a href="/blog/2012/11/koklyaev-and-russian-weightlifting/" target="_blank">reasoning why Misha Koklyaev was unable to represent Russia in the Olympics for weightlifting</a>.</p>

<p>Justin, I thought this might make an odd, yet informative question/post. It seems that I’ve run into a problem that every man runs into: the roids…not the steroids, but the hemorrhoids. I have them and they’re really fucking up my workout schedule man. I really don’t know what to do about them, so I guess I’m going to go see Dr. Jelly Fingers in a couple of days to see what he says because this shit is unbearable (pardon the pun).</p>
<p>So these are my questions:</p>
<p>Does squatting and heavy lifting cause hemorrhoids?  That’s what everyone keeps telling me and I deny it, but I really can’t attribute it to anything else. How should I go about my training until it gets healed? Squatting is pretty much out of the question when it gets irritated. Thanks for reading this man. I know it’s kind of a funny topic or  whatever, but it’s serious man. I can’t, and won’t stop strength training, which is what I’m 90% sure the doctor will tell me to do. So what is your knowledge and experience on what to do in this situation?</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear Connor,</strong></p>
<p>Interesting yet probably relevant topic, indeed. Let me preface this with the fact that my hemorrhoids knowledge is limited; I haven’t had them <del>more than half my life</del> nor have I coached anyone that has had them. I did find <a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/health-medicine/hemorrhoids-and-athlete-how-keep-training" target="_blank">this article</a> and will point out a few things along with adding some other information.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids are an enlarged vein in the anus, and they can distend outside of the body. Dealing with existing hemorrhoids includes:</p>
<p>– avoiding putting pressure into the lower abdomen when lifting (thereby pushing it in the bully or up into the closed throat)</p>
<p>– stay hydrated, eat healthy fats to soften the stool (to avoid irritating the hemorrhoids)</p>
<p>– don’t strain when pooping</p>
<p>– take a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitz_bath" target="_blank">sitz bath</a></p>
<p>– don’t take over the counter anti-inflammatories</p>
<p>The article above points out that it’s still possible to train with hemorrhoids, but you obviously want to take care to not make them worse. In order to prevent hemorrhoids, I think the best thing you can do is progress into heavy lifting when you aren’t adapted to it. Irritating the blood vessels around the anus is the result of two possible things: a) putting excessive pressure in that region when lifting or b) increasing general blood pressure when you’re not adapted to it. To avoid putting pressure towards the B-hole, take a big breath, and then try to expel it through your throat and mouth, but close the epiglottis so that no air can move through your throat. When you do this, you’ll probably feel your abdominal muscles contract and pressure in your upper body increase. If you’re not used to this, be careful using it when you are actually lifting; it’s a bit different than merely taking a big breath and holding it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the adaptation to pressure increases will probably dictate forming or irritating hemorrhoids. The guy in the article above can squat and deadlift over 700 pounds without symptoms, but you may need to work to adapt to a work load near or at your max. Oh, and obviously don’t put large pressure stresses on them when they are flaring up.</p>

<p>QUESTION: During weighted chins I’m noticing that my right shoulder/chest touches the bar considerably earlier than my left side. I’m only doing barbell excercises – no dumbbell or other one-sided lifting work – and always check that I’m in the middle of the bar. What does it mean and how do I counter this problem? Is it muscle</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>imbalance or is my posture screwed up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear patrick87,</strong></p>
<p>I can’t say for certain what the issue is without seeing it. The likely culprits are a lack of mobility or poor posture. You could also have some strength or musculature imbalances. I’d try and figure out which of these you think it is and deal with it appropriately. In the mean time, try to touch both shoulders at the same time (you may have to cue the opposite side to lead the way).</p>

    First rugby game ever last night. We won, absolutely dominating what has long been considered the best team in the league. And the coach declared me “man of the match.” I haven’t felt so proud in a long time.

    QUESTION: I have heard that NSAIDs can cause damage to the intestinal lining and tax the liver, but let’s be real now, after the beating I took last night, fish oil and mobbing aren’t going to cut it for getting me back into playing condition within a week, and definitely not enough to get me ready to squat on Monday. I know from past experience that NSAIDs have helped me get rid of problems in two days that fish oil and mobbing hadn’t solved in weeks. Is there anything wrong with taking ibuprofen for a day or two for a quick fix? If not, what are my options for getting myself healed quickly?<br /> Note: I eat (mostly) paleo (I include dairy and potatoes fairly regularly) and take tons of fish oil and vitamins, and drink lots of water. The areas that are most hurt right now are my right shoulder and both of my quads. Last time I had tissue bruised this badly it took two weeks to feel better. I don’t have that kind of time anymore. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

    <strong>Dear newgetelqueso,</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    A few things. First, let&#8217;s look at <a href="/blog/2012/11/qa-50/comment-page-1/#comment-30754" target="_blank">pseudodan&#8217;s response</a> to you last week. He alluded to the fact that strength training &#8220;wasn&#8217;t paleo&#8221; and such. This is referring to the &#8220;paleo lifestyle&#8221; bullshit that people talk about (which pseudodan is against; I just wanted to rant about this). Paleo is just the nutrition thing, because anybody that is not brushing their teeth or squatting to shit (at home) is an idiot. Trying to avoid the &#8220;Neolithic lifestyle&#8221; is not only stupid as shit, but it&#8217;s hypocritical unless they are out in the woods and they&#8217;d still be using their neolithic knowledge they picked up before trying to devolve.
  </p>
  <p>
    All that being said, potatoes are fine when following Paleo nutrition (I&#8217;ll talk more about stuff like this soon). pseudodan mentioned you should be weary of increasing fish oil, and I agree if you&#8217;re already taking 4 or 5 grams of it. Otherwise you could increase it to that. I agree with pseudodan that acute intakes of ibuprofen and such is okay. But, now that you&#8217;re a real athlete who is getting his body smashed, you need to start looking into advanced recovery techniques, particularly methods to reduce swelling as fast as possible like compression, elevation, ice (&#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/08/should-you-use-ice/" target="_blank">Should you use ice</a>?&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/08/how-should-we-ice-then/" target="_blank">How should we ice, then?</a>&#8220;), contrast baths (they pulse the lymphatics system as a whole), and some basic movement with compression (depending on the advancement of the injury).

    I have a question maybe for next weeks Q&amp;A maybe its an easy reply. I have been rehabbing from back surgery with The diesel crew back rehab protocol, easy way to sum it up is lots of bird dog, planks, bridges, dumbell RDLs, band good mornings, anti latteral flexion and rotation work, along with hip and thorasic mobility.I have been doing good working out 7 days a week for a few weeks, 5 days a week for a few weeksand now I’m nearing the last few weeks of the program at 3 days a week before going back to regular barbell training 3 days a week. I’m excited to have come this farbut I’m still dealing with a good amount of back soreness. I understand that what I am doing is going to cause soreness since I am trying to over come the last year of my back being a mess and doing nothing physical for it, but I am wondering if there is any strategy to improving tissue quality in my low back to help speed this up. I have had sucess in other funky areas using foam rollers, soft balls, lacrosse ballsand other tricks but I’m unsure of safe ways to do the same in the low back. I don’t have 1 spot injury pain, just a general soreness and tightness that you would get from working out. I am overweight and have already gotten my diet and supplements under control, I’m sure that will help greatly as time goes on. I also take no pain medications. Any recovery advice for this area would be greatly appreciated.
  &lt;/p&gt;

If it doesn&amp;#8217;t accomplish anything for a few weeks, then you will want to reconsider the approach. In general, I recommend that you stay active &amp;#8212; especially because you say you&amp;#8217;re overweight. If you aren&amp;#8217;t walking daily, then I recommend that. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497063/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0615497063&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=70sbi-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FIT&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about speed walking for 15 minutes several times a week, and this sounds like a good idea for you in addition to whatever rehab or lifting you may be doing (walking is also good rehab for the back).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of rotational exercises and lateral spine stuff, and it sounds like that is present in your routine. It may be a bit early to lift, so try to incorporate some basic calisthenics if you can (squatting, lunging, push-ups, pull-ups, etc.). When you do start lifting, start with very light weight (the bar) and keep your normal rehab stuff in. Standard rehab advice is: do a little, see how it responds, then do just slightly more next time if everything is fine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
