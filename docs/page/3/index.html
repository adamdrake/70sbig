  <p>Here’s a little story. Jean Claude Van Damme walks into a bar. His loose fitting tank top sits on top his oiled, shorn body, glistening under the dim lights. His pants are baggy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD1Usk0DYc0" target="_blank"><em>always </em>baggy</a>. His $3,000 loafers side step a spilled drink on the floor and he surveys the bar.</p>
<p>This bar is like most bars: a mash up of disgusting human behavior and a few shiny gems strewn about. One gem catches Jean’s eye, a beautiful creature sitting at the bar. With hair like a fresh brewed espresso and fingers as crafty as a bonobo, this beauty lazily reclines on a barstool. One arm dangles over the back of the stool, the other consumes a juicy, fleshy treat.</p>
<p>“You know…I could eat a peach for hours…” says Nic Cage, the beautiful creature. A powerful feelings sweeps over Jean’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2WKSjgJsCE" target="_blank">loins</a> as he knows his night — Nay! His life! — cannot be complete without speaking to, without learning the secrets of Nic Cage’s heart.</p>
<p>Jean saunters up, thumbs hooked in his waist band, squeezing a few beads of sweat out onto his shoulders. He catches Cage’s attention and slowly rumbles, “Hello my sweet, may I buy you a dreenk?”</p>
<p>Cage, is startled, “Sorry boss, but there’s only two men I trust. One of them’s me. The other’s not you.”</p>
<p>Jean’s face slips into desperation. He can no longer hold onto his beaded sweat and it begins to embarrassingly soak through his tank top. Suddenly, a paw thuds on Jean’s shoulder. Despite the grease and sweat, the paw remains motionless after the sound of the clap echoes through the bar. All music and conversation has stopped. All eyes are on the man with the paw.</p>
<p>It’s literally a paw. There’s a guy holding a bear paw, and he slapped it onto Jean’s shoulder. It’s the creepy <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ahuvxRitU74/S-Ir9NnqQZI/AAAAAAAAQHc/9QiHJGzxcMM/s1600/3193261418_16f91558ae.jpg" target="_blank">“Get off my train,” guy</a> from the movie <em>Ghost</em>. He stares into Jean’s eyes and then asks, “Who do you think yer talkin’ to?” his words spilling out like gravel.</p>
<p>Jean’s biceps flex hard and he performs a flurry of unnecessary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vw_-uylxNE" target="_blank">splits </a>and the guy from _Ghost _falls through a wooden table, pieces of wood exploding throughout the room. A swarm of bar patrons rush to engage Jean, who somehow has already removed his shirt and is adamantly flexing, increasing his systolic blood pressure well over 170. Johnny Cage steps from behind a row of trees and Steven Segal somersaults into the room. Boba Fett crashes through the roof while Danny DeVito in his Penguin attire from <em>Batman Returns</em> stumbles in, opening and closing his umbrella menacingly. All of these villains begin beating Jean to the ground. As they pummel him, Jean looks through the mass of punches and kicks to see Nic Cage sitting on his bar stool laughing…laughing.</p>

<hr>
<p>Allow me to explain.</p>
<p>You are Jean Claude Van Damme. Your attraction to Nic Cage is your “bright idea”. Everything that happens after is a reflection of your bad decisions. Think of the bar in the story as your “system”.</p>
<p>I use the term “system” to summarize all of the crap going in the human body. In physiology, we teach all the systems separately to understand the whole. Systems of the body include the integumentary (skin), skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, circulatory, lymphatic and immune, respiratory, urinary, digestive, and reproductive. It’s easy to forget how these are interrelated, whether from a training perspective or in modern medicine.</p>
<p>In our case, it’s important to pay attention to all the stuff that effects our system. This awareness can help make programmatic adjustments to prevent illness, injury, or poor performance because the state of the system is an indicator of recovery capability. If the system is “depressed”, or something causes a debilitating effect on it, then all functions of the system are hampered.</p>
<p>Let’s go through two case studies.</p>
<p>The first is a person with a lot of emotional stress due to relationship issues for a month. Significant emotional stress itself can lowers the can lower the capability of the system, but it’s often associated with altered dietary and sleep habits. The person is tired, not getting enough calories, full of inflammatory stress hormones, and then on top of all of that, they are trying to maintain their normal training load.</p>
<p>The person in this example now has a depressed system and their physiology is not functioning at a normal level. Now imagine that they go out for a night of drinking and stay up late — events that depress the system. Their metabolism is working to oxidize the alcohol and they are dehydrated, further harming the system. A day or so later, they get sick.</p>
<p>It’s not that they were hit with a super bug infection that knocks them on their ass. It’s that their system had the shit kicked out of them by several different things and a minor bacteria or virus took advantage of the immune system being compromised. A good training program is a stress on the system. But so is emotional stress, a lack of sleep, binge drinking, and a lack of calories. All of the factors together create a storm that the body can’t recover from. Eventually there will be a <a href="/blog/2011/02/the-final-stroke/" target="_blank">fail point</a>.</p>
<p>For the second case study, we’ll travel to  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/3anid2/help_with_crazy_deadlift_strength_drop/" target="_blank">this Reddit post </a>in /weightroom. The TL;DR is that a young fella’s deadlift strength has significantly decreased. He made a list of potential contributing factors he thought may be contributing. My answer is in the comments (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/70sbig" target="_blank">/u/70sbig</a>), but I wasn’t surprised to hear that he took a few weeks off, started a manual labor job, was training 7x/wk, decreased his deadlift frequency, and had a decrease in caloric intake.</p>
<p>Any one of those things would provide a change on his system that would likely have a debilitating effect. Seeing them all sitting before you in succession makes it very obvious to see why his strength suffers. But if you’re living your life and not looking at all of the variables that can influence training, it’s easy to miss them until the fail point occurs. The fail point is when you get injured, miss a lift, or finally realize you’re sick.</p>
<p>You easily can find yourself in a situation. You’re in a metaphorical bar (a depressed system) attracted to a beautiful creature (training). You won’t see the danger you’re in until you’re getting a solid beat down from Segal, Boba, and bad guys that know Whoopi Goldberg (the things walloping your system). Look, this metaphor is wildly out of control. The lesson is this: you may not be able to avoid problematic circumstances, but you can at least identify them and make better decisions to accommodate them. The last thing you want is to helplessly see the face of Nic Cage laughing at you uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>I hate it. The yellowy built up callus at the base of the fingers can be so thick, it looks like dinosaur DNA could be extracted from the bugs encased within. Lifters and CrossFitters seem to wear calluses as a badge at the expense of scratching their girlfriend’s soft skin, or heavens to Betsy, their <em>own</em> nether region. There’s more detriment than a scratched bosom; calluses are unnecessary unsightly and can rip off. Missing training for a lack of simple hand care is immature.</p>
<p>It’s possible to keep callus and dry skin off your hands. It’s possible to still develop thicker skin that is resistance to barbell knurling stress, but still supple enough to give a loving massage. A lifter’s hands should be like leather: tough and protecting for lifting, but soft and supple at home for activities. Chalk Talk #22 shows you how:</p>

  <p>Good gyms are hard to come by. Globo gyms should only be used out of necessity given their lack of equipment and attitude. The only reliable option nowadays is a CrossFit gym, but they may require attending one of their classes or have limited schedules.</p>
<p>Luckily, I found <a href="http://www.crossfitgoodvibes.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Good Vibes</a> in Augusta, GA. The owner, Brandon Cunningham, is a nine time Firefighter Combat Challenge World Champion. He has a certified 1:17 500m row on the Concept 2 rower, and is a two time Pan American Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Champion. Above all that, he’s a great guy and let us train however we wanted to in his gym.</p>

<p>CrossFit Good Vibes AKA 3B Fitness AKA Gracie Elite Augusta AKA Iron Eagle Barbell Club is a wide open space. On one end, there are platforms worked into the rubber flooring for Olympic weightlifting. There’s a large pull-up rig in the center along with plenty of open floor space. There’s also a 50+ meter turf track for stuff like agility work, pushing the sled, or other shenanigans. The opposite side of the building from the platforms has an open area for CrossFit classes as well as a large matted area for BJJ.</p>
<p>The weightlifting area is equipped with a variety of Pendlay bars and bumpers, and this is where I spent most of my time. There’s a core group of people that lift together. On any given night there will be a nurse, an assistant principal, a former Special Forces soldier, a former NFL receiver, a fire fighter, a geared powerlifter (seen below), and a college student all training together and cheering each other on. For the first time in a long time, I felt at home in a gym.</p>

<p>I ended up hitting some numbers I haven’t hit in a long time. I pressed 205 lbs for 5, snatched 125kg, and clean and jerked 150kg while doing a variety of conditioning workouts in the Augusta summer heat.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank the trainees and coaches (Brandon, Steve, Joe, Tony, etc.) at CrossFit Good Vibes for their hospitality. If you’re near the Georgia and South Carolina border and need a place to train, I suggest giving them a call. They’ll welcome you into their training den and will undoubtedly encourage you to push yourself.</p>

  I typically use the <a href="http://wp.me/pEKxw-2pq" target="_blank">same post</a> every Memorial Day to remind American readers of their freedoms. Every year, families and friends gather to grill meat and wave flags, but getting a day off from work and drinking a beer doesn&#8217;t really do justice to those that have lost their lives in service of the United States of America.

  I won&#8217;t spin tales of heroes, sacrifice, and death. I won&#8217;t ask you to thank anyone or give a donation. All I ask is that you <em>live honorably. </em>Most service members believe this country is worth enduring a lot of shitty situations. There&#8217;s an idea that despite our flaws, America is an amazing place to live full of righteous people who work hard, have personal responsibility, and always try to improve.
</p>
<p style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24.375px;">
  Do not let them down; live honorably. Convince the families of the fallen that their loss was worth it. Convince the service members who still toil that their effort is worth it. Take responsibility of your life and actions, respect others, and never, ever stop trying to succeed. Teach others how to do the same.
</p>
<p style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24.375px;">
  The only true memorial is to live this way, to live honorably. Everything else is an obligatory charade. This is not a day if celebration, but of remembrance. Lest we forget.

  <p>Times are a changin’.</p>
<p>Folks in times like the Great War did things because they had to. Nowadays most of us privileged, first-world folk get to do things because we want to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.</p>
<p>–John Adams, letter to Abigail, 12 May 1780</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Little did Mr. Adams know, people would hide themselves behind glowing screens, living vicariously through the exaggerated deeds of others. Past efforts in politics, war, and commerce provide the freedom to do…or don’t.</p>
<p>But that’s what sets us apart. Every time you step under a bar, you’re doing. Instead of talking or watching, you execute. Every time you look at the distance you’ll sprint or the thing you’ll lift with an honest, healthy fear, you are <em>doing</em>. When you look down at your hands and see grit, callus, and blood, it’s the product of work. The product of life.</p>
<p>You train for a purpose, do you not? Training is nearly synonymous with suffering, because true training is difficult. At times, it’s a giant pain in the ass. The moment is hard when the doubt or fear sets in. The planning is hard when you pass on adult beverages or place head to pillow one hour earlier. But there is purpose to this suffering. Not only for the end result, but the moment of clarity when you burst through the fear or adversity. It’s the small victory, the success in the moment. It’s re-racking or lowering a weight with quivering muscles, the electricity flowing through your body. At the <em>success</em> in the moment. There is purpose to this suffering.</p>
<p>And that’s why we do it.</p>

  <p>Spring has sprung like a boner in a strip bar and beach season is just around the corner! Paleo for Lifters (PFL) is the perfect complement to <strong><a href="/books/the-70s-big-lp/" target="_blank">The 70’s Big LP</a></strong> and just what you need to prep you for tank top weather.</p>
<p>If you’ve been on the fence about purchasing PFL you’re in luck because <strong>now it’s just $24.99!</strong> Buy it <a href="/books/pale-for-lifters/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Here is what some of your fellow readers have to say about PFL:</strong></p>
<p>“Definitely one of the best e-book purchases I’ve made. Clear, descriptive writing, no typos (Jesus, the typos in other people’s “edited” work that I’ve *paid for* astounds me), and information that I have not been able to find elsewhere.” -Will</p>
<p>“I routinely refer people to the book as a concise and practical introduction to paleo dieting within the context of strength athletics.” -J.T.</p>
<p>“Paleo for Lifters provides the trainee with a great insight into how the Paleo diet and derivatives thereof can be used to fuel the body for strength sports. Justin Lascek successfully instructs the reader in planning a clean diet that not only supports strength training but can also be tailored to build an ideal body mass and composition.” -Andrew</p>
<p>“I absolutely love Paleo for Lifters! It showed me how to eat clean but eat big for needed fuel. At 6’4″ 200 lbs and a Crossfitter/Mountain Biker I can’t afford to skimp on muscle building food.  Paleo for Lifters got me back to getting stronger not constantly struggling on low energy eating. ” -Lester</p>
<p>“Justin always cuts through to the most usable pieces of the information and ignores the silly shit. Very helpful.” -Kyle</p>
