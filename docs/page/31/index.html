  <p>_Mondays are dedicated to female topics. _</p>
<p>I’ve spent so much time trying to help guys get their the women in their lives training that I’ve neglected the gals who actually DO train. You lovely ladies actually carry the torch — the one that sets fire to bullshit conventional cardio bunny stereotypes.</p>

    This girl expects to be sore from stretching.

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/-tS6QfIZfKY" target="_blank">In this video</a>, Nick Offerman of <a href="/2012/07/RON-SWANSON-ADVICE.jpg" target="_blank">Ron Swanson fame</a> reads tweets by young female celebrities. Ashley Tisdale — who I honestly have never heard of before — said, “Cardio then yoga? I am gonna be sore!” This is a god damn joke. Aside from the fact that it’s one of those pointless-ass status updates that reflect the epitome of narcissism in American youth, the girl expects to be sore from repetitive movement on an elliptical, stretching, and posing. FUCKING POSING.</p>
<p>Ladies. This is what we’re up against.</p>
<p>Wait, this isn’t supposed to be about the enemy. Let’s try and ignore her internal rotation and thoracic flexion. Let’s try and ignore her complete lack of muscle mass. Let’s try and ignore the fact that if she were to be caught in a stiff breeze, she would fall apart.</p>
<p>No, this is about you ladies — you lifting, training ladies — carrying that torch, lighter fluid, and trebuchet to burn down the preconceived notion that being a useless human being WILL NOT STAND. I salute you, woman of barbell lifting.</p>
<p>Tell us about yourself. How did you get into lifting and serious training? Why do you like it? What do you hope to get out of it? There is no wrong answer, I’m just curious as to what was the catalyst for setting yourself apart from the waif or fat girl modern society expected you to be.</p>
<p>Continue to pave the way for serious female trainees by setting a good example. If possible, help your friends — male and female — try it out. Find your niche, whether it’s just getting stronger, powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting, or strongman, and stick with it. Train hard and have fun.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joel, <a href="/blog/2012/09/qa-43/" target="_blank">from this Q&amp;A</a> asks:</p>
<p>Quick question: I have been experiencing achy elbows lately, especially my right one. I’m not doing anything different that I am aware of, but mobbing and stretching them seems to do nothing. I’m guessing it is probably the beginnings of tendinitis and it may stem from grip width during low-bar squatting, but it never ever bothers me until I’m outside of the gym doing random stuff. The most painful thing is gripping a full glass with my (right) arm fully extended and the pain gets worse if I were to dump the glass out to the right. What would you recommend I do to diagnose/fix this issue and prevent it from happening in the future? I know a recent vid of my squat would probably help immensely, but I never film myself since I train foreveralone.jpg in a globo…so I will work on getting one asap.</p>
<p>I’ve also been hitting a wall with the Texas Method, which I’ve been running strictly for 4 months now after buying your book in June – No real PRs in, like, 3 weeks. I’ve been feeling good, mobbing, and eating like a horse (at least getting 1g protein/1lb BW) but just not feeling any stronger. Is it time to get advanced with my TM template (I’m hesitant to do this since I haven’t been on it that long), or just change up some of the set/rep schemes for now? Some numbers:</p>
<p>5’5” – 175lb – 33y.o.</p>
<p>VD SQ – 295x5x5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OHP – 120x5x5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BP – 185x5x5</p>
<p>ID SQ – 365×5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OHP – 140×5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BP – 205×5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DL – 395×3</p>
<p>I can’t say it enough, but thank you so much for all of your help thus far, Justin – You’re advice has proved invaluable and I can’t wait to see how much better and more useful in general you can make these aging and broken human beings – – Keep it up! (sorry for the novel, btw)</p>
<p>-Joel (aka. blister)</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>**Dear Joel, **</p>
<p>Good to hear that your wife is doing better (he explained this in the e-mail, but I omitted it for space). Once you guys get back from the vacation, get on a regular exercise regime — start with at least 2x/wk with other days for walking (have dogs?).</p>
<p>Regarding your elbow, I’d first assume that your squat grip is what is irritating it. This is actually quite common. You can see some discussion on this from <a href="/blog/2012/05/qa-27/" target="_blank">Q&amp;A – 27</a> and <a href="/blog/2012/06/qa-28/" target="_blank">Q&amp;A – 28</a> (just ctrl+F “grip”). Improve shoulder mobility and grip position on the squat and do some soft tissue massage up and down stream from the area of injury. The former will fix the underlying problem while the latter can help treat the issue itself.</p>
<p>Regarding your lack of progress on TM, your volume squat work is only about 80% of your intensity squat work, so you can actually stand to increase the volume a bit more. I’d say stick with the 5×5 and increase the weight a bit and see what happens on that particular lift. As for the other lifts, there isn’t a whole lot of info here to go on, but your bench volume is 90% of your intensity bench work, and that is a bit high. Either reduce it down to a 3×5 on the Volume Day or reduce the weight overall. Your presses are also a bit weak, and in this type of situation I usually like to recommend weighted pull-ups once or twice a week and later adding rows into the mix as well. Filling out the upper body strength and musculature helps drive the presses, but also be sure to check out this press video (the elbow positioning is important while benching too, these videos may help: <a href="http://youtu.be/WRCI3By2WUA" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdnh5uX12lM" target="_blank">two</a>):</p>

</div>

<p>Lastly, you need to eat more protein than just 1g per pound of body weight. Check out this “<a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">PROTEIN</a>” post, but I would add 50g on top of what you currently get. I suspect that you’ll start making progress after a week straight of the additional 50g (the new intake needs to be chronic, not a “sometimes” thing).</p>
<p>More in a bit.</p>

</div>
<p>You guys will never believe all of the Brent look-a-likes I’ve been running into! For those of you that have been living under a stupid rock, Brent is my friend (and you’re not). He became infamous via his <a href="/shrugthug/" target="_blank">training log</a>, and nowadays is pretending to run <a href="http://mopeilitywod.com/" target="_blank">MopeilityWOD.com</a>. <strong>He also sells some pretty sweet shirts <a href="http://mopeilitywod.spreadshirt.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a></strong>. To give you some perspective, I’ve had a 48 year old Australian man ask me, “Does Brent really act like that in real life?”</p>
<p>You can watch him compete in weightlifting or powerlifting, but to really understand the psyche of Brent, you can start with these videos: “<a href="http://youtu.be/NoTYAlMy57I" target="_blank">Brent’s Traps</a>“, “<a href="http://youtu.be/B_WcSTvZR1k" target="_blank">Brent Gets His IT Band Released</a>“, “<a href="http://youtu.be/c9lCClD8Ci0" target="_blank">Mobbin’</a>“, and my personal favorite, “<a href="http://youtu.be/7mTt9znXMK0" target="_blank">Aquarium Trip</a>“.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve strangely noticed how so many people out in the world look like Brent Kim. In June, Chris and I took this photo with our waiter, because he bore a striking resemblance to the sexually frustrated Brent Kim.</p>

<p>We couldn’t believe how many Brent Look-a-likes we found! I can assure you that as I encounter them, I will photograph and document the moment for your viewing pleasure.

    Exhibit A. The way it used to be.
  </p>
</div>
<p>There was a time.</p>
<p>A time when manliness was an aspiration. Desired. The epitome of adulthood. A woman wanted a warm, burly embrace complete with a chest hair snuggle. Nowadays the average lass cuddles with a spidery, non-lensed glasses-wearing waif who bruises from a charlie horsed leg.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/VyFpOp8Ft0Q" target="_blank">HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?</a></p>
<p>This aggression will not stand. We must <a href="http://youtu.be/zK4h9xR7Dec" target="_blank"><strong>rise</strong></a> to action. <a href="/blog/2012/09/the-revolutionary-guide-to-manly-short-shorts/" target="_blank">The Revolution</a> has gained momentum; the resistance swells every day.</p>
<p><strong>Your mission, brother, if you choose to accept it, is to take flannel back from the hipsters.</strong></p>
<p>These vile creatures are a cancer to our withering society. They claim to be original and avoid the mainstream, yet one of their chief styles of clothing is something worn by manly men for decades. How the hell do they justify that? The result is our nation’s youth growing up to see a bunch of annoying pukes wearing “flannel”. The first decade of a child’s life is very important; their first impressions create the foundations of their mind, ethos, and philosophy. If we allow skinny hipster goobers to falsely represent a sense of manliness, then subsequent generations will aspire to be thin, incapable, and irrelevant. We cannot let this happen.</p>
<p>The weather grows chilly in the northern hemisphere and it is our duty as big, strong men to reset the standard. It is our density. Here are the steps to completing yet another mission in The Revolution.</p>
<p>**1. Know thy enemy. **</p>

    Exhibit B
  </p>
</div>
<p>****Ladies. Gentlemen. This is what we’re up against (Exhibit B). In your journeys you will come across a shriveled excuse for a male: the hipster. He will don the flannel, as his wont. Your goal is not to engage him in mortal combat, yet to alpha the shit out of him in a respectable manner. Enter the room with confidence and a smile; it will immediately over power his internal shoulder rotation, thoracic flexion, cervical flexion, and atlas extension. And you better believe his pelvis is posteriorily tilted.</p>
<p>If the enemy follows you into the room, make sure to hold the door open. After all, it’s something you should automatically do for all females, especially when you mistaken the dainty hipster for one.</p>
<p>If you must engage the enemy in conversation, introduce yourself with a firm, but not aggressive handshake. His limp-fished hand will tell the real story. It’ll help if your hands are weathered. You probably have accomplished this by lifting weights, but it helps if you chop wood, drink whiskey, or spend time outdoors. The hipster, for example, is not strong enough to even swing an axe.</p>
<p>Smile. Converse. Be polite. Be yourself. For if you act like yourself, you have already won because the hipster is trying to be something he is not. This creature <a href="http://youtu.be/0vBpcSEdcRc" target="_blank">wants. to. fit. in.</a> He will do and wear anything to be a part of a group that is the pukish spawn of urban middle class poons. Christian Lorentzen of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_New_York" title="Time Out New York">Time Out New York</a></em> claims that metrosexuality is the hipster appropriation of gay culture, as a trait carried over from their “Emo” phase. He writes that “these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a> are assimilated—cannibalized—into a repertoire of meaninglessness, from which the hipster can construct an identity in the manner of a collage, or a shuffled playlist on an iPod” (<a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/why-the-hipster-must-die" target="_blank">source</a>). They essentially think they are cooler than America — and NOBODY is cooler than America (see Exhibit C for proof).</p>

  <p id="caption-attachment-5143" class="wp-caption-text">
    Exhibit C. Nothing is cooler than America.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Do not try and beat the hipster at his own game (which is hypocrisy . Merely present yourself as the amiable manly man you are. It will help if you have chest hair, own at least three knives, or have recently started a fire without matches (and preferably not accidentally in a house). You don’t have to comprehend the enemy, but knowing that he aims to not conform by conforming to an irrelevant cultural style will let you conquer him with standard, old-school manliness.</p>
<p>**2. Choosing your flannel. **</p>
<p>****It’s very important that your flannel is not marketed toward the enemy. Don’t shop in teen or urban sections. In fact, reconsider your clothing store if it has these sections. Outdoor stores are a good start, but I’ve had success at Kohl’s and Goodwill in the past.</p>
<p>Note that cheaper flannel shirts are made of cotton. If you plan on doing any outdoorsy adventuring, aim to get wool or synthetic types of flannel. Cotton is death in the woods because it absorbs water and doesn’t dry quickly. It’s not manly to die in the woods alone.</p>
<p>Aim for the classic flannel look. Hipsters, emo kids, and skateboarders are trying to popularize obnoxious patterns and colors. Before you make your purchase, ask yourself, “Can I wear this outside in a snowy forest and not look like a fuck-head?” If the answer is no, do not make the purchase and consider burning the building down.</p>
<p>**3. Wearing your flannel. **</p>
<p>Look, I don’t know anything about fashion. But I do know that you shouldn’t ever — EVER — button the top button on your flannel. Especially without buttoning the other buttons, cause then you’ll just look like <a href="http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/pictures/konnan2.jpg" target="_blank">Konnan from WCW</a>. I’d also question buttoning that second button because it’s a very hipster thing to do. Why do they all do it if they all do it? I thought they were trying to avoid conformity? I guess wearing black-rim glasses, even en mass, really sticks it to the man, huh? Let your neck breathe.</p>
<p>A shirt is optional, but if you forego the under shirt make sure that you have chest hair. Unless they look like pubes. If they look like pubes then chicks aren’t gonna want to snuggle it. Actually, let’s just make a rule that you have to bench 300+ in order to wear flannel without an undershirt.

    Exhibit D. Aim to be mistaken for the Brawny Man.

</div>
<p>The best way to wear flannel is to role the sleeves up to right below the elbow. This allows you to tease nearby females with your forearm power, but it further establishes the stark difference between you and a hipster. Most hipsters will have bony protrusions coming out of their flannel arm holes. If you are concerned by a lack of forearm development, then promptly throw in several thousand reps of hammer curls a day. By having rippling steak forearms, you’ll fit the archetype of “man” or “lumberjack” — you know, the things that flannel-wearing emits. This is what we want and need; your flannel presence should be memorable. Not “memorable” in the sense that you drink so much whiskey that you flip tables after standing on them while air guitaring, but if someone refers to you as “The Brawny Man”, you did your job. You want people to go home and say, “God DAMN did that guy look manly in that flannel.” They should either a) want to look like that or b) want to find and romance a dude that looks like that. The latter applies to females, but if it’s two consenting dudes then I guess that’s cool too.</p>
<p><strong>Fight the Good Fight</strong></p>
<p>Remember, every time you clothe yourself in the morning you make a statement. Do you want that statement to say, “I will conform to how skinny, no-lifting puke-faces are shaping modern society”? Or will you say, “God damn it, I’m a man”? We shall take back America.</p>

  <p>I’ve always wanted to help get women in the gym and restructure their concept of “optimal body image”. I’ve written an entire series titled “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=getting+girls+to+train+site%3A70sbig.com&oq=getting+girls+to+train+site%3A70sbig.com&sugexp=chrome,mod=0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Getting Girls to Train</a>” about it. At the same time, we all agreed in “<a href="/blog/2012/09/the-fat-epidemic/" target="_blank">The Fat Epidemic</a>” that while we despise excuses that prevent someone from being healthy, we will also be supportive of folks who are battling back from inactivity and poor dietary choices.</p>

Myesha has been consistently working out at CFED since 2011. She has completely altered her diet and trains at CFED at least 4 times a week. She has lost 45 pounds, dropped from a 16 to 8 in pants sized, and has gotten much stronger.</p>
<p>Say what you will about CrossFit, but say it can be effective.</p>
<p>My friend Jeremy, owner of <a href="http://www.crossfitannandale.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Annandale</a>, was talking to a new client in June. The girl said, “Isn’t CrossFit like a cult or something?” Jeremy, who is primarily a lifter (and has a cool barbell club class), smiled and said, “But isn’t it a good cult? What’s wrong with a group of people who like to exercise and eat healthy?” The girl was back the next day. The same thing happens with Jacob Tsypkin of <a href="http://crossfitmonterey.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Monterey</a>, Ruth and Sean at <a href="http://www.crossfitintrepid.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Intrepid</a>, all the folks at <a href="http://www.crossfitama.com/" target="_blank">Amarillo Strength and Conditioning</a>, and countless other places. Of course CrossFit can get weird, but Jeremy, Shana, and these other owners keep it real at their facilities.</p>
<p>These gym owners end up proving their worth with their personality and results. But more importantly, they provide a gateway. Women go to these facilities intimidated, but willing to see what it’s all about. Jeremy’s smile and Shana’s personality assure them that they’ll have a good time, and they do! It gets folks in the gym.</p>
<p>I don’t know if Myesha has heard of this site or cares about lifting (though she deadlifts around 360), but joining CFED provided the opportunity to a) improve her health, b) challenge herself, and c) provide the potential for getting into cool things like strongman, highland games, Olympic weightlifting, or powerlifting. I know that Jeremy has taken many people, including women, to strongman meets. One of the strongman compeitors is named Mary, who is 48 and squats 300 pounds! It all started because a woman decided to make the jump from “interested” to “trainee”.</p>
<p>This isn’t a post to praise CrossFit, but an emphasis on doing what we can in the grand scheme of getting women to train. Whether it’s in a garage, a fitness facility, or a CrossFit gym, helping a woman start that process of training —_ _not just working out, but _training — _is the first step. At the very least it could help her get healthy, but she could turn into an example of progress like Myesha or fierce competitors like all of the girls that post on this website (and yes, you’re still girls, so plbtttttt).</p>
<p>Lifters and serious performance trainees aren’t going to sprout out of the air. The seed must be planted, cultivated, and developed (this is not a metaphor for the horizontal rambas). Use the popularity of CrossFit, the Olympics, or professional sports. Help your female friends by providing a gateway into the gym. It will expose them to all of the fun stuff. And who knows? They might end up loving it more than you.</p>

  Rip is now teaching the press w/ dead stop every rep but using reflex off of hips forward to initiate each rep (<a href="http://startingstrength.com/index.php/site/platform_learning_to_press_2.0" target="_blank">here</a>) I currently press with a bounce in similar fashion to <a href="http://youtu.be/S-kF2iHbjRw" target="_blank">this video of AC</a>.

  Rip claims at the end of this vid that you can handle more weight in this newer way than the bouncing style because of more muscle mass involved. Is this true? I could see that there may be less chance of the bar getting forward with the newer way taught because of the exaggerated hips forward to initiate every rep. Whereas, with the bouncing style the most exaggerated hips forward initiation will occur on the first rep. Does it matter?
</h5>
<p> </p>

<div>
  <p>
    <strong>Dear Gurdeep,</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s break this down into a few topics.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. What is being taught. The &#8220;hip whip&#8221; prior to the start of the press is what is being taught. It was standard ops in Olympic weightlifting prior to &#8217;72. <a href="http://youtu.be/3nJrYPVJ88M" target="_blank">Exhibit A</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/7erVblY7aiU" target="_blank">Exhibit B</a> show you the technique. The &#8220;hip whip&#8221; is a push of the hips forward to lay back the torso with the bar on the clavicles or upper chest, followed by pulling the hips back to push the torso forward. This applies force to the bar to push it up, thereby helping the bar off of the chest. Note that in the videos, both lifters (including Serge Redding in the first video despite the front angle) are flexing and extending their knees. It happens quickly and was apparently difficult to judge, but there is clear knee movement in their presses. They then follow this hip whip with a layback, which was sometimes excessive. Rip&#8217;s CrossFit Total or pressing rules would limit layback to a line where the axillary (armpit) cannot move back past the glute &#8212; this was not the rule in pre &#8217;72 weightlifting. So, to clarify, the &#8220;hip whip&#8221; to start the rep is what is being taught by Rip in the video.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Can you handle more weight his way? On a single repetition, yes. Is there more musculature being used? Yes, but in a similar that there is more musculature being used in a push press. Instead of thinking about inclusion of musculature, we should look at what musculature is contributing to the movement. In this case, the hips and abdominals are being used to lay back and then jut the torso forward. This is different than the pressing muscles solely applying the force at the beginning of the rep.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. As for Gurdeep&#8217;s assumption that it would be harder to get the bar forward, this is not effected by the technique as the lifter will still need to keep the bar close to their face and get under the bar in order to prevent the bar from going forward. In other words, this hip whip does not effect forwardness of the bar.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. What is my opinion? My opinion is that I want people to use the press to increase their upper body strength, augment their bench press, and get bigger muscles with it (this doesn&#8217;t mean Rip disagrees, and I&#8217;m sure he agrees with at least the first two things). While more weight can be handled with this method, it is for a single repetition. On multi-rep sets, the lifter will need to do what AC does, and that&#8217;s seamlessly use &#8220;touch and go&#8221; reps. Touch and go creates a stretch reflex in the muscles which is why AC&#8217;s second rep is a little faster than his first. The point isn&#8217;t about the stretch reflex; the point is that the subsequent reps require different mechanics than the hip whip method.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even lifters who have received coaching do not press or bench well. Their grip is off, their elbow position is poor, and their shoulders do not have good external rotation. It&#8217;s why I made the unnecessarily shirtless video below (&#8220;<a href="/hall-of-fame/doug-young/" target="_blank">3 Press Fixes</a>&#8220;). We lifters are pressing for one of four things: a) to have a strong upper body, b) to augment the bench, c) to have a big, legitimate press, and d) to get jacked as a result of using the press. If a person is not properly externally rotating the shoulder (and therefore keeping the elbows &#8220;in&#8221; during the movement as opposed to flaring them), then none of these things are achieved. This means that the &#8220;3 Press Fixes&#8221; are more important than anything else.
  </p>
  <p>
    <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sqKhLR1zRaU" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally, I deem the &#8220;hip whip&#8221; as a more advanced technique. Barely anyone that I&#8217;ve coached in any setting &#8212; seminars or otherwise &#8212; has pressed with optimal technique. Until they did so, I wouldn&#8217;t worry about teaching a &#8220;hip whip&#8221;.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Besides, there are two problems with the &#8220;hip whip&#8221;. The first is that it encourages spinal movement, whether that is with anterior/posterior pelvic tilt or movement at the thoracic/lumbar junction. I don&#8217;t want trainees moving their spine under any circumstances during any barbell movement, so I will not bother teaching them something that opens them up to do so until they have solid mechanics (and a solid trunk).
  </p>
  <p>
    The second is that since I teach particular wrist, elbow, and shoulder positioning, it is not a requisite for the bar to sit on the clavicles or upper pecs. In fact, when people do this, it usually results in poor wrist position (see the video, the wrist is not a close-compacted joint, creates torque at the joint, and therefore reduces force application to the bar). If someone were going to hip whip efficiently, then they would want their torso in full contact with the bar &#8212; like on a push&#8211;press &#8212; to fully take advantage of the force application from the hip whip itself. The hip whip inherently accepts the fact that there is an arbitrary amount of upward force applied from the hip whip and therefore not being applied by the pressing muscles (shoulder flexors like the anterior deltoid and elbow extenders like the triceps). This fact could potentially be a deterrent for its use, though a counter point would be that there is more weight locked out at the top. Still, I&#8217;d rather have full muscle action through a full ROM as opposed to removing the muscle action in the very beginning of the movement. A hip whip press is similar, but not exactly like, a push-press in that the lower body muscles get the bar out of the bottom position.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third problem is that the hip whip encourages knee flexion and extension. This doesn&#8217;t mean it shouldn&#8217;t be coached, but lifters will not always have someone like Rip standing there telling them to do it correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Given that the hip whip encourages spinal and knee movement, reduces an arbitrary amount of force application from the pressing muscles in the beginning of the movement, and is overly complicated for beginner lifters who almost always cannot perform the basic mechanics (which will effect which muscles are utilized and how efficiently they act), I think that it&#8217;s not necessary to teach until someone is an advanced presser. Also factor in the fact that the press is not a competitive lift, and it just solidifies the lack of utility &#8212; especially for the average lifter &#8212; for this movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, I would not have a problem with someone using a bit of dip on their first rep to utilize a stretch reflex. This, of course, would not be allowed in a competition, but there isn&#8217;t a sanctioned competition for pressing so it doesn&#8217;t matter. The way it differs from the hip whip is that the pressing muscles are actually applying force on the bar from the very bottom ROM as opposed to the lower body moving the bar an arbitrary amount out of the bottom. A preceding stretch reflex makes allows greater contraction whereas the hip whip does not. You can see an example in the below video (Note: I am not a great presser and I would not accept this technique in a competition, but it&#8217;s used for muscle action and strength, not for competition).
  </p>
  <p>
    <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MS3Itmh34Fo" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    So, Gurdeep, for the reasons above, I do think it matters. I would only teach the hip whip to someone if their mechanics were solid and there was a competition in which the press were contested. Still, if they weren&#8217;t easily pressing over 200 lbs, I wouldn&#8217;t worry about it. Especially since a competition that will actually include the press with strict standards doesn&#8217;t occur very often.

&lt;div&gt;
  What do you think about programming deficit deadlifts for a period on a TM template? I currently doing a 5rm in deficit deadlifts on the intensity day. I&amp;#8217;m thinking about staying with this exercise for a couple of months, and will wait until my next meet (end november) to do a regular pull, and see how that goes.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Any thoughts and comments from you on this?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Thanks for a great site,

    <strong>Dear Chris, </strong>
  </div>
  <div>
  </div>
  <div>
    To be honest, I haven&#8217;t programmed deficit deadlifts that much or in the way you describe. Depending on the advancement of the lifter, I may be hesitant to administer them since they will slightly alter the mechanics. If a lifter&#8217;s normal deadlift mechanics are solid, then I don&#8217;t have a problem. The first instance that I would use them in would be as an &#8220;active deload&#8221; alternated every week. I got the idea from Johnny Pain in <a href="/radio/2012/09/20/podcast-ep-4-johnny-pain-programming/" target="_blank">this podcast episode</a> (also discussed a little <a href="/blog/2011/06/more-random/" target="_blank">here</a> in the first question). Basically an active deload would alter the movement so not as much weight was used to reduce the stress. In the case of deadlifting heavy every week, a lifter may benefit from alternating that heavy week with a lighter stress day. This is what I essentially do in the <a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">Texas Method: Advanced</a> by alternating heavy and speed deadlift days, but you could do the same with something like deficit deadlifts.

    Anyway, your question is just asking about them in general. In general, I don&#8217;t really have a problem with you doing it. However, I do have a problem with you not doing a regular pull until your meet. I&#8217;d rather you get a month or so of pulling regularly because the deficit will slightly alter your mechanics. Several years ago when we were using the terrible &#8220;halting deadlift&#8221; to try and push deadlift strength (which it didn&#8217;t), it significantly altered mechanics where the fellas didn&#8217;t like it at all. I don&#8217;t know if the deficit deadlift will significantly alter your mechanics, but that&#8217;s not a chance I&#8217;m willing to take. Besides, I think you could get better progress by using a different approach (like the aforementioned <a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">Texas Method: Advanced</a> stuff). This does NOT mean that your approach will be unsuccessful. I&#8217;m curious to see how it goes, because it will essentially allow you to linearly progress the deficit dead every week. You are actually handling less weight than you normally could on a regular deadlift, and it could possibly help your off the floor strength (though this is not typically an issue with guys who have trained properly).
  </div>
  <div>
  </div>
  <div>
    Let us know how it goes. Be sure to point out what program you were using in the preceding months before going to the deficit deadlift and detail your progress by using it. I would still have you do some conventional pulling in the final month (but not anything heavy within 7 to 10 days of the meet).

    <strong>Dear Ritchie,</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    You&#8217;ll feel weaker because of the hormonal change due to the (assumed) modest peak and time off. The first week back should be considered a ramp up week. You could ascend your volume work and keep the weight a little lower on that first day. It&#8217;s also not a bad idea to do a Light-Medium-Heavy set up on that first week back. This is standard though. You&#8217;ll be back to crushing weights in no time.

<p>Manly deeds: 1) completed navigation and tour of the California coast with my new wife in a rented mustang convertable. I’d never been there before and neither had she. Most days I wore short shorts, except for when it was too cold I wore pants similar to vietnam-era BDUs. One day we completed a 10-mile loop through a state park in Big Sur covering stunning beaches, mountains and redwoods, all without a map. I mean I looked at the map at the entrance, then went with it from there. I didn’t want to leave. During this time I grew a beard as a place holder so that I could have a mustache (not really possible to grow a mustache solo IMHO). Day 10 I shaved the beard with a shitty disposable razor and left the mustache. When I got home my electric shaver was packed in a moving box so I shaved 18 days of growth off of my lip with a dull disposable razor. 2) This morning I noticed one of my chest hairs almost touches one of my throat hairs. They day the two sections legitimately merge will be nothing short of monumental in my life.</p>

<p>– i took my friends with their girlfriends to the gym . and thought them all to squat, soo 4 people more squatting:D girls loved it. that’s all, not quite a lot..</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Basically taedoju is saying that he helped a mentally handicapped girl in the gym. My older brother is mentally handicapped and I grew up around a lot of handicapped kids, therefore I have a special place in my heart for them. Most people are afraid to approach them since they are different, but they typically really enjoy interaction with people. Taedoju wins the manly award for going out of his way to communicate and help with the mentally handicapped girl; it’s a really kind thing to do. The kind of thing a man does.</p>

  <p>My last six nights have looked like this: camping in the truck, camping in the tent, Great American Beer Festival shenanigans, local brewery Shenanigans, GABF shenanigans, and then camping above 10,000 feet in the snow. Needless to say I was a bit knackered after all that adventuring and drinking — IT’S WHAT DUDES DO!</p>
<p>During those six days I trained twice, not including hiking and the inevitable core workout that comes from off-roading for hours at a time. While the first time was at <a href="http://www.crossfitlodo.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Lodo</a> on Friday, the second time was at the gym hotel (which was equipped with machines and dumbbells up to 100 pounds). This is a short guide on training with limited time or equipment, but is mostly focused on being in a different location (as opposed to trying to get a workout at home).</p>

</div>
<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
<p>Think about what the foundations of your fitness or performance entail: strength, mobility, and endurance. If you’re exclusively a strength athlete, that will include power and swollertrophy. High intensity conditioning and muscular endurance would be relevant to an endurance athlete, fitness competitor, or even “applied fitness” trainees (a term we use in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497063/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0615497063&linkCode=as2&tag=70sbi-20" target="_blank">FIT</a> to signify someone who requires fitness for their job, like a fireman or soldier). Mobility is inherently important to all trainees and provides the capacity to get strong and muscular. At the very least your skewed training schedule will give you time to work on your mobility, and that may be enough for some people. You can create a workout that fits your training style, but you can also do something simple to “get the blood flowing”. Increasing the heart rate and moving through a full range of motion — not necessarily at high intensity — can aid recovery, relieve stress (especially if you’re on a busy work trip), and provide a positive stimulus to fuel regular training after returning home.</p>
<p>**Bring as much as you can. **</p>
<p>If you literally won’t have any equipment, you can improvise with what is available to you. For example, chairs can be dipped on, stepped on, or used to elevate the feet for push-ups. Otherwise bring as much small pieces of equipment as you can. Light bands and a jump rope can easily fit into a carry-on bag for band pulls and very light conditioning. Otherwise bring your mobility gear and work on your problem areas.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the goal?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you clarified what type of trainee you are and have acquired available equipment, what is your goal for the session? If it’s just to get the blood flowing, just jump rope and do some calisthenics. If you are a strength and power athlete, then use speed and explosive work. If you are a general trainee, then use assistance exercises to aid the strength lifts or catch a contagious, World Health Organization-worrying pump. If you are an endurance, applied fitness, or conditioning trainee, then use the light weights and your body weight for higher rep sets for muscular endurance or go ahead and get a high intensity conditioning workout.</p>
<p><strong>Explosive Work</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most under-utilized style of training in limited environments, yet the most effective. If the dumbbells only go up to 50 pounds, then press them (with a neutral, palm-in grip) for speed doubles or triples on the minute. Hold the dumbbells and do speed squats or deads. Do three pull-ups on the minute as fast as you can. Use different jumps like squat jumps (i.e. preceding the jump with a full squat), high jumps (i.e. jumping as high as you can), broad jumps (for horizontal distance), triple jumps (i.e. same as broad jumps, but using the landing of the first and second jumps as an immediate stretch reflex for subsequent jumps), or bounds (i.e. jumping for horizontal or vertical distance off one foot at a time. In the past I’ve alternated jumps with presses on 30 second intervals.</p>
<p>Keep the speed or plyometric structure simple and do two or three reps on a 30 to 60 second clock and do 5 to 10 sets.  The idea of timed plyo work is to demand that the muscle fibers contract as fast as possible while fatigued — the fact that they are doing it in a fatigued state is the thing that they aren’t adapted to (i.e the adaptive stress). Speed work will help improve rate of force development and neuromuscular efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Assistance</strong></p>
<p>If you’re tired, unmotivated, injured, or have crusty mobility from sitting all day and don’t want to jump around, just hit some assistance exercises that will either push your main lifts <em>or</em> give you some maximum jackage. The former may include dumbbell or banded good mornings, weighted lunges, or even holding a heavy dumbbell and do Zercher or front squats. The latter could include a few sets of dumbbell bench or press, triceps press downs, pull-ups, dumbbell rows, or weighted back extensions. Oh, and curls. Do at least one thousand repetitions of your choice curl and then go out of your way to tell everyone about it (i.e. co-workers, hotel employees, children in the swimming pool, etc.). It’s the curl that will give you the most bang for your buck since it hits both heads of the biceps and incorporates the brachioradialis of the forearm.</p>
<p>Notice that most of these exercises are compound movements that will improve the main lifts, but still improve muscularity. Realistically you could forego all of this advice and just do <a href="http://youtu.be/KBHu_wi5FaI?t=3m2s" target="_blank">shirtless chest flies in front of the mirror while chewing gum</a>, but I digress.</p>
<p>You may also remember “<a href="/blog/2011/08/when-in-doubt/" target="_blank">When In Doubt…Train Your Back</a>“, a post I wrote about training the back side when short on time. But don’t forget other necessary exercises like farmer’s walks and side planks. Having a whacky schedule is the perfect opportunity to do pre-hab exercises or improve your grip.</p>
<p>** Conditioning**</p>
<p>It’s really not hard to get a solid high intensity conditioning workout in with limited equipment. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497063/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0615497063&linkCode=as2&tag=70sbi-20" target="_blank">FIT</a> I give plenty of examples, but aim to use compound, multi-joint exercises that use a lot of musculature to use a lot of energy to create a deficit in substrates for a quality adaptive stress. If that sentence doesn’t make sense, then read through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497063/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0615497063&linkCode=as2&tag=70sbi-20" target="_blank">FIT</a> because we break it down Crayola style there.</p>
<p><strong>Just Do It</strong></p>
<p>The biggest issue with training during a weird schedule is actually getting off your ass and doing it. On Saturday, we were hungover and tired. In a few hours we were going to jump back into the fray at the GABF, but I decided to get a quick workout in the hotel facility. After a bit of jump rope, dumbbell bench, dumbbell front squat, machine rows, banded good mornings, and back extensions, we felt much better (I did press and weighted pull-ups the day before, otherwise I would have pressed the DBs and done the pull-ups). When you’re on a trip that has halted your training, strung you out, and possibly left you hungover, a quick muscle contraction workout will help immensely.</p>

Tuesday was a reiteration of the idea that instead of comparing yourself to someone strict pressing 260 for reps, <a href="/blog/2012/10/play-the-hand-youre-dealt/" target="_blank">be the best you can be with what you have</a>. Wednesday was a quick beautiful piece titled, “<a href="/blog/2012/10/ode-to-bacon/" target="_blank">Ode to Bacon</a>“. Thursday was an inspirational post about <a href="/blog/2012/10/never-give-up/" target="_blank">never giving up</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I’ve been solo adventuring/camping around Colorado and am now in Denver for the Great American Beer Festival with some friends. Beers I tasted include: bacon beer, peanut butter beer, combining the peanut butter beer with a blackberry beer (essentially creating a PB&amp;J), a beer made with BULL TESTICLES, and a beer that was so spicy I had to pray to the old gods to ask for forgiveness so that my soul would stop burning.</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>

<p>Justin,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m about to graduate this December with an exercise science degree. I’ve been interning since May with my school’s strength and conditioning staff and will continue until next May when I go to get my CSCCa. I don’t want to go to grad school in order to work at a college, but since I want to open up my own gym, I feel like I need to get some collegiate experience so I can better train people. What is your advice on this? Also, what certifications do you think are most important for a trainer to s&amp;c coach to have?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

<p><strong>Dear chief,</strong></p>
<p>It sounds as though you’re doing the internship to satisfy your undergraduate requirements, but why do you have to wait that long in order to sit for the CSCS exam? Either way, it isn’t necessary to work in the collegiate realm if you want to own a gym. It certainly wouldn’t hurt, but it’s not necessary. I helped out (like an unofficial internship) in my university’s S&amp;C program, but I was already owning/coaching CrossFit and had been personal training for a while. It’ll give you good experience for running classes, working with performance athletes, and seeing the logistics of a goal oriented facility.</p>
<p>All that being said, you could get in the gym industry without anything at all. I mean, look at all the people who start CrossFit facilities with just a few months of training experience. Sure, there are many CrossFit places that provide quality training, but there are also other facilities with coaches who have no business doing what they do. My only point is that the success of a gym business sadly isn’t solely dependent on the capability of the coach — this is a business that is dependent on the local market and the actions of the owner. If you are curious to talk more about business, I’m sure there are readers willing to do so (including friends of mine).</p>
<p>You already stated you don’t want to go to grad school so definitely don’t do it. It’s a slog, and you should only do it if you’re committed. As for certifications, I would sit for the CSCS as soon as you can. That really is the gold standard in the conventional fitness realm. I’ll point out that I don’t have it, but if I was going to get one to establish “credibility” for certain types of jobs or positions, that would be the one I would get. A certification doesn’t prove much, but some other good ones to have are USA Weightlifting and USA Track and Field.</p>
<p>Coaching and training isn’t about the letters after your name. And technically, education level (particularly S&amp;C knowledge) isn’t dependent on certifications either. Your success in a business will be decided on how much you care for your clients. Your success as a S&amp;C coach will depend on your ability to critically think, and I try and teach this skill through this website. Whatever you do, don’t stop learning.</p>

<p>Justin, I have a very important question. I wore short shorts to a crossfit competition this weekend that I attended as a spectator (for those who have never been/hate crossfit/whatever, go, it’s awesome) and I went to watch my friend compete but I was constantly surrounded by girls attempting to tear off my clothes. What can I possibly do to avoid this horrible side effect of manly short shorts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear NolanPower,</strong></p>
<p>****This is a normal, albeit unavoidable side effect. Recently I went to the grocery store right before midnight in short shorts and a tank-top. This funny guy I see regularly was there that night. A few weeks later he was checking me out at the register and I reminded him of that night (because I bought a three-foot banana squash because I thought it was funny). He says, “Oh yeah! You had those shorts on. We didn’t know if you were in a hurry or…if you were gonna kill us all…”</p>
<p>But then he said that the females enjoyed it. I say this because The Revolution is important. Every time a female sees you in short shorts, it provides a(n orgasmic) stimulus that alters her perception of manliness, masculinity, and attractiveness. Expose her with enough frequency, volume, and intensity, and she will soon forget that skinny guys have any relevancy in her life. This means that she’ll naturally select a mate who is burly, strong, and muscular. They may eventually mate and produce more stout offspring, thereby reducing the “skinny” variation from the gene pool. No, we’re not talking about ethnic cleansing, but we’re talking about fully capable humans and men in a time where frailty — both physically and socially — are glorified.</p>

  Justin, I have an athlete belt from Bestbelts which I&#8217;ve been using for the last two years or so.  I&#8217;ve developed a chronic lower rib (floating) pain on the back a few inches from the spine.  I&#8217;ve posted about it a couple times and someone asked if I had hyper lordosis but then never explained why they asked.  To answer their question, I do have hyper lordosis.
</div>
<div>
  In my limited knowledge of the body, I&#8217;m guessing that perhaps the lordosis causes most of the belts pressure to be applied to the top and bottom of the belt since it probably isn&#8217;t entirely touching my back, perhaps causing undue pressure/stress on the ribs?  Does that sound right? If so what are my options?  At this point I&#8217;ve stopped deadlifting with a belt and plan on taking it off for squatting as well to see if it feels any better after a couple of weeks.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  At this point I wake up with my ribs aching, they ache at work and especially ache when wearing body armor.
</div>
<div>
  What are my options? Learn to live with squatting and deadlifting without a belt?  Nylon belt? Thinner belt? I&#8217;m well into correcting my hyper lordosis with daily couch stretches and frequent psoas releases.  Would stuffing a shirt or towel in the hollow spot of my back between the belt help?
</div>
<div>
  Thanks for your time and keep writing great articles!

  <strong>Dear Kev B,</strong>
</div>

  First, you are correct that your first priority should be improving the hyperlordosis. Review this &#8220;<a href="/blog/2012/07/hyperlordosis/" target="_blank">Hyperlordosis</a>&#8221; post. You should also be looking to improve your posture by tightening your lower abs and glutes. In the post I talk about doing this every time you go through a doorway to help make it a habit. Keep the daily psoas and hip flexor work.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  As for lifting, you need to start lifting with a correct spinal position. On deadlift, it can help if you tighten your abs before starting the lift. If you consciously contract your abdominals, you won&#8217;t be able to anteriorly rotate your pelvis (see the above post to see what this means) and will avoid the position that is not only making your belt ineffective, but also irritating your ribs.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  I would need you to describe your rib pain clearly &#8212; is it the base of the rib at the spine or the intercostal musculature that gives you fits? Either way, this needs to be rectified because it will either reduce your stability because it&#8217;s not 100% or provide enough pain to the point that your stability will be hampered (the body usually tries to avoid pain, and this can put you in awkward positions and induce other problems in lifting). I would put a premium on side planks and rotational assistance exercises to see if it helps with the rib issue.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  It&#8217;s possible that your torso is short and a normal 4 inch belt is irritating your lower ribs. If this is the case, you can get a 3 inch suede belt or get a Harbinger nylon velcro belt. If you need to wear these in the short term, that&#8217;s fine. I would think that if you correct your mechanics that your regular belt will suffice (assuming a normal torso length). Whatever you do, the priority should be NOT hurting when wearing body armor at work.

  <p>By the time of this post I’ll be in Denver, Colorado for the Great American Beer Festival. I’ll also have been in the wilderness by myself for a couple of days, but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to teach and entertain through 70’s Big, but I also like to help you stay motivated, inspired, and ready to kick the wall down every time you train. Mike linked me the following video, and I thought it was powerful enough to share. If we can all keep this drive, motivation, and consistency in our lives, then impossibility is no longer in our vocabulary.</p>
