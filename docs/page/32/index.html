  <strong>Ode to Bacon</strong>

<div>
  Light the burner, woosh,<br /> the pan clatters to the grill.<br /> Unwrap the paper, treasure awaits inside.<br /> Black and silent burns the pan, this witches cauldron about to perform magic.
</div>
<div id="id_50742a423dba89544216319">
  <div>
    In mere moments, the silence turns to sizzling, cracking, popping.<br /> The aroma wafts up, intoxicating,<br /> but only a false phantom of the true blissful taste which awaits.<br /> Turning, browning, crisping.<br /> The anticipation is agony, an exercise in patience and restraint.<br /> It is time, the tongs lower in and victory is pulled out.<br /> Lowered to the plate like a newborn.<br /> It is time.<br /> You are mine.<br /> Bacon.

<p>That’s a 220 pound guy legitimately strict pressing 260 pounds overhead. For four. His knees don’t move and he’s not whipping his torso around. Impressive.</p>
<p>At USAPL Raw Nationals, AC had a shoulder tweak and was only able to bench 386 on his second attempt (at a 215ish body weight). In the meet write up, I said, “We’ll get the issue taken care of.”</p>
<p>Obviously the video above shows that we did. That and the fact that AC benched 405×2 on his final double recently. The major cue I gave him was to keep his elbows in on both movements (it maintains external rotation, distributes force across the triceps and anterior deltoid better therefore reducing stress on the A/C and glenohumeral joint, and allows for more efficient force application which makes a stronger press or bench). He’s also been using close grip bench as an assistance (I talk about the benefits and programming in <a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Advanced</a>) as well as some direct triceps work (i.e. push-downs).</p>
<p>The reaction most people have to AC lifting is, “Wow! He’s a freak! I can never be like that!” There was a similar discussion a few weeks ago on /r/weightroom (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/103f4x/i_ran_my_starting_strength_style_linear/" target="_blank">here</a>) about me. People think guys like AC, Chris, or even me are genetic freaks capable of unheard of feats. While we may lift well, it’s not because we have innate ability. It boils down to having an innate consistent and determined approach to training. All of my friends not only train with reckless intensity (with the exception of Brent who meanders to the barbell), but we aim to make our lifting, programming, and recovery better every day. I remember when AC pressed less than 185 and Chris deadlifted 440×5 — we are not genetic freaks. If anything, say that our obsession and focus is freakish.</p>
<p>At the same time it’s true that you may not ever get to press 260 for reps. That’s just reality. And it’s okay! If you started training in the last few years, most of us have many years on you. However, you shouldn’t gripe about it and feel like a bitch every time you go into the weight room. It’s okay that you’re squatting 230 while some fucking MASTODON is out there in the world doing his light volume work with 545 raw to full depth. We all start somewhere. Instead, decide to train your fucking dick off so that you can be the best at whatever your goal is.</p>
<p>There’s an amazing quote from _The Lord of the Rings _that had a profound effect on me when I first read the books in high school. Basically Frodo is bitching about the predicament they’re in and Gandalf lays down some Old Man Knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frodo: “I wish none of this had happened.”</p>
<p>Gandalf: “So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Being weak is definitely a disparaging situation. Are you going to let your weakness consume you, or are you gonna get up and _<a href="http://youtu.be/wwZBMH3VOfI" target="_blank">find that fucking dog</a>? _Make a decision to not give a shit what other people are doing; we all start somewhere. Decide to be the best you can god damn be with what you have. God damn it.</p>

  <p>Ladies. Gentlemen.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you how much I love <a href="/blog/2012/04/boobs/" target="_blank">boobs</a> (SFW). They are joyously loved by toothless children and men. They bring more joy to the world than Christmas and more smiles than a farting dog. Yet boobs are under attack.</p>
<p>Boobs are under attack by cancer in what is now called The Battle for the Boobs. We’re talking about un-checked aggression here.</p>
<p>THIS AGGRESSION WILL NOT STAND.</p>
<p>This year 70’s Big will participate in fundraising for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. If you have a spare doll hair, please donate to the <strong><a href="http://www.stayclassy.org/fundraise?fcid=213761" target="_blank">70’s Big Breast Cancer Fundraising Page</a></strong>. My goal for us is to raise $5,000 before 31 October. Do not feel pressured to donate large sums of money, but even a single doll hair will count towards the aggregate.</p>

  <p><strong>PR Friday</strong> gives you the opportunity to post your training updates or weekly PR’s and chat with other readers.</p>
<p>**The Weekly Challenge **asked you to cook at least once with your crock pot and post your recipe to these comments.</p>
<p><strong>Next Weeek’s Challenge:</strong></p>
<p>**Week In Review: **Monday was a quick post about some of the Mr. Olympia results, and focused on the <a href="/blog/2012/10/olympia/" target="_blank">female competitors who show consistency</a> in their training. Tuesday discussed <a href="/blog/2012/10/the-importance-of-back/" target="_blank">the importance of “back” in Olympic weightlifting</a>; reading that post could save your penis. Yesterday was a post on <a href="/blog/2012/10/mentally-tough/" target="_blank">mental toughness in rehab and training</a>.</p>

<p>Also, a question on exertion headaches. I read the post about passing out, but didn’t see any mention of headaches. I had a pretty serious one a few weeks ago, and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear nadavegan,</strong></p>
<p>Exertion headaches are not the cause of passing out (the post talks about how increases in vessel pressure or occluding the vessels can result in a white out). Exertion headaches in lifting are typically the result of irritating the neck muscles. This is one reason why I coach people to keep their cervical spine in neutral alignment (i.e. I do not have them look up on squatting or deadlifting, and I don’t ever cue “head through” on jerks or presses). Weirdly straining the neck can create a headache based on muscle attachment sites in the skull. Aside from learning to have neutral cervical spine position, massaging the neck muscles after training may help.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2012/09/qa-44/comment-page-1/#comment-29263" target="_blank">A reader noted</a> how the headaches were severe enough to visit the doctor and have an MRI done. It seems that these guys are developing the headaches by deadlifting for as many reps as possible. Note that you shouldn’t be allowing your form to break down into a shitty deadlift; it opens up various structures to injury, including the spine. When going for reps, aim to maintain proper technique (even if this means failing at an earlier rep range). You’ll get better work on the muscles, prevent injury, and not learn bad habits.</p>

    This is my first PR friday. Low back soreness more than usual from the squatting, is this normal when transitioning to TM from LP?
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;

  <p>
    <strong>Dear farvahgc,</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#8217;m glad you asked this, because this is pretty common. General low back soreness on a linear progression should NOT be there. It is an indication of doing too much work and probably not recovering. I would expect to see this from people who are deadlifting every other workout (which should only be done for a few weeks at most in people beginning to lift for the first time ever) or squatting three times a week.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are experiencing low back pain during your linear progression, even general soreness, then reduce your training load temporarily and re-evaluate your program. If you are squatting 3x/week, then modify one of the days or bring it down to two. If you are deadlifting more than once a week &#8212; or doing pulling work more than twice a week (to include power cleans, power snatches, RDLs, etc.) &#8212; then bring the deadlifting down to once a week and the pulling work to just two times a week. Things like weighted back extensions are fine, but accumulating a lot of squat and deadlift work throughout a week will create a recovery deficit, causing soreness, and then eventually an injury (usually some kind of tweak). Don&#8217;t let this happen.

  2 questions:&lt;br /&gt; 1. Can anybody link me to the diet recommendations for texas method with conditioning? I hear it is similar to paleo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  2. I work 24 hr shifts. I have implemented texas method on a 9 day cycle to match my work days (1 out of three days, lifting on the day before work, and resting the day after). Day 1 volume day. Bs bp/mp and a couple accessories. Day 2 power snatch or clean and conditioning all out. Day 4 light day. Day 5 conditioning interval oriented. Day 7 Lifting intensity day. Bs bp/mp dl. Day 8 conditioning all out or sustained effort. Day 9 rest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Can anyone comment on what i might expect from stretching the week and adding conditioning?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  <p>
    <strong>Dear snommisjay:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    First, your volume work is a bit high for a sustained Texas Method program despite you elongating the progression. The squatting volume is at or a bit above 85%, and the recommendation is that the average weight on 3&#215;5 Volume Day should stay under 85% of the weight used on the Intensity Day. You are at that limit with a 5&#215;5, so I would expect things to not work well soon. Also, your bench volume is almost 90% of your bench intensity. Again, this is not something that I recommend on this program. <a href="/books/the-texas-method-part-1/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Part 1</a> will clear this stuff up and explain why. The book also talks about using conditioning. The basic tenet is that if conditioning is interfering with your recovery &#8212; especially for the Intensity Day &#8212; then it should be reduced or removed. Placement and type of conditioning is imperative when on a strength program. The conditioning days I see being a problem are on Day 5 (after your light day and two days before your Intensity Day) and Day 8 (which is the day after your Intensity Day and two days before the next Volume Day). If you have to modify one, it may be Day 5, but run it this way and see how you do.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for the diet recommendations, you will need to eat adequate amounts of protein and calories to supplement your program and goals. Doing this with higher quality foods will yield better results in the short and long term. I am working on something that will detail nutrition for various goals, so keep an eye out for that.

  I´ve got a question i hope you could answer. I´m reading the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497063/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0615497063&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=70sbi-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; book chapter on mulit element fitness, and trying to use the &amp;#8220;decision tree&amp;#8221; on p. 175 to decide what kind of intensity to use in my endurance traning after lifting weights. Right next to my gym we have a 400m running track so i figure it´s time effective to use it. I also need the running. My question is this: would this be a sufficent breakdown of the intensity &amp;#8220;zones&amp;#8221; with regards to trackrunning?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Tabata: 20 sec all out run, 10 sec pause &amp;#8211;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Short max effort: Running hard for less than 5 min.&lt;br /&gt; Long max effort: Running hard for less than 10 min.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Thank you for the 70s big community and traning philosophy btw. It´s intelligent, down to earth and lots of fun. That´s more than can be said for most of the other strength training websides.
&lt;/p&gt;

  <p>
    <strong>Dear Jonas, </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Your break down is decently accurate. Just remember that high intensity conditioning is relative to what the person is currently adapted to. In the book it details how 15 minutes of speed walking is enough for a de-conditioned person. Note that in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497063/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0615497063&linkCode=as2&tag=70sbi-20" target="_blank">FIT</a> it provides a recommended type of conditioning relative to the volume and intensity of the lifting.

I recommend sticking to the 10 seconds of work and 20 seconds of rest structure when outside.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for the short and long max effort sessions, running in those time frames could work, but they may not achieve an intensity high enough relative to your capability. A short max run could be sprinting an 800m while a long max run could be running a mile for time. Doing those efforts as fast as possible are certainly stressful, but just keep in mind that combining running with other activities can up the stress. Also note that running is best improved through interval training, and the total time of an interval session will last longer than 5 or 10 minutes. You could remove the rest periods and just add up the total running time in an interval workout to see if it will fit in the 5 or 10 minute limit. But since you have the book, you have plenty of examples on how interval training can be conducted, including how it can be used relative to the lifting session. Note that running is much harder after heavy squatting, deadlifting, or posterior chain work.

  <blockquote>
<p>“Any sort of injury is just you being mentally weak. That includes getting shot.”</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A friend who works in a higher tier special operations unit recently said the above quote to me. It was in reference to my recent hamstring injury, but there’s more weight in these words.</p>
<p>Injuries can be great or small, yet it’s up to the person to decide how they’ll let their injuries affect them. There will be injuries that prevent specific activities — doing an exercise or a type of job — but the rehabilitation rate is relative to perception.</p>
<p>Consider two dichotomous mindsets. Two people have muscle strains that require massage to break up the scar tissue. The area is tender and painful. When the massage begins for the first person, whether administered by a friend or self, they tense up and contort their face in pain. The second person welcomes the pain calmly, knows they will endure it, but does so stoically. Their massage, rehab, and recovery will be more efficient not only because of their acceptance, but their bold mindset going into it. They don’t cringe at discomfort; they let it wash over passively.</p>
<p>Pain is a part of life, and mindset determines perception. The mentally weak fear pain because, well, it hurts. It’s discomforting and upsetting. The mentally strong expect pain and are ready for it. They are willing to endure and ignore it. It takes a tough sonofabitch to look at their injury and say, “Let’s roll.” Whether it’s <a href="/blog/2012/08/ali-mcweeny-is-stronger-than-that/" target="_blank">a girl powerlifting with one leg</a>, a girl (who I know from high school) <a href="http://aimeecopeland.org/this-is-the-better-version-of-me-flesh-eating-bug-victim-aimee-copeland-says-she-is-celebrating-being-alive-as-footage-of-her-doing-pushups-is-aired/" target="_blank">who has lost her limbs</a> from a flesh-eating disease, or a <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/military/2011-06-19-afghanistan-iraq-army-rangers-amputee-purple-heart_n.htm" target="_blank">soldier who returns to combat</a> after losing a leg, it takes guts.</p>

<p>Pain and discomfort are relative to our situation, and we all aren’t faced with severed limbs or getting shot. But modifying our idea of pain can change our training, rehab, and life.</p>
<p>Again, consider two mindsets. The first approaches a difficult set of squats (e.g. 3RM, 5RM, 10RM, or 20RM) with dread and fear. They go through the motions of the set with failure as an option or possibility. The second approaches that same squat set aggressively, wanting to attack it. They are rabid; a caged, frothing animal ready to unleash hell on the bar. Which mindset do you think will be more successful?</p>
<p>Mental toughness in training will affect tenacity, bar speed, and completion of lifts. This doesn’t mean you should make stupid decisions on the account of “being tough”. Don’t make reckless decision, but use reckless intensity.</p>
<p>Mindset in rehab will be the difference between properly working structures and lack of progress. This is why Kelly Starrett tells you not to contort your face and go “into the pain cave” — it tenses your structures up and doesn’t work them properly.</p>
<p>Whether it’s training or rehab, embrace your pain. There is, of course, a difference between discomforting pain and injury pain. Each is a tool; the former is one that you will ignore while the latter informs you that your body is failing, even if your mind is not. People who are truly successful understand and use these pains every day. The next time you feel sorry for yourself, wincing in pain, just know that there’s a guy out there with a bullet hole in his body calmly rehabbing with reckless intensity.</p>

  <p>There are two dichotomous styles of weightlifting. One is sort of a relic of the past and puts an emphasis on jumping the bar up while the other focuses on efficiently getting under the bar. In “<a href="/blog/2012/01/jumpshrug-vs-catapult/" target="_blank">Jump/shrug vs ‘Catapult</a>‘” I briefly discussed the differences between these techniques. The primary difference is that if the bar is jumped vertically, the lifter and bar become “floaty”, making it difficult to have an efficient turnover to rack the bar. The “get under” method sets the lifter up to not only have greater turnover speed, but to use more efficient mechanical positioning to maximize their force production.</p>
<p>The key is that the “get under” method is necessary for lifting loads that are significantly greater than body weight. Personally I can tell the difference between the two methods; I was taught to use the jump method and have taught myself the “get under” technique, though I’m probably not perfect. I’m lifting the same PR loads weighing 15 pounds lighter and without back squatting for a couple of months. The “jump” method is good for general strength and conditioning (especially with non-lifting sport athletes), but it’s less efficient when trying to lift the most weight (i.e. Olympic weightlifting).</p>
<p>This post isn’t meant to be a full biomechanical analysis of the “get under” technique (that can come later), but the technique’s starting position and execution better produce a stretch reflex on both the quads and hamstrings. This not only allows these muscles to produce force maximally, yet makes the bar-lifter mechanics more efficient. For example, if a person is snatching significantly more than their body weight, then manipulating the bar-lifter center of mass is important, but it’s not as simple as making the bar “go up” vertically.</p>
<p>There are two standard cues used after the initial motor pathway of the lift are learned: “bar back” and “finish in the heels”. Keeping the bar back prevents it from swinging forward, disrupting the delicate bar-lifter system. Even slight alterations to center of mass with very heavy loads will create exponential mechanical problems that result in a failed lift. Finishing in the heels ensures that the lifter doesn’t put an emphasis on “up”, prevents the lifter from floating, and sets them up to transfer into their heals in the bottom of a snatch or clean. It also facilitates the finish “arched back” position — a necessary difference to snatch or clean heavy loads.</p>
<p>To keep the bar back, a lifter will actively need to extend their shoulder joint (if the elbow is straight, shoulder extension pushes the wrist behind the body — see the “<a href="http://youtu.be/13_Nq4QgALs" target="_blank">Anatomy Motion Explained</a>” video for a review). This same thing occurs on a deadlift to prevent the bar from swinging forward, but it’s absolutely critical in the Olympic lifts. It’s the difference between a good lift and a bad lift. For some, it can be the difference between a good lift and annihilating their dugan and coin purse. Observe what happens when the bar isn’t kept back:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJjGB5xtD68" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Okay, this might be an extreme example. My arm length may facilitate nut crunching, but leaving the bar out front changed the mechanics to bring the bar into my body at a different trajectory. Let’s look at the same problem on the snatch from earlier in the same training session. I had not snatched 130 in a while, and I was feeling good in warm-ups that particular August day. You’ll see that I miss 130 three times in a row. You’ll also see that it seems like I easily complete the lift, and then it falls forward. It’s because my lack of “keeping the bar back” puts the bar in a slightly forward position — maybe by a few  centimeters — and results in a missed lift. I even spiked my adrenaline for the second and third lifts to no avail. Finally, on the fourth attempt, I focused on keeping the bar back and made a good lift with significantly lower adrenaline levels.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6m_ZJG6qdZ0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>As a side note, look how different the mechanics are from <a href="http://youtu.be/iZFKv6dfmiI" target="_blank">this video</a>. Yikes.</p>
<p>I learned why keeping the bar back was important by missing a doable snatch three times in a row and smashing my sausage on a clean. Most of you probably won’t be able to discern your problems on the spot, so I suggest watching the <a href="http://californiastrength.com/olympic-weightlifting-videos/viewcategory/12/olympic-weightlifting" target="_blank">Pendlay teaching progressions on Cal Strength’s website</a> and routinely executing the basic cues (like “bar back” and “finish in your heels”). Your beef bugle will thank you.</p>

  <p>The Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition occurred this past weekend. I’m not a huge fan of the bodybuilding competitions, male or female, since it has changed so much than the “glory days” in the ’60s and ’70s, yet there are still some interesting categories that include competitors that we can learn from.</p>
<p>I’ve posted some videos of Kai Greene on the site before (including mentioning him in “<a href="/blog/2012/02/contraction-vs-moving-weight/" target="_blank">Contraction vs. Moving Weight</a>” and “<a href="/blog/2012/03/bodybuilding-fact-or-fiction/" target="_blank">Bodybuilding, Fact or Fiction?</a>“). Despite his best efforts, he only placed second at the Olympia underneath Phil Heath.</p>

    Erin Stern at the 2012 Figure Olympia
  </p>
</div>
<p>If you follow this site, you know I’m a fan of Erin Stern (I’ve written about her in posts such as “<a href="/blog/2012/03/hahd-werk/" target="_blank">Hahd Werk</a>“, “<a href="/blog/2012/07/the-enemy/" target="_blank">The Enemy</a>“, and “<a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-2/" target="_blank">Getting Girls to Train — Part 2</a>“). She seems to have a great personality, sets a good example for good year-round nutritional and training habits, and trains explosively (with track work and some Olympic lifts). Well, <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/2012-olympia-weekend-erin-stern-wins-figure-olympia.html" target="_blank">Erin won first place</a> in the figure category this past weekend, so congratulations to her (<a href="http://streaming.bodybuilding.com/2012-olympia-webcast/?q=figure-finals-introductions-replay" target="_blank">video of finals is here</a>). The figure category is a step down from the bodybuilding category — the latter consists of creepily ‘roided-out women while the former is a more natural, healthy look.</p>
<p>Other categories include bikini, which is a fairly new style of competition that puts less emphasis on muscle mass and seemingly has no quantifiable judging criteria (though it can be entertaining for men — <a href="http://streaming.bodybuilding.com/2012-olympia-webcast/?q=bikini-olympia-confirmation-replay" target="_blank">video of the finals for proof</a>). Another interesting female category is “fitness”; these competitors are judged on both their physiques as well as a fitness routine that requires impressive ability. This typically attracts shorter, athletic girls with gymnastics or dance backgrounds. 40-year-old <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/2012-olympia-weekend-adela-garcia-wins-seventh-fitness-olympia.html" target="_blank">Adela Garcia won her seventh Fitness Olympia</a> title this past weekend (<a href="http://streaming.bodybuilding.com/2012-olympia-webcast/?q=fitness-olympia-routine-finals-replay" target="_blank">video of the fitness routines here</a>). I’d also point your attention to Oksana Grishina, a Russian and former gymnast; her routine was pretty impressive and I’ve heard grumbling that she should have won.</p>

    Oksana Grishina is another role model for consistency and athleticism

<p>You may wonder why this post is about physique competitions when 70’s Big makes a point to acquire physique through performance training. I think that figure and fitness competitors set themselves apart from bodybuilding since their form is the result of function (especially for the fitness competitors). We poopoo bodybuilding as a whole, but the truth is that there are many good role models to look up to — consistent and hard-training people like Erin Stern or the impressive Adela Garcia, a 40-year-old woman who can “out-athlete” anyone half her age.</p>
<p>Sure, our end goal or training methods are different, but there is still a lot we can learn from these women. Erin Stern, for example, stays quite lean year-round with healthy eating — something that’s incredibly difficult mentally and physically. She commits herself to excellency not only in the gym, but outside of it. That is certainly a lesson that we, male or female, can benefit from.

  Hey Justin, couple of questions for the Q&A:1. Is there any marker to determine when would be a good time to switch to the TM Split? Just when you feel like it?</p> 
  <p>
    2. Think it&#8217;s possible to push up both the Press and Bench every week? I know you give a couple of scenarios in the TM Advanced but I&#8217;m talking Bench and Press Volumes and Intensities on the same day.
  </p>
  <div>
    3. I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot lately about doing a single heavier than your workset weight as part of the warmup so as to make the workset feel lighter. Any thoughts (specifically doing these on Volume and Intensity days)?Thanks</p>
  </div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>** Dear Chad,**</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Typically when things slow down in a linear progression. Should the linear progression be run until it’s a life destroying affair that renders the lifter useless for a week or so after their final workout? Probably not. As you know, I did that, and I don’t recommend that people do it anymore. However, if there have been several resets, and the lifter gets to the same weight every reset, then yeah, they are probably due for a programming transition (assuming there aren’t extraneous factors like technique or recovery that are causing this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hmm. I think it would be possible for an early stage intermediate. I’m not a fan of the “alternate the weekly emphasis from press to bench” in stock TM programs. Chad is referring to how in <a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Advanced</a> I provide many template examples of how to do both in the same week, though usually one day is “press day” while the other is “bench day”. But if someone were going to do try and get volume and intensity work with both exercises, they would probably need to only use a 3×5 for the Volume Day, and doubles or triples on the Intensity Day. Press may need to come first (since it’s less invasive than benching), but that would depend on what the trainee considers more important (perhaps their order could be alternated every week?). The second movement on the Intensity Day could be several sets of doubles instead of triples to avoid inducing any more fatigue on the muscles that would be there from the preceding exercise. Perhaps both lifts could just use doubles so that the total number of reps are lower for better Intensity progress? It’s interesting, and I’ve never done it, but I kind of like it for early stage intermediate and TM users. Or at least I like it better than the stock recommendation of alternating the lifts every week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing a single before the work set would provide a neurological effect of making the work set feel lighter, but I would not recommend this. There is still a physiological effect of getting a rep at a higher intensity. If I had Chris, Mike, or AC do this, then they would have less in the tank for their scheduled session, and it may even throw off the weekly stress. By getting a higher intensity rep on the Volume Day, it’s applying a different adaptive stress than what I’m going for. I see this being problematic for them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if we’re talking about people who are focusing their training on lower intensity with more volume or reps, then it may not matter. Yet, someone in this position would be a) lesser advanced or b) training just to maintain strength or muscularity within the context of their goals. If someone were regularly working to lift heavy weights every week (as in a Texas Method), I don’t see this being helpful and potentially being harmful. There’s a reason volume and intensity are fluctuated for raw, un-drugged lifters.</p>
<p>Besides, the warm-ups are supposed to appropriately neurologically prep the lifter. I would assume that some proponents of this method may not warm-up properly. Some of them probably warm-up fine enough, yet their program may not be finely tuned where a higher intensity single will disrupt progress.</p>

  Hey Justin, I had to workout with suboptimal weights for my latest intensity day. Weighed all the plates on a scale, some of them were accurate with less than half a pound difference, but some of them were off. 45&#8217;s weighed 40 lbs, the 35&#8217;s weighed 30 etc.Anyway, I made up for the difference in weight, and I think because I had to use steel instead of the bumpers I&#8217;m used to it messed everything up. Squat and press were hard, but I got through them. Deadlift I only got 2 out of my 3 reps.</p> 
  <p>
    27 Male 235 lbs
  </p>
  <div>
    For reference, today I did the following:Squat: 375&#215;5<br /> Press: 182.5&#215;5<br /> Deadlift: 460&#215;2 (wanted 3)</p> 
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  Should I repeat the same deadlift next week when I&amp;#8217;m back to the bumpers I&amp;#8217;m used to? Switch to 2&amp;#8217;s? Or move up? This is my 4th week on the Texas Method. Before this, I did 5-3-1 for 10 cycles, before that Smolov, before that Starting Strength, before that Crossfit. I have both eBooks so if there is a section you can point me to that works as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Thanks!

  <strong>Dear Michael,</strong>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  <p>
    Your volume is at 84% of your Intensity Day and you&#8217;re only in week 4. Typically the &#8220;cap at 85%&#8221; applies to 3&#215;5 as opposed to 5&#215;5. This means that the volume is higher than it probably should be at this point.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think that you started with weights that were too heavy on both the Volume and Intensity Days, especially since you are coming from 10 cycles of 5/3/1. Given that all of your plates were dicked up, you need to account for that in the progression (especially if bar weight is 5, 10, or 15 pounds different). If you are returning to a non-crappy gym with better equipment, then do what you can until then. Otherwise, do not increase your Volume Day and try and let the Intensity Day increase. Since your ID is hard already (as a result of you picking weights that are too heavy), it may take a weeks to normalize. If you think that the Intensity Days should not be hard, then you are probably doing too much volume (since you are doing a 5&#215;5 and just came from a lower volume program like 5/3/1, a 3&#215;5 on Volume Day is probably more appropriate).
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, if you have both books, then review the Intensity Day rep schemes. There are plenty of options you can transition to with clear instructions on how to use them. That means that you could probably use triples, or doubles, or another approach to allow you to hit get decent intensity work in.

  What are your thoughts on this uncoordination regarding movement patterns? and how to address it (especially in a group setting) without holding back other kids that pick up things faster?

    <strong>Dear Brian45, </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where the art of coaching a group comes in. CrossFit does a pretty good job of teaching their coaches to take the group through the progression of a movement together. This allows you to get some eyes on people during the progression. If someone has an issue, you can cue them simply enough. If it&#8217;s really bad, then you may or may not have the time to correct it, depending on the severity and length of time the correction would take. In such a case, continue the group&#8217;s progression, and you can focus a bit more on that person once the individual portion starts (if there is such a portion).
  </p>
  <p>
    The effectiveness of this process is dependent on the quality of simple, concise progressions to achieve the goal of a given movement. Rippetoe&#8217;s teaching method of the power clean differs from USAW&#8217;s power clean progression, but it&#8217;s incredibly simple (I taught a 65 year old cyclist to power clean in about three minutes in Rip&#8217;s gym). This particular power clean is good for general strength and conditioning, but may not be the best for Olympic weightlifting. On the weightlifting side, Pendlay&#8217;s progressions for snatch and clean are very simple and concise as well, yet they put different emphasis on the movement. In other words, the Rippetoe power clean puts an emphasis on jumping whereas the Pendlay clean/snatch puts an emphasis on proper positioning for optimal weightlifting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The above paragraph&#8217;s tangent provides two examples of good progressions that are simple, concise, and accomplish the intended goal. If you lack a progression, you&#8217;re not setting up the trainees for success. If the progression is poor, then you&#8217;re only going to make it difficult from a mental or physical standpoint.

  Justin, I posted this question under another topic and I’m hoping you’ll give me your thoughts: Do you think that a male having a 5rm that is a higher percentage of their 1rm could be a symptom of low testosterone? When I was younger (25-29) I used to be able to use the (reps x work-weight x .0333)+work-weight = max for bench and come really close. Now that I’m older (37), I’m finding that I can’t bench what my reps at 225 would suggest under that formula. One other fact is that I used to test my max relatively regularly and stopped doing that for a very long time. So, my question is basically: Am I turning into a woman, or do I just need to start lifting more at higher percentages of my max? Have you ever seen this before?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>Dear wayniac,</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Short answer: yes, probably. As males age, their testosterone levels decrease. It&#8217;s part of life, and it does not mean you&#8217;re turning into a woman. Sure, there could be a variety of factors that are inhibiting your lifting ability, but you know that each five year aging period will result in decreased recovery capabilities. This isn&#8217;t just because of the number of years you&#8217;ve been alive, but the physiological effect of aging, and lower testosterone does occur.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#8217;m not going to pretend to know much about aging and hormonal supplementation, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad thing to consider for men getting into their 40s. Testosterone is what makes a man a man, and when it goes down, tons of health issues erupt. I&#8217;m not even referring to performance, but health, and nobody is going to look after you other than you. Just a thought.

  <p>Whenever I teach and coach the press at seminars, the same faults show up.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grip width</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wrist position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elbow/shoulder position</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s a little difficult to discuss this without a visual aid, so I made an explanation video below after a press workout. <em>Starting Strength</em> does a good job explaining grip width, but for some reason people usually use too wide of a grip. I first wrote about proper wrist position on the SS forums in 2009, and it still is a common fault. Basically the bar needs to be over the heel of the palm instead of back in the hand or fingers. Lastly, over the last couple of years I’ve put more of an emphasis on maintaining proper external rotation during the press as it will distribute the force application through the full muscle bellies of the triceps and anterior deltoid. If these three flaws are present, then it will inhibit press progress. If you are doing these three things wrong, then it will behoove you to accumulate several weeks of work with lighter loads to develop and train the musculature through proper mechanics and range of motion.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.goruck.com/" target="_blank">GoRuck</a> is growing. What started as a small company making high quality packs quickly turned into a challenging adventure type event that is set apart from the en vogue “adventure races”. Again, I don’t know what en vogue means, but I think you can take penicillin for it.</p>
<p>I originally wrote “<a href="/blog/2012/03/challenge-yourself-goruck/" target="_blank">Challenge Yourself — GoRuck</a>” to provide another avenue of competition, introspection, and to introduce what GoRuck is. I then attended their challenge in Washington D.C. and wrote “<a href="/blog/2012/06/go-ruck-challenge-review/" target="_blank">GoRuck Challenge Review</a>“. I think the challenge itself is a valuable learning experience relative to the individual. In retrospect, I re-learned that part of leadership is getting people to do things that they don’t want to do when they don’t think they can do it. I also learned how hard my body can be pushed on limited resources before complications arise. In my case, I didn’t get enough water (I let others refill their water systems during the short breaks), but it took eight hours of grueling activity before the cramps started. “Grueling” includes over an hour of smoking PT, carrying a 1,200 pound log with the class for a couple of hours, carrying various people for several hours, running a 5k, and more all while carrying a 40 pound pack and often carrying other objects (team weights like a full jerry can or fire hose). I’ve since completed round trip mountain summits of 16 miles and over 8,000 feet of elevation change with no qualms about my ability to complete it. I had the confidence to know that it would take a lot more physical exertion before bad things happened.</p>

<p>The GoRuck Challenge is worth it. It will obviously be hard — for some people it’ll be the hardest thing they’ve ever done and an epiphany in their lives. At the very least it’ll give you an appreciation for what the military and SOF community goes through in their selection, every day jobs, and deployment.</p>
<p>As a side note, the GoRuck gear is of the highest quality I’ve ever seen. Critics often balk at the price, but I’ve compared my GR2 (the largest pack) with 511 gear, and there is honestly no comparison. I’ll do a review on my pack on my <a href="/justin/" target="_blank">personal log</a> since it leaves the scope of 70sBig.com, so look out for that if you’re interested.</p>
<p>**A lifter’s approach for training for a GoRuck will be unique. **I pointed out some basic points about preparing for an event in the <a href="/blog/2012/03/challenge-yourself-goruck/" target="_blank">GoRuch challenge review post</a> (under the spoiler below). These general recommendations apply to anyone, yet they didn’t dive into specific programming.</p>
<p>[spoiler]</p>
<p>– <strong>Program the S&amp;C portion around the rucking</strong>; it can and will jack up the structures for efficient strength/conditioning training</p>
<p>– <strong>Commit to daily mobility work</strong>; rucking bashes the shoulders, neck, thoracic and lumbar spine, hips, knees, and feet. Learn your problem areas and keep them up to speed; if you slack, they will fail.</p>
<p>– <strong>Progress rucking slowly</strong>; your body is not ready for 50+ pound rucks for several hours. Start light and short, and linearly progress it slowly.</p>
<p>– <strong>Cap the weight at 50 pounds and don’t run</strong>; there’s no need to run in training because it puts too much stress on the body. Just trust me. Some infantry guys may need to run a LITTLE bit in training to prepare for a 12 mile road march, but it can fuck things up.</p>
<p>– <strong>Progress the overall program slowly</strong>; the body won’t be hitting everything full speed with the addition of rucking. Don’t try and squat close to your repetition PR; allow your structures and system to adapt to the new straining stress.</p>
<p>– <strong>Aim to toughen the feet</strong>. I wore issue desert boots until recently for the sole purpose of toughening my feet. I had a blister in March 2011 on my first ever ruck (a friend was, uh, breaking me in), and the second time I had a blister was a month or so ago when I did 8 miles in 2 hours (some of it on sand). The boots are shitty with no custom work to make them more comfortable (blister was on the back of the heel). I recently got a pair of Rocky C4 deserts and wore them during the challenge (they are similar to Nike Free deserts, but the Nikes rubbed on my pinky toes too much for my liking). I did not have any blisters, and the 12 hours of the GRC was four times as long as I’ve ever gone with a ruck on. Also, my feet were constantly wet (streams, water fountains, rivers, etc.), which is the worst thing for blister development, but I didn’t have any problems.</p>
<p>– <strong>Learn about blisters and how to prevent them</strong>. <a href="/justin/index.php/2012/06/10/book-review-fixing-your-feet/" target="_blank">This book</a> is the best available if you’re a noob. It would be relevant if you’re into hiking or mountain climbing (I am). Learn how shoes and socks should fit. I wore dress socks under moisture-wicking socks to reduce friction on my feet; it was the first time I did it, and I had zero problems (other than really pruny feet from being wet for 12 hours).</p>
<p>– <strong>Learn proper hydration and electrolyte consumption</strong>. My longest ruck or hike has been three hours. When the sun started coming up, I started to have some small cramps in my quad (we had to do walking lunges). I was soon the TL, and my various parts of my legs from the hip down tried to seize on me during our movement (have you ever had your adductor muscles cramp?). I later had a full-blown calf cramp in the swamp. This all could have been prevented with better hydration; by the time I needed the water, it was too late. I had a water bladder, but I emptied it several times and couldn’t keep enough water in me. I opted several times during my TL stint to give my water to other people so that we could make time. The problem is that I have a lot of muscle mass, and it burns through water like an engine does gasoline. In the future I would have two bladders and drink on them constantly. My last several hours would have been much easier had I done so (I was pretty hobbled).</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p>I’ve rucked or hiked at least once a week almost every week for over a year now. Behind the scenes I work with various military and SOF personnel and rucking gives me perspective on their demands. Recently, I’ve done a lot more adventuring to include more longer, lighter efforts. My week may vary between a 60+ pound hour walk with the dogs in hilly terrain or an 8 hour, 16 mile affair with over 8,000 ft of total elevation change with about 30 pounds. Throughout all of this time, I’ve maintained or improved my strength, lean body mass, and body composition. I’ve hit PRs or almost PRs in the Olympic lifts several days after 15+ mile hikes. I’ve also bounced ideas off of various infantry and SOF personnel around the world; they are the guys that have the most experience with it. I’m giving you my perspective to validate the ideas presented below.</p>
<p>Most of all, this means I’ve learned what <em>not</em> to do. I’ve trained after brutal hikes and at best had poor training sessions and at worst tweaked something. It’s given me insight on preparing guys for combat, but it’s given me insight on how to arrange training in order to be an adventurer. Can you complete a GoRuck with little training? Of course; there’s not much you can do to prepare for a kick in the balls. However, the experience doesn’t have to be injurious. But it all starts with the basics.</p>
<p><strong>A Good Foundation Helps</strong></p>
<p>****This should be obvious, but having a basic capacity will facilitate quality ruck training. Guys in the military are often exposed to PT in basic training before loaded with a ruck. The exposure increases until they are finally doing a 12 mile road march, or other service equivalent, in a combat arms job. So it should be for you. If you have existing injuries in the ankles, knees, hip, or back, then work to eradicate or improve these issues prior to loading your body.</p>
<p>You’ll perform better and your body will hold up better when it’s strong. If you’re reading this site, then you won’t be entirely weak, so the real issue is getting you ready to handle rucking stresses. <strong>This stuff should be progressed in a respectful manner</strong>. I know 30 pound doesn’t seem like much, but put it on your back and walk for 45 minutes. Every non-military guy I know who has tried it was humbled.</p>
<p>I think that some basic pre-rucking qualifications for a non-conditioned lifter will be to run a mile or jump rope for five minutes without complication. Both are simple tasks that every human should be capable of. If either causes significant soreness (mostly in joints), then it would behoove the trainee to adapt to these activities. After all, the GoRuck will have some running, especially in a fatigued state.</p>
<p>Tough feet are important to prevent blisters. As part of the foundation, start going outside with your shoes off. Walk your dogs without shoes and spend as much time as you can outside. This will help harden the feet which only augments them when they are in a boot. If walking on concrete is painful, then toughening the feet is a useful and necessary human skill. You’ll be amazed at how sheltered people’s feet are.</p>
<p><strong>Get Time Under The Ruck</strong></p>
<p>The next important point is that you’ll need to get time under a ruck. Is it possible to do the event with zero rucking preparation? Yes. But if you read the challenge review, a kid named Ray didn’t have any preparation and he was <em>hurting</em>. Ray contemplated quitting a lot, but to his credit he finished. Yet he was literally hobbling to the finish because his feet and ankles were so badly beat up. While CrossFit can prepare folks for elongated activity, specificity is necessary because there’s no substitute for accumulating time with weight on your back.</p>

  <p id="caption-attachment-7850" class="wp-caption-text">
    Waterfall Canyon near Ogden, UT prior to the GoRuck Challenge. I carried about 20kg of rocks up this short trail wearing short shorts.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Start out light and short; 25 pounds for half an hour will do it. If you get done and think, “No sweat! That was easy!” Good. We don’t want to induce harm. Ruck at least once a week and at most three times a week with at least one day of rest in between sessions. If you’re going to train on the same day, then <em>ruck after lifting</em>. After any rucking session, if it spanks you, then repeat the weight and duration again before advancing either. <strong>Progressing the load or duration too quickly can inhibit your lifting and even result in an injury.</strong> Even minor tweaks from rucking can prevent squatting for a month.</p>
<p>I suggest only doing one or two ruck sessions a week. Feel free to do them on the road, but I prefer trails. You won’t necessarily need to worry about speed; the GoRuck is a team event instead of an individual speed event for time like the Army’s 12 mile road march.</p>
<p>If 25 pound for half an hour was fine, then increase the duration by 15 minutes. **Increase duration before increasing load. **Work towards an hour with 25 pounds, complete it a couple of times, and then increase the weight to 30 to 35 pounds. If the 25 pounds for an hour was hard, reduce the time to 45 minutes when increasing the weight, otherwise repeat 60 minutes. Your goal is to increase the amount you can carry for one hour. It’s not necessary to exceed 50 pounds — your six bricks plus water/food will weigh about 35 pounds during the challenge, and then submerging your packs in water will add another 5 pounds or so. The weight will range between 35 and 45 pounds for a male, so working with anything over 50 pounds isn’t necessary and can be injurious.</p>
<p>Once you have moved your hour-long ruck over 35 pounds, and you have the time and the gumption, you can start pushing into longer movements. Cap the overall duration at 3 hours, but it isn’t necessary to go above 2 hours, especially since you need to lift during the week. I didn’t do anything over 2 hours before the challenge (I did one movement that went 8 miles in 2 hours on flat terrain with the dogs, who slowed me down to take dumps). Whenever you increase the duration, stick with 35 pounds. For the sake of a GoRuck Challenge, you won’t need to do 2 hours with 50 pounds, so just progressively add 15 minute intervals with 35 pounds. If your body feels banged up, just repeat that same session again before progressing.</p>
<p>At most, you’ll handle 50 pounds. At longest, you’ll go 2 to 3 hours. Stick to around 35 pounds for the longer movements. If you are going to ruck twice a week, then do one short, and one longer. You’ll want more rest after a longer movement, so do it on a Friday or Saturday and rest throughout the rest of the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>While Rucking</strong></p>
<p>****Aim to move out with purposeful strides. Meandering like a tourist will be better than nothing, but during the GoRuck your speed can be very slow (when carrying things) or a decently paced run. It’s better to be accustomed to a mall walk. I’ve heard of people getting sore calves from rucking or hiking; don’t aim to “toe off” of the ground, aim to drive your heel back. You want the larger posterior chain muscles to be your motor instead of the smaller calf muscles.</p>
<p>Always bring water. I usually didn’t use it on the hour long movements, but it’s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. Some people have the idea that they will train to plan for lack of water and food, but this is a bad and stupid idea. Don’t put yourself in harm; there’s not really anyway you can prepare for the mental aspect of a GoRuck.</p>
<p>If you’re going for longer movements in the wilderness, then plan accordingly. Snacks, water, flashlight, fire starting capabilities, knife, and gun if you have it. Turn your phone on sleep if so you have battery if necessary and put it in a ziploc bag if rain is on the forecast. Bring a whistle so you can make a bunch of noise if you break a bone and can’t move. When you don’t respect nature, that’s when it’ll bite you in the ass. The same goes for asshole people who may try to take advantage of you or harm you; it’s up to you to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on your feet; they are the most important aspect of rucking. If the feet are blistered, it’ll hinder everything you do. Properly fitted and broken in foot wear is vital. I like to wear boots and have used GI desert boots an infantry friend gave me. They used to chew my feet up decently, but now, without any custom work done on them, they are my most comfortable boot. I have confidence that I can move up to 20 miles without blisters. Note that I purposely wore them in the beginning to toughen my feet. I bought a pair of boots that are similar to the Nike Free boots to use for the GoRuck. They worked splendidly despite my feet being completely wet the entire challenge; I didn’t have any blisters. However, they gave me heel blisters in the first 45 minutes of climbing Ben Lomond, a mountain in the Wasatch Range in northern Utah. I ended up dealing with the blisters for the next 7 hours. Test your foot wear in climbing up hill, going down hill, and on flat terrain. You don’t want your heel to rub on the way up or your toes to smash the toe box on the way down. Most people wore trail running shoes at the challenge and seemed to not have any foot issues.</p>
<p><strong>Lifting Around the Rucking</strong></p>
<p>How to structure the weekly template is most relevant to a trainee. Never train the day after a GoRuck. At best general fatigue will limit the session and at worst you may have lingering joint soreness that is tweaked during the lifting. Always have at least one day of rest after a ruck. For longer movements, take two days of rest. I’ve taken as many as three or four days of rest after long hikes (specifically before an Olympic lifting session).</p>
<p>If you train Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then you can ruck on Saturday. You could also ruck on Wednesday after training. If you rucked on Tuesday or Thursday, then the subsequent training day would need to be modified to be less stressful. There was a point where I did a short/heavy ruck on Thursday, a light lifting session on Friday (barbell rows, weighted pull-ups, and farmer’s walks), followed by a long/light ruck on Saturday. I still lifted on Friday, but I removed any movements that would have been affected by the Thursday rucking. The MWF had a “heavy-medium-light” approach.</p>
<p>If you train Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, then the  best days to ruck would be Tuesday and Saturday. Tuesday’s ruck would be followed by a complete day of rest, and the Saturday morning session will allow the rest of the weekend for rest.</p>
<p>If you only aim to ruck once a week, then Saturday is probably the best option to avoid interfering with your lifting schedule. If you progress it well, as indicated above, then you shouldn’t have any joint or muscular issues. The most likely interference will have to do with limited mobility. Walking with 40 pounds for an hour and then trying to hit a seamless snatch a couple of days later are dichotomous methods of training. Prepare to work on your ankles, calves, knees, hips, and shoulders in preparation of avoiding problems from rucking (future posts will include mobility solutions).</p>
<p>In addition to lifting and rucking, add some calisthenics once or twice a week. If you’re limited on time, just use pull-ups, push-ups, and squats. It’s easy to do a quick “5 rounds of Cindy” after a training session. “Cindy” is a CrossFit workout of doing as many rounds in 20 minutes of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 squats. Don’t worry about 20 minutes, just work on doing timed sessions of 5 to 10 rounds. Add up your total number of reps for a given exercise and make sure this total progresses appropriately. If you up and do 100 pull-ups in a day (dead hang, of course), then you’ll probably have lingering soreness that interferes with pressing, benching, or deadlifting (fatigued shoulder extensors would not help keep the bar against the legs). You’ll end up doing sit-ups and flutter kicks at the challenge, but you’re going to do so many calisthenics beyond fatigue it doesn’t really matter. As long as you have a decent strength, mobility, and endurance (i.e. fitness), you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>**The GoRuck Challenge is supposed to be hard, **especially for a goober civilian who has never walked over ten miles with a load. By adding correctly programmed rucks into the training, you can adequately prepare for the challenge while still maintaining your normal lifting schedule. Getting time under a ruck will make the experience less agonizing and let you be a relevant member of the team instead of shutting down and ignoring the world. The challenge is designed to get harder through the night. By preparing for the event intelligently, you’ll be able to more effectively make a contribution to the team. Especially when the going gets tough. And the cadre will make it GoRuck Tough.</p>
