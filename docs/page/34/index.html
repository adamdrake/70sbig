  <p>_Mondays are devoted to female topics. _</p>
<p>Women are complicated. If the hormone function of a male is complex, then the function of a female is worse than quantum physics. This isn’t a dig on women; it’s just that biochemistry and endocrinology are incredibly dense and not fully understood, and the nature of the female gender makes it even more opaque. Despite all the things we know about life and the human body, there is a still a lot of unknown.</p>

    Biochemistry of the Human Cell: Schematic diagram shows its biochemical/metabolic pathways. Yikes.
  </p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Prescribing drugs and medications has become the norm in modern “health”. A drug may have an effect on one thing, but undoubtedly fiddles with other biochemistry to produce ill side effects. Drugs can work on neurotransmitters, hormones, or hundreds of other functions like enzymatic processes. When going on or off drugs, it can take several months for the body to normalize into a new ‘concept’ of homeostasis. Remember that the “stress/adaptation” process is constantly occurring, and an adaptive stress is basically “the sub-lethal dose, or lack thereof, of something that is different than the currently adapted homeostasis”.</p>
<p>I trained a kid who had hyperthyroid syndrome. He was prescribed propylthiouracil (PTU) to stop the thyroid from making it’s hormone. It’s pretty toxic to the liver, so his dosage was always being modified by his doctor. When it significantly blunted his thyroid, his strength and body weight gains were impressive. When his dosage went down, his strength and weight suffered. However, it took about six weeks or so for the changes to occur after his dosage was changed; the effect wasn’t immediate. This is an extreme example of the body undergoing a significant change, yet taking time to actually have a response.</p>
<p>This same concept can be applied to female trainees and their prescriptions. The most common drug will be some kind of hormonal birth control AKA “the pill”. There are different types of drugs, but they essentially inhibit ovulation and fertilization. These pills usually consist of estrogen and progestin, which are female hormones. **In practice, hormonal birth control seems to have a negative effect on training. **</p>
<p>I’m not going to pretend to know a lot about the exact performance change from a fluctuation of female hormones . In sooth, nobody really does. Yet it’s generally accepted with practitioners that too much estrogen is a bad thing for training females. And when you think about it in simple terms, it makes sense: The female body has adapted to have a certain hormonal fluctuation throughout a month. When that is significantly altered, things will, at the very least, not be as efficient. Gals who take birth control seem to carry more body fat, especially in the hips and legs, aren’t as lean, and seem to make strength gains slower (sleeping problems may be common enough to include here).</p>
<p>Instead of trying to make a definitive statement about birth control and estrogen, I want to do two things. <strong>First, here are some resources I found on the internet about this topic</strong>.</p>
<p>a) <a href="http://robbwolf.com/2012/06/12/estrogen-brad-davidson-episode-136/">Robb Wolf podcast with Brad Davidson</a>. I listened to this a couple of months ago and Brad works with females, especially figure competitors and helps them clear excessive estrogen out of their system to help them lean out for their shows. Since he trains them in the gym, it has an effect on their gains. I’m simplifying, so listen to the podcast to hear what he has to say about it. There seems to be more than one source talking about a) reducing exposure to estrogens and b) clearing them from the system.</p>
<p>b) <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/estrogen/#axzz266H8EABG" target="_blank">Mark’s Daily Apple: Estrogen</a>. Mark’s website is easily my favorite nutrition site. He is a good writer, mixes logic with available research, and is an intelligent hombre. I’m not a perfect writer, but I really appreciate the “good writing” part. I also think Mark is interesting and if I ever chatted with him I’d make fun of his reading choices because JESUS CHRIST THEY ARE BORING. Then we’d do some push-ups on the beach and talk about living until we’re 150 years old (Mark undoubtedly will; I’ll probably get shot before then). Here’s the opening paragraph of this estrogen post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The human endocrine system exists in a state of delicate balance. None of its constituents function in a vacuum, and trying to explain every hormonal interrelationship would take volumes, but one statement is fairly safe to make: one hormone affects another. Secreting one often inhibits the next, which in turn sets off an entirely different chain reaction of hormonal secretions, inhibitions, and syntheses. I almost feel like trying to micromanage your entire endocrine system is tedious and counterproductive (and probably impossible to do effectively). I much prefer to simply <a title="MDA Recipes" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/category/recipes/?submit=view" target="_self">eat right</a>, <a title="Fitness Category" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/category/fitness/?submit=view" target="_self">exercise smart</a>, <a title="Sleep Category" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/category/sleep/?submit=view" target="_self">get good sleep</a>, <a title="Stress Category" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/category/stress/?submit=view" target="_self">normalize stress</a>, and take advantage of simple lifestyle hacks. Still, it doesn’t hurt to understand some of the major hormonal players, especially one as widely maligned by the strength and fitness community as estrogen.</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really don’t need to say anything else; this is exactly what I was going to write for my conclusion.</p>
<p>c) <a href="http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/801/10_Ways_To_Lower_Estrogen_Toxic_Load_.aspx" target="_blank">Charles Poloquin on reducing estrogen</a>. Poloquin talks a lot about this topic and he is referenced in the above Robb Wolf podcast episode. The interesting thing in this article is the mention of phytoestrogens. I’ve seen stuff go back and forth on these — saying they are harmful or helpful — but you can see Poloquin’s take on them.</p>
<p>d) <a href="http://www.paleoforwomen.com/phytoestrogens-estrogens-and-estrogen-receptors/" target="_blank">Speaking of phytoestrogens, this “Paleo for Women” post may shed some more light on them</a>.  I’ve never read this site, but this post had some good basic information that should help you gals. Then there’s <a href="http://www.paleoforwomen.com/the-physiology-of-womens-weight-loss-part-i-estrogen/" target="_blank">this other article from the same site on estrogen and weight loss</a>. Then there’s <a href="http://www.paleoforwomen.com/birth-control-pills-how-they-work-benefits-and-risks/" target="_blank">this detailed and lengthy post about birth control</a>.</p>
<p>I think it’s kind of hard to get a gauge on phytoestrogens and estrogen supplementation since some sources talk about the benefits (<a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/409646-estrogen-supplement-benefits/" target="_blank">on estrogen</a>) and drawbacks (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16898863" target="_blank">on phytoestrogens</a>). And then there’s the issue of birth control itself. In actuality, I agree with Mark above: a low inflammatory diet, low stress, good sleep, and exercising regularly are the keys to creating a healthy and optimal homeostasis regardless of gender.</p>
<p><strong>The second thing I want to do is ask all of the female readers if you or anyone you know takes hormonal birth control and how do you think it affects your training.</strong></p>
<p>Note that some women take birth control because their menstruation periods are incredibly awful and painful. Also note that these same women may be unhealthy, do not exercise, sleep poorly, are constantly stressed, and won’t eat a low inflammatory diet that is high in nutrients and protein. I’d be curious to see if this is what you guys see.</p>
<p>**Invite your friends to comment on this interesting issue. Please comment on a) strength training gains, b) conditioning gains, c) body composition, and d) any other life factors like sleep or stress. **Also note how long it took for you to see a change in your body or body functioning when going on or off the drugs. Maybe we can come to a conclusion that will influence how females structure their training or lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Post your training updates and PR’s to the comments. More importantly, tell us how you are joining the fight for <strong>La Revolución de Pantalones Cortos</strong>! The fight for the right of manliness! (<a href="/blog/2012/09/the-revolutionary-guide-to-manly-short-shorts/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge</strong></p>
<p><a href="/blog/2012/08/qa-40/" target="_blank">Last week’s challenge</a> asked you to “Learn about a specific muscle group that gives you problems in training. Learn how it functions as well as what you can do to improve the problem.” Share your findings in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Next Week’s Challenge:</strong> If you do not own a pair of short shorts and you qualify to participate in <a href="/blog/2012/09/the-revolutionary-guide-to-manly-short-shorts/" target="_blank">The Revolution</a>, then buy a pair. Proudly wear them. Report your experience in next week’s Q&amp;A comments.</p>
<p><strong>Week In Review</strong></p>
<p>Monday was a bullshit government holiday called Labor Day, so there wasn’t a female post. Tuesday was a post about <a href="/blog/2012/09/peds-and-naivety/" target="_blank">Lance Armstrong and PEDs</a>. I started the article by talking about Armstrong because I felt bad, but I think my opinion has changed on him. He’s allegedly a dickhead who still used drugs when he was told not to, and then lied about it. I still think overcoming cancer and fundraising hundreds of million dollars are redeeming qualities, but I guess I’ll file this into the, “He’s a dickhead who does some nice things” category. Wednesday talked about the benefits of foam rolling as part of a warm-up and how using a hard foam is usually better than PVC.</p>
<p>Finally, Thursday, <strong>WE STARTED A REVOLUTION</strong>. Read about <a href="/blog/2012/09/the-revolutionary-guide-to-manly-short-shorts/" target="_blank">The Short Shorts Revolution</a></p>
<p><strong>Story Time</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday in honor of The Revolution, I wore my short black shorts and a black tank top with shoes out into public. This is standard ops for short excursions, yet for longer trips I usually wear shorts with pockets and a belt. I think the site of a guy in short shorts with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-MT10-Minimus-Running/dp/B00966158U" target="_blank">shoes</a> is particularly alarming to the public than a guy in flip-flops. I guess it’s because such a guy made a deliberate decision to go out in that attire instead of just easily throwing on some flip-flops. Make no mistake: you will receive stairs when you do this. Assuming your shorts aren’t dangerously short (to show ass cheek or scrote), ignore these stairs and proudly go about your business. Most of the In-N-Out customers were wearing pants, but their stares didn’t register on my “give a fuck” meter. <strong>Because we’ve got a god damn Revolution to run, that’s why.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello, Justin. I’m currently going through the archives of your website, and it is incredibly informative and inspiring. I am in the middle of linear progression after a bout of fuckaround-itis. I weigh 156 pounds. I am 17 years old. I made a bet that I could become 190 pounds by March 4th. I am eating at least 5 or 6 hamburgers, innumerable bananas, a pound and a half of wild salmon, and half of a chicken every day (I take psyllium husk, creatine, and vitamin-d. Fish oil rarely if I run out of money for salmon for a few days). Please tell me this is not only possible, but with a strong devotion to constantly performing compound lifts, it will be mostly muscle. On a side note, you have convinced me that a belt and shoes are practically necessary tools despite how much lifting barefoot feels badass. But how often do you use the belt? Every time you train? Thank you very much, and sorry if I’m bothering you.</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear ashkanjah, </strong></p>
<p>I’d be pretty impressed if you were eating that much. How much is this bet worth? It’s entirely doable to reach 190 by march; people have gained much more in much less time. I don’t know if you’ve read the recent dietary advice on the site, but it revolves more around a “meat and potatoes” regimen and is modeled after the paleo diet (with the occasional allowed splurge).</p>
<p>That being said, you have two strategies: a) get to 190 ASAP or b) steadily gain quality weight and see where you’re at in the beginning of 2013. In the latter example, if you were, say, 10 or 15 pounds under, you could just do a dirty bulk for a period, hit the 190 weight, collect your winnings, and then clean it up and reduce your body fat.</p>
<p>You have plenty of time before March 4th, so distribute the necessary gain per month and stay consistent with that. Most of all, be sure to train consistently.</p>
<p>As for the belt and shoes question: training efficiently and safely is more important than subjectively feeling like a badass. “Badass” is squatting 500+ pounds weighing 190 pounds, not squatting 250 pounds barefoot at any body weight.</p>
<p>P.S. I, like most people, wear a belt on work sets. I don’t wear one during snatches, but I do when front squatting or clean and jerking. Sometimes I do for rows. Presses, squats, and deadlifts, I’ll wear one.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Hey Justin-</p>
<div>
  I&#8217;ve noticed more so lately that I tend to be extremely quad dominant in my squatting (my FSQ #s are basically equal to BS, primarily HB squatting) and feel like I am having trouble activating the hamstrings on those lifts. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve partially attributed it to some ankle mobility and inability to stay in my heels, do you have any tips for making sure I get the full utility out of the hamstrings in those lifts?
</div>
<div>
  Thanks, Roy
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Dear Roy,&nbsp;</strong>
</div>
<div>
  First, it sounds like your front squat frequency is pretty high relative to your high bar frequency (or you have some technique limitations). I&#8217;d make sure you&#8217;re high bar squatting twice as much as you&#8217;re front squatting. Second, when people use vertical styles of squatting I like to have them put in a heavier posterior chain exercise, and the best for this purpose is the RDL (Good Mornings can&#8217;t be loaded as heavy). While I amusingly get mocked for the high frequency of RDL recommendations, they are extremely beneficial for people that are more in the &#8220;beginner&#8221; stages, as Roy is (I&#8217;ve met him before, he trains at <a href="http://www.crossfiteastdecatur.com/" target="_blank">CF East Decatur</a> with my homie <a href="https://twitter.com/ShanaAlverson" target="_blank">Shana</a>). Third, if you&#8217;re having trouble staying in your heels, then I want to double check that you&#8217;re wearing lifting shoes (I assume so).
</div>
<div>
  Fourth, make sure that you&#8217;re working on your ankle and hip mobility. If you don&#8217;t have the mobility to hit proper positioning, then you won&#8217;t have proper muscle activation. Work on your ankles, anterior hip, and external rotators (ask Shana if you&#8217;re at a loss). Lastly, the two most important fundamental cues for vertical squatting (high bar or front) are &#8220;knees out&#8221; and &#8220;heels&#8221;. If you are not maintaining either of those, then reduce the weight so that you can do so. If you&#8217;re allowing your knees to bow in on the ascent, that&#8217;s not training the musculature correctly and, in the long run, will be worthless. You can also think about keeping your weight on the outer third of your foot &#8212; this cue can help effectively bring in the external rotators and prevent the knees from coming in.

  Hey,<br /> I&#8217;m curious what your thoughts might be regarding pre & post op exercises for a herniated disc surgery. I&#8217;ve got a herniated L5-S1 disc and a bulging L4-L5 disc. I&#8217;ve been working with my chiro for several weeks in the hopes that the herniated disc would start to move back into place, but no such luck. It looks like surgery is unavoidable. It was recommended that I focus on ab and stability work going into the surgery to help lessen the load on my spine coming out of the surgery. Do you have any recommendations for pre and post op ab or stability work that might benefit? This will be my second discectomy, and I don&#8217;t want to do this again. I&#8217;m looking to get my torso as strong as possible to avoid any future disc problems.

  <strong>Dear Jonathan,</strong>
</div>
<div>
  This is a fuzzy topic since it&#8217;s a bit out of my forte and it seems to be a&nbsp;reoccurring&nbsp;issue. Primarily listen to your doctor, because I don&#8217;t have all of your information in front of me. &nbsp;Right away I have two assumptions: a) your mobility is not good and b) your lifting technique is not good. I would start daily mobility work on your anterior hip, external hip rotators, and rotational based mobility. Also hit up any other areas that you know you are lacking in (potentially thoracic spine and ankles); other areas can cause problems whenever you do start to lift or exercise again. If you think your mobility is bad, then it&#8217;s probably very bad, and I would have you work on it twice a day.
</div>
<div>
  As for your lifting technique, you&#8217;re gonna need to find a good coach. If you are not currently lifting (due to the injury), then you can still do some basic stuff like planks, side planks, Pallof presses (google it) and possibly some torso rotations. Even if you do not want to or can&#8217;t squat or deadlift, I would think you could still do light RDLs.
</div>
<div>
  I&#8217;m actually surprised surgery is the only solution. It&#8217;s not uncommon to have disc issues (some folks aren&#8217;t even aware of it) and I&#8217;ve had some people come back from herniated disc, didn&#8217;t have surgery, and squat and deadlift easily over 225&#215;5 (this person was a female). However, that is dependent on quality coaching and proper technique.
</div>
<div>
  As for post-op, do the standard approach of taking it through a full ROM when you can, lightly load it (this would be body weight initially), and then when ready, start with light, properly executed lifts. I can&#8217;t really be more specific without seeing you in person.

  My name is Zach. First off, I&#8217;d like to say that i appreciate your posts, they&#8217;ve helped me out a lot with my training and have granted me a lot of knowledge. I&#8217;m writing to ask for help on a recent issue I&#8217;ve been having with the lateral side of my gastrocnemius. My issue is that in the bottom of my full squat, I&#8217;m experiencing slight pain and numbness in my left calf as I ascend upward. It spreads from the knee down to above the ankle on the lateral side. I don&#8217;t have any pain other than when I&#8217;m in that position. I tried to do some research to the best of my abilities and what i found that described the symptoms the best was intermittent claudication, a peripheral artery disease that is common in runners. This however seems a little intense of a diagnosis, I&#8217;d like to not jump to an extreme conclusion nor be a hypochondriac. Have you had any experience with this problem, or can you think of a simpler diagnosis?
</div>

  Thanks for your time,<br /> Zach P

  <strong>Dear Zach,&nbsp;</strong>
</div>
<div>
  Thanks for the kind words and I&#8217;m glad the site has helped you. Point blank: I don&#8217;t think you have a peripheral arterial disease. You would probably &nbsp;have a host of other symptoms other than &#8220;I have pain down my leg when I squat&#8221;. Instead, this is probably a nerve issue.
</div>
<div>
  The sciatic nerve is the major nerve that travels down the back side of the thigh. It then splits into the tibial and peroneal nerves. The peroneal nerves travels by the lateral head of the gastrocnemius (your indicated area), winds around the head of the fibula (the lateral bone in the shin), and then travels down the leg splitting into superficial and deep nerves on the lateral (outside) part of the shin. It&#8217;s actually hard to get a good picture of this, but <a href="http://www.dontbeasalmon.net/elearning/term1spotters/docs/images/msq8.jpg" target="_blank">this pic shows you</a> how the tibial and peroneal nerves split (this is a pic of the left leg, the split on the left is the peroneal nerve). You can kind of see how it travels down the outside of the shin in <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Nervous_system_diagram.png" target="_blank">this pic</a>.
</div>
<div>
  In any case, when you&#8217;re going into full knee flexion, you&#8217;re probably clamping down on that peroneal nerve and just reverberating pain down your shin. A friend of mine in the Army has a similar thing going on, and he has recently dealt with a lot of sciatica pain (RDLs helped make this go away, by the way). Anyway, my suggestion to both of you is that you should &#8220;mob&#8221; above and below the knee, especially below it. If you have some tight, inflamed, and swollen tissues, knee flexion would press into the tissues which would press onto the nerve to create your pain. The following video is what I recommended to my friend, and it is a good starting point for you:

    Exhibit A
  </p>
</div>
<p>What I’m talking about is <a href="http://youtu.be/O1kW2yYXEeQ?t=50s" target="_blank">drawing a line in the sand</a>. Unchecked aggression. We have a dedicated enemy, a worthy fucking adversary. Men. Women. <em>This</em> is what we’re up against (Exhibit A).</p>
<p>The metrosexual. The skinny guy. The college kid. The hipster. The hippy. They come in many forms, yet they are all the same. And they’re trying to steal America away from us! It’s time to make a stand, and we do that by proudly revealing two meaty, bouldering thighs that emit a testosterone-filled musk that inspire women to savagely claw at your hairy chest, urging you to take them to the promised land.</p>
<p>This is your density.</p>
<p>If we are to make a stand, to show this country that masculinity is not only en vogue, but necessary to teach young children that waify, frail, useless humans are <em>not</em> the future, that children <em>can</em> work hard and have something to show for it, then we must — repeat MUST — reduce the length of our shorts. It is the only way; it is known. (By the way, I don’t know what “en vogue” means, but I think you can take penicillin for it.)</p>
<p>I will teach you the way of the short shorts. I will begin as a leader, but evolve into a member of the resistance, the last chance we have at rescuing the children — THE CHILDREN! Let me show you the way.</p>
<p><strong>What Short Shorts Are Not</strong></p>
<p>As indicated above, evoking masculinity through your short choice does _not _start with khaki. Sure, khaki must inevitably be worn if you are dragged to a quasi-nice house party in the middle of the summer, but my friend Jeremy and his wife can attest to the fact that I showed up to a quiet house party and not only was I the only one not in a collared shirt, I was the only one wearing short shorts and a tank-top. At first I thought, “This is mildly inappropriate, especially since I don’t know these people.” Then I embraced it, because this is our last hurrah in the “I’m A Little Pansy-Man Frontier”.</p>

  <p id="caption-attachment-7718" class="wp-caption-text">
    Exhibit B
  </p>
</div>
<p>And in case you were curious, masculinity is not emitted in the form of rolled up jean shorts, capris, or shorts that have fake paint splattered on them (Exhibit B). GOD DAMN IT, A REAL MAN SPLATTERS HIS OWN PAINT ON A CUTOFF PAIR OF LEVIS THAT HE HAD TO CUT BECAUSE HIS THIGHS GREW TOO FUCKING BIG FROM SQUATTING HIS DICK OFF EVERY WEEK. This, by the way, is the only acceptable reason to own or wear jean shorts. And if you do wear them, for fuck’s sake…put on some underwear.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, short shorts are not a show of style; they are a show of attitude. Keep this in mind when selecting your shorts. I don’t even understand “style” anyway.</p>
<p>The only exception to wearing capri pants is if your name is Arnold Shwarzenegger in the ’70s and you <a href="http://www.fisicoculturismo.org/fotos/albums/arnold-schwarzenegger/fotos_arnold_schwarzenegger_1869.jpg" target="_blank">cut the bottoms of your pants off</a> to remind yourself how skinny your calves are. The only other acceptable reason is if you are a prisoner of war and the enemy is making you wear them to psychologically weaken you. But then you could just rip the bottoms off to make short shorts, and then use the torn pieces to wear a sweet headband.</p>
<p><strong>What Short Shorts Are</strong></p>
<p>Short shorts are a necessary social statement that say, “I’m a man, damn it.” Either that or “Eat shit, skinny guy.” There are several requirements to pulling off the short shorts.</p>
<p>**1. Be muscular. **</p>
<p>This should be a no-brainer, but once we start this bandwagon, everyone is gonna want to join. You can’t make a statement about masculinity when you don’t embody the evolutionary male archetype. That’d be like Martin Luther King, Jr. staging a civil rights sit-in protest as a nerdy white guy. If the line of your thigh from your knees to your hips is straight, then you do not qualify.</p>
<p>Additionally, “muscular” means there is shape to your quads instead of just a fatty log. Clean up your diet and <del>clap dem cheeks</del> let your quads boulder out over each other. The more those striations pop, the more effective your message, especially when you just got done squatting over 4 or 500 pounds.</p>
<p>**2. Don’t be creepy. **</p>
<p>The last thing we want when trying to induce a lustful rage in women and inspire children is to give them the “I’m a creepy uncle” or “no-no” feeling. If you’re pretty fat and hairy, you’re gonna creep them out. Sorry dude, that’s just how it is. Get less fat by cleaning up your diet, and reduce the scare of your hairy-ass thighs by getting them in the sun. A tan/hairy specimen is much better than a pale/hairy one.</p>
<p>This last part is the most important part: trim your pubes. I don’t know where it became cool to not trim certain body hair, but if you don’t trim your groin area, and you inevitably put your foot up on the couch when talking to your nieces, you don’t want your ball hair to protrude out and tickle their noses. Please, think of the children. If you aren’t willing to trim, well, maybe short shorts are not for you.</p>
<p><strong>3. Don’t wear a t-shirt.</strong></p>
<p>Unless you’re doing squad PT, take that ridiculous shirt off. The sun is out, it’s over 70 degrrees (F), and you should enjoy some quality Vitamin D. Go shirtless or bump a sweet tank top. The best tank top I’ve ever seen is this “<a href="/2012/09/558442_479600502052325_1839097900_n.jpg" target="_blank">bear wearing sunglasses</a>” one that my friend Norman has. Note that rocking a tank-top or going shirtless requires the machoism to shine from your upper body too, so hurry up and press over 200, bench over 300, and then do at least 1,000 barbell rows every week.</p>
<p><strong>4. Don’t neglect the hams</strong></p>
<p>One of the worst things you can do for our cause — other than make a child sneeze with your pube hair — is to not develop your hamstrings. We aren’t mirror lifters. So RDL your fucking face off. With, like, a bajillion reps a week.</p>
<p>**5. Have the right shorts. **</p>

  <p id="caption-attachment-7720" class="wp-caption-text">
    Exhibit C
  </p>
</div>
<p>And finally to the equipment section. Some of you may remember the sweet shorts that Arnold Schwarzenegger wore in <em>Pumping Iron</em> (Exhibit C). These were undoubtedly my inspiration.</p>
<p>I don’t know how Arnold came across some used high school football shorts, but he inadvertently set the tone for our social movement. Though I will point out that <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JmpkIMgnzIE/TKpZJ1W4flI/AAAAAAAAlWs/-x6Pwd7h11w/s1600/Arnold's+teen+son+Patrick+shows+off+his+muscular+body+2.jpg" target="_blank">wearing Keds with long socks</a> is a bit out of style. That’ll put you in the “creepy” category, especially if you’re hairy and fat.</p>
<p>When shopping for a pair of shorts, ensure that a) there is a liner inside of them and b) the tip of your dugan is not easily visible when viewing the front of your shorts. The liner will help hold your junk in place, and the “not showing your mushroom tip” will prevent us from being banned from cable television. Oh, and Marine Corps “silkies” made by Soffee will inevitably outline your wang, so steer away from those. And if your dong isn’t outlined, you probably should stop wearing them now that everyone knows it’s _supposed _to be outlined and they’ll just think you have a wee little pee-pee.</p>

  <p id="caption-attachment-7721" class="wp-caption-text">
    Exhibit D
  </p>
</div>
<p>People usually ask where I get my shorts (Exhibit D), and I usually get them on military bases/posts for about $10 a pair. Soffees are pretty cheap on their website, but then you run into that “everyone is drinking in the view of my bone” thing. Feel free to post other brands to the comments, but I highly recommend having a liner in your shorts. The last thing _anyone _needs is an “accidental ballsack discharge” or “peek-a-boo-wiener”.</p>
<p><strong>Fight the Good Fight</strong></p>
<p>Remember, every time you clothe yourself in the morning you make a statement. Do you want that statement to say, “I will conform to how skinny, no-lifting puke-faces are shaping modern society”? Or will you say, “God damn it, I’m a man”? I know some of you have real jobs and can’t show up to work wearing short shorts, but the aforementioned Jeremy routinely shows up to the office wearing multi-colored cowboy boots and a beard. He paves his own way.</p>
<p>We shall take back America!</p>
<p>Join the resistance — WEAR SHORT SHORTS!</p>

  <p>Several years ago foam rolling was the “in” thing and everyone used and praised it. Self “mobility” work has since evolved away from foam rolling — even to the point of poopooing it — but it can still serve a purpose.</p>

<p>Most Tommy Tough Guys will say, “Ptsh, foam rolling is too light, I just use a a PEEH-VEH-CEE.” An actual foam roller won’t correct any real soft tissue problem, but that’s not its effective purpose. Foam rolling is best used prior to activity or training to loosen up the soft tissue (which can include fascia, muscles, or tendons) to be more pliable and allow a comprehensive range of motion (ROM). Think of it as a part of warming up instead of soft tissue treatment.</p>
<p>Trainees lament that a large portion of their day is spent sitting down. And if they’re standing up or doing manual labor, they’re still probably not going through a full ROM and spend time in problematic positions (bending over, crouched down, on knees, etc.). Either way, loosening up the body with a foam roller will prep those structures for activity, whether  applying force maximally or ballistically. This light soft tissue work will augment any movement prep like dynamic stretching or any “mob” that includes positional stretching. Heavy, invasive massages prior to training can have a deleterious effect on performance, yet light massages can make the structures more pliable, increase blood flow to the area, and even reduce Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) quicker.</p>
<p>At worst you’re increasing your warm-up by five to ten minutes. At best you’re enhancing that warm-up, improving recovery, and prepping your structures to train better.</p>
<p>One reason that a PVC may not be as useful in the context of a warm-up is because it’s more invasive and painful. Tommy Tough Guy Mentality says, “I can take it. BRING ON THE PAIN.” Just because you can deal with pain doesn’t mean you’re a) cool or b) doing anything useful. In actuality it’s not easy to undergo pain and completely relax a muscle. The point is to get some light massage through the muscle belly tissue, not to tense up and contract the muscle because it’s experiencing pain and try to massage a taught muscle. By using foam, you can reach deep into the tissue without tensing up or disrupting the cellular environment too much.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that PVC is worthless, but it’s most likely inferior for warm-up purposes for most people. Note that over time your tissues will adapt to the foam roller and you’ll need a harder surface to receive the same effect. That means if you’ve been foam rolling daily for a couple of years, then no, this won’t apply to you. Foam rollers can cost 15 to $20 and PVC can cost a few dollars. I think they both serve a purpose, especially when you don’t have a servant to give you a rub down prior to training (yeah c’mon). In case you’ve haven’t gotten on the internet since 2005, here’s a video of a foam rolling protocol, specifically what I do before training. I aim to loosen tension on my back, hips, and knees. I could probably accomplish the same with a PVC, but I know it’d cause some “tensing up” in my thighs or around my knees. The PVC also crunches on the spinous processes of my vertebral segments when rolling certain positions on my back. If all you need is a light massage, and you have access to a foam roller, then it’s a better tool.</p>

  <p>On <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/lance-armstrong-banned-life-career-vacated-170242581--spt.html" target="_blank">Friday, 24 August 2012</a>, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency erased Lance Armstrong’s 14 year career — including his 7 Tour de France titles — and banned him for life from the sport of cycling. They did this without a shred of physical evidence because Lance allegedly did something that every Tour de France cyclist — <em>every elite athlete</em> — does. That something is use performance enhancement drugs (PEDs).</p>
<p>Lance Armstrong is an American hero. In his early career he was an up-and-coming cyclist who showed flashes by winning the UCI Road World Championship in the pouring rain in Norway in 1993. He also had won the first stage of the Tour de France but had not yet won “The Tour”, the pinnacle of cycling racing.</p>
<p>Then he was diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 25 (October 1996). The cancer had metastasized into his lungs, abdomen, and brain. After emergency surgery to remove his tumor-ridden testicle, he was told he had less than a 40% likelihood of surviving. His final chemotherapy treatment was in December of 1996.</p>
<p>Did Armstrong feel sorry for himself, only to wallow in self-pity? No, he made a decision to get back on the bike and train. He would later win his first Tour de France in 1999, less than three years since he went to the doctor coughing up blood with a swollen testicle. He would go on to miraculously win the next six Tour de France races (for a total of seven), beating every top rival in the world.</p>

<p>And then there were the PEDs allegations. For an exhaustive list and timeline of the allegations, you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Armstrong" target="_blank">read the Wikipedia article</a>. What it amounts to is Armstrong vehemently opposing the idea of using PEDs, various sources claiming he used, and him passing over 20 drug tests in his return to cycling from 2008 to 2009. Yet the frozen urine samples from 1999 allegedly contain erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Armstrong started The Lance Armstrong Foundation that has sold the Livestrong bracelet since 2004. This non-profit has raised over 325 million dollars and is one of the top ten groups funding cancer research along with supporting people afflicted with cancer.</p>
<p>**Lance Armstrong is a respectable, successful, amazing man. And he used performance enhancement drugs. **</p>
<p>There is no hard physical evidence saying that Armstrong has used PEDs and he has never tested positive for them. USADA is a pain-in-the-ass organization that is crucifying him for something that is not only not proven, but something <em>that everybody does</em>. Wake up boys and girls, elite athletes are all “dopers”. That’s the way it has been, that’s the way it is, and that’s the way the future will always be. This doesn’t take anything away from Armstrong’s success because all of his opponents were doing the same thing. However it does take away from his “American Hero” persona because the world is full of naive people who want to believe that everyone is clean and the rules make sense.</p>
<p>Just because something is a rule or a law doesn’t mean it’s right.</p>
<p>Let’s prevent this from turning into a philosophical discussion on how we should derive our rules, laws, and regulations, and focus on this single fact: <em>everyone dopes</em>.</p>
<p>Angel Heredia provided PEDs to elite and Olympic athletes. He supplied them to <a href="/blog/2012/08/a-part-of-me-died/" target="_blank">our friend Maurice Greene</a>, Marion Jones, Justin Gatlin, and Tim Montgomery. He admits to it because the FBI caught him and now he has to tell the truth or he goes to jail for a very long time. He did <a href="http://tt.tennis-warehouse.com/showthread.php?t=412846" target="_blank">this interview</a> with a German magazine in 2008 that was quite revealing. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Mr. Heredia, will you watch the 100 meter final in Beijing?</p>
<p><strong>Heredia:</strong> Of course. But the winner will not be clean. Not even any of the contestants will be clean.</p>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Of eight runners …</p>
<p><strong>Heredia:</strong> … eight will be doped.</p>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> There is no way to prove that.</p>
<p><strong>Heredia:</strong> There is no doubt about it. The difference between 10.0 and 9.7 seconds is the drugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best athletes in the world use drugs. They do it for several reasons, and I bet it’s up to the individual as to which is most important. The first is that it improves their performance, helps them recovery (including from injury), or subsequently helps prevent injury. PEDs do not make a person elite; an elite person becomes cream of the crop by using drugs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Can drugs make anyone into a world record holder?</p>
<p><strong>Heredia:</strong> No, that is a misapprehension: “You take a couple of tablets today and tomorrow you can really fly.” In reality you have to train inconceivably hard, be very talented and have a perfect team of trainers and support staff. And then it is the best drugs that make the difference. It is all a great composition, a symphony. Everything is linked together, do you understand? And drugs have a long-term effect: they ensure that you can recover, that you avoid the catabolic phases. Volleyball on the beach might be healthy, but peak athletics is not healthy. You destroy your body. Marion Jones, for example …</p>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> … five-time Olympic medallist at Sydney 2000 …</p>
<p><strong>Heredia:</strong> … trained with an unparalleled intensity. Drugs protect you from injury. And she triumphed and picked up all the medals.</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reason that PEDs are used is money. Elite athletes have sponsorships. Their success is directly correlated with the flow of money and therefore dictates whether or not they get paid to train. In order to keep their dream alive — the dream of competing and winning at the world level — they will do whatever they can to retain that money. Sometimes their family depends on it. They are full of incentive to train, recover, and perform to the best of their ability. Put yourself in their position: if your wife, kids, and grandparents relied on your money to live comfortably, or you could make enough money to support them for the rest of their lives, would you use PEDs for several years?</p>
<p>The last reason that PEDs are taken is because <em>everyone is using them</em>. Why would you subject yourself to a performance deficit when everyone around you is using PEDs? Glenn Pendlay has been told by junior international weightlifters that they cannot make it to the next level because they aren’t able to take enough “medicine”. Professional baseball and football players are routinely caught and disciplined for using banned substances. And you bet your ass that Olympic athletes are using whatever edge they can get.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing — most of it is untraceable!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Do you have any other secrets?</p>
<p><strong>Heredia:</strong> Oh yes, of course. There are tablets for the kidneys that block the metabolites of steroids, so when athletes give a urine sample, they don’t excrete the metabolites and thus test negative. Or there is an enzyme that slowly consumes proteins – epo has protein structures, and the enzyme thus ensures that the B sample of the doping test has a completely different value than the A sample. Then there are chemicals that you take a couple of hours before the race that prevent acidification in the muscles. Together with epo they are an absolute miracle. I’ve created 20 different drugs that are still undetectable for the doping testers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Angel Heredia doesn’t have a chemistry degree and he’s making undetectable PEDs. There’s a saying that says, “The drugs are always ten years ahead of the testing.” PEDs will not go away. The only way that they can is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Can the testers win this race?</p>
<p><strong>Heredia:</strong> Theoretically yes. If all federations and sponsors and managers and athletes and trainers were all in agreement, if they were to invest all the money that the sport generates and if every athlete were to be tested twice a week – but only then. What’s happening now is laughable. It’s a token. They should save their money – or give it to me. I’ll give it to the orphans of Mexico! There will be doping for as long as there is commercial sports, performance-related shoe contracts and television contracts.</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizations like USADA or WADA lack the ability to do their jobs. They are making some headway by prosecuting people, but they are eliminating athletes — athletes like Lance Armstrong who are literally inspirational heroes — from sports that aggressively use PEDs. They are trying to prove the worth of their organization by publicizing the execution of the big names. It’s all in the name of “fairness” when in reality intelligently using PEDs is something that equalizes fairness across competitors. But it isn’t enough because athletes will always use PEDs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Are there still any clean disciplines?</p>
<p><strong>Heredia:</strong> Track and field, swimming, cross-country skiing and cycling can no longer be saved. Golf? Not clean either. Soccer? Soccer players come to me and say they have to be able to run up and down the touchline without becoming tired, and they have to play every three days. Basketball players take fat burners – amphetamines, ephedrin. Baseball? Haha. Steroids in pre-season, amphetamines during the games. Even archers take downers so that their arm remains steady. Everyone dopes.</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>**If you’re still of the anti-doping mindset, you’re naive. **There are even collegiate and high school athletes who use PEDs. There is no safe sport for you to watch other than 5-year-old T-ball.</p>
<p>For everyone one athlete that is caught, there are probably a hundred, maybe a thousand that get away with using PEDs. We waste congressional time and money trying to track PEDs users down and careers or lives are ruined as a result. “Sport” is a big industry, and it would be much more simple to legalize the use of PEDs and openly allow coaches and athletes to improve the already safe and effective methods of using them (the people who misuse them are idiots working out in your local Gold’s Gym). It would keep the athletes healthier, eliminate an archaic and useless system, and not change the outcome of the world’s sporting events.</p>
<p>But modern society is still stuck in mindset that the world is black and white, good and evil, with these silly regulations and witch hunts. The fact that everyone is using and the drug tests can’t identify any of them would be funny if it weren’t so devastatingly sad when it tarnishes the professional career of someone respectable like Lance Armstrong.</p>

<p>_Note: This is coming from someone who has never used PEDs. _</p>
<p>_Edit: I’ve talked with some people and I have sort of changed my stance on the issue. Do I think Lance is a hero because of his drug use? No. But two things in particular make him admirable: a) the fact that he came back from full body cancer, trained hard as hell, and won the pinnacle of his sport SEVEN TIMES and b) how he has used this experience and fame to raise money to support people with cancer and research. Those are the admirable qualities. _</p>
<p><em>The un-admirable qualities are how he has consistently lied to his fans (and donators) about using PEDs. He undoubtedly did, and lying about it only makes it worse. Lying isn’t good, but it may have been necessary to a) keep himself out of jail, b) keep the donations coming, or c) any other self-preserving quality, which could include preserving the seven wins. In the context that at least 75% of his opponents, if not all of them, are or were using the same drugs, I don’t know if I have a problem with this. It’s a fuzzy topic for me. The moral might be that, “The world isn’t black and white.”</em></p>

<p>****<a href="/blog/2012/08/qa-39/" target="_blank">Last week’s challenge</a> basically said, “How much butter can you eat, punk?” I’m told there are some interesting communities online that pride themselves on their butter consumption. Eating more butter increases the amount of fat calories consumed. High-fat diets, particularly animal fat, promote higher testosterone and hormone productions — fat and cholesterol are the building blocks of hormones, after all. Eating fat also helps improve insulin sensitivity since it will usually be combined with a change in carbohydrate consumption. Greater amounts of animal fat allow for better recovery and bulking, but they also help a lifter get lean by avoiding carb calories as well as avoiding unnecessary fat gain when trying to bulk. Aside from adequate protein, fat consumption is the best method to recover from training and stay lean. My friend Gant always used to say, “Eat protein to maintain or build muscle, eat fat to recover, and only eat enough carbs to fuel your activity level.”</p>
<p>** Next Week’s Challenge:** Learn about a specific muscle group that gives you problems in training. Learn how it functions as well as what you can do to improve the problem. Share your findings in next week’s comments.</p>
<p><strong>Week In Review</strong></p>
<p>On Monday a bunch of people that are sensitive to vegetarians thought that I would give a shit what they had to say when I wrote <a href="/blog/2012/08/vegetarians-are-great/" target="_blank">this piece</a>. There isn’t anything anyone could say to change my mind because a vegetarian will simply not lead as healthy a life as they could, and they certainly won’t be able to reap the benefits of their training. If they thought research on the human body was so comprehensive and correct, then they are free to go and eat whole grains as 75% of their diet for a year and let me know how that goes. QED. On Tuesday I pointed out that rotating your toes forward for the squat is <a href="/blog/2012/08/public-service-announcement-toe-angle/" target="_blank">dependent on having the mobility</a> to do so. Wednesday I started a series that shows a continuum of <a href="/blog/2012/08/learning-about-strength-and-conditioning/" target="_blank">how to learn about strength and conditioning</a>. This particular post was focused on several very good anatomy books; anatomy is the foundation for coaching and programming. I also sent out the first issue of the 70’s Big Insider Newsletter today. Normally these won’t be available to non-subscribers, but today <a href="http://eepurl.com/o4dnD" target="_blank">you can get a view of the newsletter</a> (this preview link will be taken down tomorrow).</p>
<p>**Q&amp;A **</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2012/08/public-service-announcement-toe-angle/comment-page-1/#comment-28105" target="_blank">brian45 asks:</a></p>
<p>this is siituational (not me, just hypothetical). What I am trying to say/ask is:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>if a client/person is squatting at say 45 degrees or greater but it is comfortable versus turning their toes into 30 where it is discomforting. Do you A) stop squatting (because the toe angle is so great despite no pain) and focus on mobility until they can move in? or B) hit mobility and using the short term change created have them slightly move in and squat (gradually working in)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Dear brian45,</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t expect someone to be uncomfortable at 30 degrees. Even the most inflexible people won’t need to point their 45 degrees out — it’s pretty excessive. But you are correct in saying that we would not want the person to be uncomfortable from a joint perspective (though they’ll probably be muscularly uncomfortable since squats are not the same as couch lounging). Use the toe angle that is “forward enough” without providing positional or joint complications.</p>
<p>Note that acute applications of ‘mobility work’ can improve positioning for that session. By using joint distraction to open the hip flexors (band pulls thigh forward when kneeling), lacrosse balling the external rotators, and stretching the calves and achilles a lifter can hit better squatting positions. These areas should be worked on regularly too, but it’s immensely helpful to do them immediately before squatting.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>after my acl surgery and partial lateral meniscoctomy, toes forward is very painful. feels like bone one bone action. i probably should just stop trying…</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>To which I replied:</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, man, I wouldn’t attempt it. Perhaps you could hit a different end ROM after a while, but it depends on how the repair was done. The ACL resists anterior translation (the tibia shearing forward) as well as medial rotation. That second part is the important part.</p>
<p>I haven’t wrapped my head around it yet, but when you squat with toes forward the tibia laterally rotates. The ACL is supposed to stop medial rotation, that would produce tension on the ligament. Lateral rotation on the tibia might compress the ligament. That might be the painful part since it’s surgically repaired and no longer normal. Perhaps the repaired tissue is getting pushed into itself, or maybe it’s getting compressed into bone.</p>
<p>Either way, you are right in thinking that you shouldn’t point the toes forward. Maybe forever, but at least for several months.</p>

<p>I’d like to know how gorillas get so jacked from a mostly vegetarian diet. Do they produce significantly more testosterone than humans or what?</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear Daniel,</strong></p>
<p>This is an excellent question. A google search of “how are gorillas so muscular” brought up interesting results. One person noted that a gorilla will eat an average of 18kg of food a day. Plus, they’re grass-fed brah.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it’s due to their fecal consumption.</p>

<p>I am transitioning to TM next week. My starting VD weight is about 65lbs less than my ID weight starting out. Should I advance the VD weight each week for awhile or leave it steady for a few weeks and raise it once per month?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear Brandon,</strong></p>
<p>Do you have <a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Advanced</a>? In that book, it talks about the discrepancy between the Volume Day and Intensity Days as a percentage instead of an absolute amount of weight. It’s hard for me to comment on your situation because you didn’t list your poundages, but ideally someone in your position will wait until his Intensity Day gets a a bit difficult before increasing the Volume Day regularly. Think of the VD as approaching “once every three weeks”, which is the recommendation in <a href="/books/the-texas-method-part-1/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Part 1</a>. I’ll also point out that the first book has a process for transitioning into the TM, and it’s dependent on what your previous program was.</p>
<p>Well, there weren’t a lot of training questions because people were just whining and bitching about various things. Enjoy the first weekend of college football and get outside before the cold season.</p>

  <p>I’ve been asked several times, “What books do you recommend for coaching and lifting?” A coach has a duty to continuously learn and improve. In all likelihood, that means a coach will amend or modify recommendations over time. I know that I can look back two, four, or six years and wish I could go back and re-program trainees differently. Clint Darden does an excellent job explaining this concept in <a href="http://youtu.be/nSXsJzz7e6g" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to absorb information is to meet and talk with as many coaches as possible. It may even be someone that is, objectively, not as good of a coach as you, but you can still collect ideas or methods from them. As for the coaches that are better or more successful, you don’t have to accept everything they say as gospel, but there are always things you can learn even if they practice a different methodology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it’s not possible to badger various people with questions. They don’t have that kind of availability and their time is valuable. The next best way to learn and get better is to read and study. This isn’t confined to training related resources; I’ve pulled coaching lessons out of communications, leadership, and history books. Read as much as you can from as many training methodologies as you can. If possible, read different sources about the same topic.</p>
<p>Keep an open mind about everything and be wary to fully commit to one person’s ideals. Unfortunately for me, that applies to me as well. My “style” or “methodology” is to adapt to what the individual needs. I could use a “CrossFitty approach” that has a lot of conditioning, a standard strength linear progression approach, an Olympic weightlifting focused approach, or a combination of all of them. Despite the fact that I don’t pump one method or program over another for the majority of situations and don’t subscribe exclusively to a single methodology, I am still not the gospel. I try to have a level view of everything and pick and choose based on what a person or group wants or needs, but you should still look to others for knowledge. Most of you do anyway, but I hope it helps everyone become a student of ‘strength and conditioning’ as a whole instead one coach’s disciple.</p>
<p>That being said, the best way to solidify a foundation in strength and conditioning knowledge is by starting with anatomy and physiology. The continuum of knowledge would look like this:</p>
<p>– Anatomy</p>
<p>– Physiology</p>
<p>– Biomechanics</p>
<p>– Classic Strength Training</p>
<p>– Endurance Training</p>
<p>– Mobility Training</p>
<p>– Sport/Exercise Psychology</p>
<p>– Advanced Classic Strength Training</p>
<p>– Advanced Endurance Training (specifically with a high intensity focus)</p>
<p>– Advanced Mobility Training (prehab/rehab, corrective maintenance, soft tissue work, etc.)</p>
<p>– Modern Advanced Strength Training</p>
<p>This starts with the fundamental properties of the body and gradually increases the knowledge base. It also prevents an unnecessary focus on the more advanced stuff before the basics are understood. For example, a trainee should understand how a beginner strength training protocol works — on the programmatic and phsyiological level — before worrying about comprehending the Westside Method. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to read and understand the Conjugate Method from Russian translations too. If a trainee, lifter, or coach doesn’t understand the concept of stress, recovery, and adaptation within the context of physiology, then he has no model to base programming on.</p>
<p>As a side note, I would love to teach classes on each one of these topics. Nerd boners galore.</p>
<p>The core of strength and conditioning lies with anatomy. The way to start learning anatomy is to hold a bone in your hand, feel it, and start learning its landmarks. Bones are always taught first, because if you know the attachment sites of the muscles, then the concept of how muscles work makes learning about muscles easier. It’s daunting at first, though. I can pick up an ulna and orient it to how it would fit into a forearm, but when I first touched an ulna I didn’t even know what it is. And it’s even harder if you’re not in a university class, because you won’t have a model to hold.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important for you to use very good anatomy books to assist your coaching or training ability. Here are three anatomy books that I deem mandatory:</p>
<p><a href="/2012/04/76910866.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6728" data-permalink="/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/attachment/76910866/" data-orig-file="/2012/04/76910866.jpg" data-orig-size="185,231" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="76910866" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/04/76910866-160x200.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/04/76910866.jpg" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6728" title="76910866" src="/2012/04/76910866.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="231" srcset="/2012/04/76910866.jpg 185w, /2012/04/76910866-120x150.jpg 120w, /2012/04/76910866-160x200.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px" /></a><strong>1. _Trail Guide to the Body, 3rd Ed. (or 4th) _by Andrew Biel</strong></p>
<p>I carry this book everywhere. It’s with me at every seminar, and I even had it at the USAPL Raw National meet. There is no other book that has as clear, distinct, and well drawn pictures of musculoskeletal anatomy. Some people say Netter’s or Gray’s work is the best, but they pale in comparison to this book.</p>
<p>It’s made for physical and massage therapists, so the reader is taught how to palpate every structure in the book. This is immensely important because you can learn where these structures lie underneath your skin. It helps in diagnosing injury, learning how to rehab a muscle, seeing the action of muscles, and even what muscles are included in a given movement. Combine this with some basic understanding of musculoskeletal biomechanics, and you can analyze movement.</p>
<p>There’s really no excuse not to have this book. The 3rd Edition is available online for as low as $15 (the newer 4th Edition is a standard textbook price).</p>

<p>Yes, Dr. Kilgore is a friend. Yes, this book is partially full of pictures of me (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/kmPYT.jpg" target="_blank">this picture is the best</a>). No, these two facts do not have any bearing on my recommendation. Kilgore isn’t a pretender. He has augmented the careers of countless people and consistently works towards a life-long goal of improving knowledge in the world of fitness. This book is the culmination of years of thought and teaching lessons that Kilgore synthesized for the purpose of teaching fitness professionals applied anatomy.</p>
<p>I am actually re-reading this book right for my daily “anatomy study” block; it’s a refresher, reminds me of forgotten lessons, and even is teaching me some new ones. The best part about the book is that Kilgore always brings the lesson into an applied format and avoids the conventional fitness trash that we usually see. Squatting, pressing, benching, and deadlifting are the examples instead of isolation movements and bosu balls. This is functional anatomy the way it should have always been. If I were a professor, this would be one of my text books (along with <em>The Trail Guide to the Body</em>).</p>

<p>This book has direct and indirect utility. Directly, it teaches you about muscular anatomy and how tightness in muscles or muscle systems can revert pain at another location. This can help you learn how muscle is integrated throughout the body instead of thinking about them working in isolation. Indirectly it is providing more repetition with (primarily) muscular anatomy. This will only help the S&amp;C student learn about the body, but it will also teach them how to work on soft tissue.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that the authors are obsessed with the “trigger point concept” that muscles have triggers that make them feel better. Instead, think in terms of tension. If there is a lot of tension on the quadriceps (due to their shortening from prolonged sitting, for example), then that would provide tension at the hip and cause pain in the hip or lower back. By using basic massage techniques, it’s possible to alleviate that tension and either reduce the pain immediately or over time. If we combine these soft tissue techniques with positional stretching and joint distraction, we can reduce a lot of pain, prevent injury, and improve mechanics in training.</p>
<p>This book will help with the basic anatomy stuff, but it provides very good information on what actions injure particular muscles and how to treat them.</p>

<p>**In future posts I’ll point out books that can help coaches or curious trainees improve their knowledge. In the mean time, get to reading and studying **</p>

  <p>I wrote a post and filmed a video explaining “<a href="/blog/2012/03/hip-torque-toe-angle-and-squatting/" target="_blank">Hip torque, toe angle, and squatting</a>” to explain why a more forward toe angle in the squat was beneficial. It helps distribute force across the front and back of the thighs more efficiently which results in more muscular applying force to aid the movement. I followed this with another post and video titled “<a href="/blog/2012/03/should-i-point-my-toes-forward/" target="_blank">Should I point my toes forward</a>?” The TL;DR on this second post was, “If you do not have the mobility to point the toes forward, then don’t do it.”</p>
<p>Not only are there people squatting with their toes forward — when I deliberately told them not to do so — these same people are getting tweaks in their knee and don’t know why. The sum of the “why?” is that they don’t have the mobility to do it and aren’t listening to Justin.</p>
<p>This is a public service announcement saying, again: Do <em>not</em> point your toes forward unless you have the mobility to do it. I created the following video that explains what occurs anatomically to cause a strain or tweak in the knee if someone ignores this advice. I also provide a method to quantify the amount of mobility a person should have before pointing their toes forward on a loaded squat (hint: it’s doing the “paleo” squat barefoot, toes forward, and knees out without pain or falling over). I also provide some “mobs”, specifically soft tissue work, that can help relieve tension in that area to improve the mobility to eventually shift the toes more forward. It would have been to difficult to explain this stuff via text, and a video is much easier. I’ve split the video into two parts, because the anatomical portion is a bit long by necessity.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jau1yKl4K9Q" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Note that the popliteus gets strained because it isn’t extensible enough to handle the torque associated with the toes forward position. Also note that repetitive stress on the back of the knee from road marching, rucking, hiking, or high frequency or volume CrossFit movements can beat the structure down. If you try and apply torque on a crusty structure that is in a recovery deficit, then this is another reason why tweaks can occur on the back or side of the knee when doing knees forward squatting. If the structure is beat up, then give it more days of rest than you usually would before returning to squatting.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kWrWzzqRl5o" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Will everyone be able to squat with a toe angle of right outside of forward? No. Can most people improve their mobility to move their toe angle a little bit in from where it is now? Probably. Watch the videos and learn the reasoning that explains why shifting them forward too soon can result in a strain the popliteus (on the back or outside of the knee). This next video provides</p>
