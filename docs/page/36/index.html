  <p>Last year I tried to have a variety of leagues linked to each other, and ended up failing miserably (i.e. it didn’t happen). The result was just a single ten-member league that was okay. It’ll be better this year (because people who didn’t check the team will be kicked out).</p>
<p>There were at least 40 people interested in fantasy football last year. This year, we’ll make it more accessible to you guys. We’ll have at least five leagues.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The main league that features regular readers/contributors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Northeast Division</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>East Coast Division</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>West Coast Division</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Central Division</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are interested in becoming the league manager for your region’s division, post in the comments here (or on Facebook or Twitter). We need people who will actually participate and actively run the leagues. If there are tons more people interested, then we can increase the number of leagues. Note that the leagues won’t be competing against each other, but it’ll just be neat to see readers competing against each other. We <em>could</em> take all of the winners of each league and total their points or other data against each other for a final ranking. At the very least, league winners will get something neat like a t-shirt or book.</p>
<p>The only mandatory “rules” are that the leagues will be hosted on ESPN with 10 members and standard scoring (it’ll keep it consistent). Each league needs the name “70’s Big – X Division”.</p>
<p>So, if you’re interested in hosting one of the regional leagues, comment here or on the social media. We also will need at least two or three members in the main league (maybe more). Note that admission to the main league is dependent on whether or not you’re a) regularly commenting on the site and b) actually a football fan who will check his team every week.</p>

  <p>**PR Friday **</p>
<p>Post your training updates and PRs to the comments IF YOU KNOW WHAT’S GOOD FOR YA.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The challenge <a href="/blog/2012/07/qa-36/" target="_blank">from two weeks ago</a> was “Curl 40kg or 90 pounds for as many reps as possible at the end of one of your training sessions next week.” I did 15 and filmed it in case you goons were to get all aggro.</p>
<p><strong>Next Week’s Challenge:</strong> Do a max set of push-ups at the end of each training session. Perform the reps without stopping (so no resting in the plank position). Wait 20 seconds and do a second max set without ceasing movement. Record your reps and post them in next week’s PR Friday post.</p>
<p><strong>Week In Review</strong></p>
<p>It was a short week due to travelling back from USAPL Raw Nationals. You can see meet recaps for the lifters in <a href="/blog/2012/08/2012-usapl-raw-nationals/" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="/blog/2012/08/2012-usapl-raw-nationals-part-2/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, followed by the <a href="/blog/2012/08/lessons-learned-from-raw-nationals/" target="_blank">lessons learned</a>. The goal as a lifter or a coach is to always get better, so analysis and discussion is important.</p>
<p>Here is the awesome collage video AC made of the meet. Thanks to Elliot Rowe for doing a lot of the filming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Justin,</p>
<p>First off I’d like to say thanks for everything you do with your 70sbig.com webpage. You and your webpage were largely responsible for getting me involved with powerlifting and attending my first meet about a year ago.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve recently been struggling with a snapping hip in my right hip, and just overall hip tightness/pain in the outside of both of my hips. The snapping hip occurs when I move from a toes pointing forward position to a toes pointing outward position. After digging around on your webpage for a bit, I think I may be pointing my toes out too much during my squat in order to compensate for a lack of mobility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, my job requires me to be at a desk for several hours a day, which I’m sure isn’t helping anything. I’ve been doing several hip stretches at least once a day for a few weeks now with no significant improvement on the snapping hip or the general exterior hip pain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just for clarification, I do low bar squat with a stance ~6″ wider than shoulder width, and I do sumo style deadlifts with my toes pointed pretty far out as well.</p>
<p>I’d like to get your thoughts/suggestions on how to alleviate my snapping hip and exterior hip tightness/pain, and improve my mobility so I can move my toes to a more forward pointing position</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any input is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Dear Sean,</p>
<p>These questions are on the borderline with how much I can help. I have some PT friends that will add their two cents in the comments if they have time. In the mean time, I’d be curious to know if you are just having pain, or the actual “snapping hip” type pain where you feel a tendon roll over one of the femur’s trochanter (depending on whether it’s lateral or medial). You have two considerations: a) treat the symptoms of the existing pain and b) address the problems that are causing this to begin with (which are probably mobility and mechanical in nature).</p>
<p>You note that you sit a lot at work. Immediately I think of hip flexor tightness and dysfunction (this would include the psoas, which would be a part of the medial hip snapping stuff). Then you provide the video of your wide stance squat, the kind that is going to put plenty of stress on the hips, and I’m not surprised you’re having an issue. If I were coaching you, I would bitch at you about your shoe choice (we’ll ignore it for now), but I’d bring your stance in and teach you how to squat with more efficient mechanics. You’re going to improve the effectiveness of the hip external rotation and distribute force application across your thigh better when you do. It’s likely that you’ll be weaker in this new position since you have been training the old and wide way for a while. I’d tell you to suck it up, because what you have been doing got you into this current predicament.</p>
<p>As for your deadlift, I’d go ahead and have you pull conventional, at least temporarily. I’d assume you feel the hip pain during the sumo, but pull conventionally for a few months so that you can treat the symptoms. You can go back to sumo down the road, and the conventional work will only augment or compliment your sumo strength.</p>
<p>As for rehabbing the area, that’s almost out of my forte. Apparently the bursa sacs can get irritated with this hip snapping stuff, so I would do things to reduce inflammation as well as work on opening your chronically tight hip flexors. If you feel pulling — in a bad way — on the afflicted area when hitting the hip flexor stretches, avoid them for a day or so. Use movement to heal. Don’t be afraid of isolation exercises and body weight squats (with the new, narrow stance). Point your toes at 20 to 30 degrees and put your heels at shoulder width. If the pain is bad, this could take a month or two to start going away. I’d also try wrapping an ace bandage around your proximal hip (meaning it would be right up by your nut sack) and doing squat reps while wrapped. Be diligent with rehab work, and yes, I’d still ice it after the cessation of activity. Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hope all is well. Spent some time watching Olympic lifting over the last two weeks, noticed how incredibly fat some of those guys are…. beyond that I noticed how incredibly good so many of the lifters are at standing up for the bottom of the hole when it seems like there is no chance they will. Do you have any tips for practicing that pop at the bottom? I find that on heavy squats my ascent involves saying a prayer and hoping my diaper holds up.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Roy</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Roy,</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s interesting how some lifters can be quite lean while other lifters carry a bit of body fat. As for their ability to recover out of the hole, well, that’s what they do every day. Remember that their max squat, front squat, or clean is going to be greater than their best snatch or clean and jerk (some folks will get near their max clean or front squat on the platform). Continue getting stronger and do the Olympic lifts, and you too will get to a point where your average snatch or clean will be easier to recover from.</p>
<p>If you’re high bar squatting, once a week you could “bottom out” your squats where you’ll lower down as far as your mobility allows (i.e. don’t collapse your back or hips). If you have decent mobility, you should be able to touch your hamstrings to your calves. Note that you should use less weight in this lift at first, but it will get you familiar with “bottoming out” a squat, which is common in heavier snatches or cleans. I’d still squat to regular depth throughout the rest of the week. This lift could even be done as back off work when you squat. Overall, just get strong in the back/front squat, snatch, and clean, and you’ll recover better.</p>

  Hey Justin,
</div>
<div>
  On again off again reader of the blog.  37 y/o 5&#8217;11 225ish.  Lifting steadily since I was 14.  Moved away from boring gym routines several years back and got a bit into crossfit.  Had fun on my own with it but never had the cash to join.  I like the intensity it offered and I like how it made me feel like I was working out again rather then spending a half hour isolating my outer delts or whatever the hell I used to do.  Lately a mix of metacon workouts and 5&#215;5 work days.  Just maintaining.
</div>
<div>
  A few years back I noticed I had some nagging pain in my hip that wasn&#8217;t getting better.  Trouble touching my toe, couldn&#8217;t run anymore, trouble squatting.  Real flexibility issues.  Finally get to a doctor and it turns out its pretty bad arthritis.  As in, I need a new hip.  Still going to the gym and lifting because I will have all new hardware in the winter so I may as well get the most usage out of the old one while I can.  Just can&#8217;t do certain lifts because it hurts too much.
</div>
<div>
  So my question for you is, what do you recommend I do and don&#8217;t do with the new hip?  The surgeon, when I asked jokingly said I could do anything but 500lb deep squats. Have you worked with anyone that&#8217;s had a replacement?  Or maybe there are some older lifters out there that have been through it.  Would love to hear your thoughts, as I haven&#8217;t found many real answers from a doctor or form google searching.
</div>
<div>
  Thanks in advance.  And feel free to post this question to the blog if you wan&#8217;t but I don&#8217;t know that it applies to too many readers.

  Dear Matt,

<div>
  Ehhhh. I guess the first thing is if it were me, I&#8217;d want to make pretty damn sure I needed this new hip. But it sounds like you&#8217;re pulling that trigger. I knew a guy that had two full knee replacements and trained on it for a while. Joint replacements are very good these days, but I&#8217;m not sure how to go about training on them. Without consulting friends who are smarter than me, I&#8217;d say just start with very light activity and progress into it, and ensure that your mechanics are absolutely solid. If your mechanics waver, I wouldn&#8217;t increase the load. I&#8217;d be hesitant to have ballistic loading at first and would slowly progress into that. I would use squats and deadlifts, but I wouldn&#8217;t worry about going heavy in them. Use them for what they are: great, compound movements that have a positive effect on metabolism, lean body mass, and strength. I&#8217;ll see if any PT friends want to share their thoughts.

<p>Justin,</p>
<p>In the last month or two, I have had some recurring pain in two places that won’t seem to stay away no matter what I do. One is on my left hip, I guess in the hip flexor area, it hurts most when coming up from squatting, or standing up from sitting in a chair. Also the side of that hip and butt (sciatic?) is tender, so maybe some expressed pain from the hip flexor. I have done the wall stretch to try and loosen it, but it doesn’t seem to go away. I have also sat on an LAX ball to try and loosen the sciatic area, I’ve done foam roller on the quads but that isn’t particularly sore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, my right ankle was swollen for a few weeks, I think I tweaked it trying to do a more toes forward squat stance because there were times I could feel a tendon(?) sliding over a surface. I finished a workout about a month ago with some 50M sprints and that is when the swelling started. It is not swollen anymore, but my ankle is pretty sore when squatting to where I don’t have much drive out of the bottom. I have been doing some compression band stuff with it, but it is on the outside bottom of the ankle bone, not a high ankle sprain area. I also noticed recently that my mid-calf is pretty tight and have been trying to do LAX ball work on that or general release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I went to a chiro who just quickly took me through some stuff with the ankle, iced it and put the TENS unit on it. I asked him about the hip and he did a test and said my hips were out of alignment. But he didn’t offer much more than that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Frustrating as hell, I feel like I should stop squatting in order to let it repair, but I don’t want to lose strength. I am ok on lighter weights, but anything close to my work sets is bad enough that I don’t feel like continuing in the movements. Should I keep working on Mobility for those two areas and just stick to lighter squats. Or drop squats altogether doing some RDLs and Leg Press in the interim.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Craig</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear Craig,</p>
<p>Holy SHIT are you guys asking a bunch of complicated questions today. This question doesn’t provide complete information to be extremely specific and I’ll also see if the PT friends want to take a stab at it.</p>
<p>First off, I’d think your ankle got sore from the sprints, not the squatting toe angle. If you weren’t adapted to full speed pounding (and if you tweaked it), then that’s why the ankle swelled up. Why the hell didn’t the chiro adjust your hips when he said they were out of alignment? Isn’t that his fucking job? That pisses me off a little bit, though there may be circumstances I’m not privy to.</p>
<p>Secondly, everyone should keep in mind that <strong>toes forward squatting is dependent on good mobility</strong>. I don’t know if you actually tweaked your ankle because of this, but I’ve heard of several people tweaking something (though it’s usually in the knee) as a result of trying toes forward. **When you make changes in your stance, do them incrementally over time. **</p>
<p>Third, your ankle/calf itself. “Outside bottom of ankle bone” is vauge — is this your lateral malleolus? Your peroneal tendons will pass right under the lateral malleolus, so you could probably start working on them with soft tissue work. They are on the <a href="http://www.proprofs.com/flashcards/upload/a1145346.jpg">outside of your lower leg</a>. If you work on them, it could release tension under the malleolus. You can also work on your foot arches with a lacrosse ball, especially near the peroneal tendons and anterior (right in front of) the calcaneus (heel bone). I like the idea of wrapping the ankle with physio tape and doing plantar flexion, dorsi flexion, inversion, eversion, and just ankle circles. Don’t do it longer than 2 minutes and try to have it closer to 1 minute. Go ahead and do <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-drills/" target="_blank">foot drills</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/_ZEjCDI1otM" target="_blank">band rehab</a>. Yes, I’d still ice after the cessation of rehab.</p>
<p>Fourth, your hip. It sounds like you have scar tissue on your hip flexor and your lateral hip is tight. I don’t know if it’s sciatic related because if it was, I’d expect some referred pain down the nerve. I also don’t know that mashing on it randomly is going to help. I really can’t help with this as much because the location is vague and you haven’t given me any movements that cause pain. I would need more information, but generally speaking, I’d have some sort of soft tissue work (pin pointed massage), followed by stretching (if applicable), followed by movement (as rehab), followed by one bout of icing.</p>
<p>I’m still talking with people about the whole “icing issue”, and I’m sure that they will have some better input than me. <strong>Just remember that if you want specific help, you have to get specific with where the pain is, when and how does it hurt, and how long it has done so.</strong> More information is much better than none.</p>
<p> </p>

  <p>I’m often asked when my next competition will be. I love competing in lifting, and I will always lift throughout my life, but right now I’m not committed to competing in lifting. Other things like hobbies, writing, running a business (I run all facets of my business, albeit poorly), and coaching get in the way of entering a meet or competition. Until you’ve traveled for almost two months straight and only get to train several times or pull 12 hour days to write a book, you won’t understand that. It used to bother me that I wasn’t a top weightlifter or powerlifter, but I’ve come to accept it and not worry about it. But I think people forget — and I sometimes do too — that I compete all of the time.</p>

    I get huge spikes of adrenaline when Chris, my former training partner, lifts
  </p>
</div>
<p>This past weekend I coached 11 lifters; I competed 11 times. Those lifters had 99 attempts; I competed 99 times. Each of those lifters had warm-ups, psychological factors, and physical variables that had to be accounted for. I don’t merely count attempts and push them to the platform; I try to manage their life. It may be that what I do doesn’t have as much of an effect as I think it does, and it may be that the lifter doesn’t ever notice what I do, but I’m constantly evaluating them and making decisions on their behalf to perform optimally and get the most out of what they can do on that day. I competed all weekend.</p>
<p>For me, coaching is competing. I get adrenaline spikes for each lift, and they are higher than any psyche up I’ve had in my own lifting in at least a year. The difference is that I have to stay in the moment and try to minimize error. In 2010 when Chris missed his last deadlift, I literally took a walk and cried because I was so spent physically and emotionally from coaching. Pretty dorky. Nowadays, I do that three days in a row with more than twice as many lifters. Someone asked me why I opted to handle so many people. I don’t get to sleep, I don’t get to eat, and I really don’t get to hang out with my friends. The only conclusion I can come up with is because it’s a challenge, it’s a competition. That’s the <strong>first lesson</strong>.</p>
<p>There were ups and downs over the weekend. My philosophy as an athlete and a coach has always been, “Let’s find out what went wrong, then figure out what we need to do to fix it.” Remember our lifters from the meet recap (<a href="/blog/2012/08/2012-usapl-raw-nationals/" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="/blog/2012/08/2012-usapl-raw-nationals-part-2/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>): Courtney, Wendy, Brent, Sean, Jordan, Andrew, AC, Norman, Drew, Mike, and Chris.</p>

<p>Raw Nationals is a big meet, and it’s run differently than local competitions. If you’ve never been to one, you won’t really understand how it’s different. In truth, it’s still a powerlifting meet, but it’s the human psyche that builds it up to more than it is. And even if you think you are immune to it, you will fall victim to the fact that it’s not the same as your local USAPL meet. Here’s why.</p>
<p>You traveled to the meet. If you get on an airplane to go compete, you are automatically at a deficiency from what you normally are at home. It’s because you had to go to the airport, dick around in security, sit down on a plane for a while, and eat shitty food. If you’re traveling by air, then you are staying in a hotel for at least one night and your food intake is inherently different than when you’re at home.</p>
<p>You cut for the meet. If you are still relatively new to cutting for a meet (fewer than five times), then this process will be debilitating, even if it’s only a few pounds. It may be that you are slightly physically weaker due to losing weight. But it’s more likely that you have stressed about making weight, even marginally. People freak out about cutting weight. Even Mike still gets worried; he debated not eating or drinking after 4 PM the night before, I told him not to do that and he still weighed in 1kg/2.2lbs under. The stress of making weight, the unknown, is enough to reduce the ability of a lifter, especially when that lifter is less experienced.</p>
<p>It’s a national meet. Especially your first national meet. Especially if you’re still inexperienced (it was the second meet for several lifters). Automatically most people will be over zealous. They’ll be nervous during weigh-ins, getting their rack heights, and warm-ups. They don’t understand that because of all of these things, but especially because it’s a national meet, they are not going to hit the high end weights that they want to. It’s not that nationals are stressful, it’s that in the back of the lifter’s mind, they know they are going to and at a national meet. That little bit of nervousness or stress is enough that physically and psychologically drains them. This is easily treated with some psychological tactics; I implement these tactics with the regular lifters (but it leaves the scope of this post). I had one lifter tell me that it wasn’t a big deal. I’d like to think it’s because I did my job of keeping them calm (which I was actively doing at all times), but the more experienced people are with competition in general, the less phased they will be from big competitions. There’s no substitute for experience, even if it’s another sport.</p>
<p>All of this means that a lifter should adjust their goals to account for being at a national meet, traveling across the country, and/or cutting weight. A lot of powerlifting mentality comes from geared lifting, and raw lifting is a bit different. First attempts probably need to be lower, and third attempt aspirations need to be lower. Shit, even Chris wanted to deadlift 15lbs more than what he actually did. Wendy opened with a 303 squat and it took her until her 3rd attempt to get a good lift. She only had to jump in the car for a few hours of travel but the fact that it was a national meet, albeit her second one, was still a factor. <strong>Accept being conservative</strong> at a national meet. Gym PRs are <em>not</em> meet PRs. If you meet PR at a national meet, that is very good.</p>
<p><strong>Third Lesson — Prevent A Weigh-in Fiasco</strong></p>
<p>****As a lifter, make sure all of your information is correct. As a coach, triple check this. Andrew wanted to open on squat at 200kg. Whether the judge heard him wrong, or he said it wrong, 220kg was written on the card. Then he signed it. I wasn’t present because I went to eat breakfast, but I still felt responsible (I had already briefed him on what to do and gave him a piece of paper with his openers). I could have rectified this by triple checking his opener on the board, but I didn’t. I sure as fuck will forever in the future.</p>
<p>Also, Chris’ second bench was set for 611. Brad Gillingham, Chris’ hero, came up to him and said, “Hey man, are you actually opening with 611 on bench?” Chris said, “Yeah…nah, I’m just kidding. They put it up wrong.” In this case, it was correct on the attempt card but put into the computer wrong (it was his squat opener).</p>
<p>Also, double check equipment before and after the equipment check-in. This is not exactly our fault, but AC’s socks were cleared at equipment check-in and on his first attempt (there’s a judge that stands there specifically to check the attire of the lifter and they will notify you if anything is amiss). On the second attempt, she said his socks were not high enough. This, by the way, is fucking bullshit. Don’t accept them at the check-in and on the first attempt. And if you do, take us out to dinner first, because I like to be wined and dined before I’m FUCKED IN THE ASS. While another judge would apologize for this, as a coach I’m not going to allow socks that are questionable. Check the equipment, don’t let the socks touch the knee sleeves, and don’t wear underwear or spandex under the singlet (you might be sneaking some squat briefs).</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Lesson – Third Attempts</strong></p>
<p>Only 4 of 11 lifters made their third attempt squat. Courtney, Wendy, AC, and Mike did. Sean missed his because we went for a record (probably a bit more of a jump than normal, had to pull the trigger though). Andrew didn’t have a chance to do his because of the “wrong opening attempt” fiasco, so he’s not a good data point. Drew is a shitty data point because he was not actually squatting correctly. I just realized I forgot to recap Drew’s meet — SORRY DREW. He had this hunkered over squat with the bar two inches <em>below</em> the crease of his armpit. This means that his torso was inclined forward more than 45 degrees, and that does not fly in USAPL, at least not at the stricter national meet. In any case, he had a crack at an attempt on the third attempt after changing the bar position and standing up more to get a rack command, but the squat was high. He is not a good data point because it was literally the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen and unacceptable in the meet. Brent, Norman, and Jordan missed there thirds, and for each of them I would point to the programming leading into the meet. Jordan and Chris were more mechanical issues — they both came forward slightly to not engage their posterior chain and didn’t have hip drive. So 4 of 9 lifters made their attempts, and 3 of those 5 that missed can easily hit a third with modifying their program.</p>
<p>5 of 11 people made their third bench, but two of the misses were due to injuries, so it’s more like 5 of 9. Courtney, Brent, Sean, Andrew, and Chris made their thirds. AC and Mike missed due to injuries. Then Wendy, Jordan, Norman, and Drew — the four who missed and didn’t have an injury — all had reasonable jumps. Had I planned Wendy’s attempts I probably would have gotten her a third, but she had hit openers and went based on feel. The rest of the fellas just had 5kg jumps after second attempts that were around moderate difficulty.</p>
<p>4/11 made their third deadlifts. Two misses are artificial here. Wendy actually locked out her third attempt, but she hitched it on the way because she didn’t have baby powder on (my fault). Mike missed his third because it rolled his singlet up and got caught on it. Those are two issues that are easily correctable. So 5 of 9 legitimately missed. Courtney’s miss was due to her programming; she didn’t have any high intensity pulling (it was low intensity, high volume), and that has to be there for powerlifting. Brent, Andrew, Drew, and Norman missed because of their programming. Deadlift, more so than the other lifts, has to be trained so that the body can lockout heavy pulls when it’s already fatigued. Norman in particular was completely exhausted; he hadn’t done a meet since December, I think. The other guys just missed weights that should have been doable (all the weights were below what they wanted to hit) because they hadn’t trained specifically to hit a third dead. Brent even said that he hadn’t deadlifted a lot in training.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson. Unless you are specifically doing things to account for third attempt possibilities in training (which is taught and explained in <a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Advanced</a>), then plan on more conservative attempts. Everyone, except for Mike, <em>always</em> has an unrealistic view of what they want to hit. I mean, Courtney was talking about hitting 375 (she’s done it before, not in a meet), and she finished with 325 (missed 353, which is doable with proper programming). AC and Chris weren’t unrealistic because we decided what we wanted to hit a couple of months ago, though Chris still was hoping high for his deadlift.</p>
<p>Just trust me on this. This lesson ties in intimately with the second lesson: the fact that it’s a big meet means you won’t do as well. That could be the case for a variety of reasons, but that’s just the way it is. Until you have done a few of these big meets, you will fall victim to this reality, so plan around it. I’ll be talking more about this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Lessons</strong></p>
<p>**Like I said, there were ups and downs. When you look at the completion numbers, it’s not exactly pretty. However, four people medaled (were at least top 5), Mike was a singlet malfunction away from 5th place, and AC was 15kg away from 5th place (doable with a healthy shoulder and a chance on what we wanted for the third deadlift). Two younger guys bombed out, one because his attempt was wrong (and I didn’t fix it) and the other because he’s squatted silly all year. 6 people qualified for the Arnolds, and if Brent hit one more lift he would have qualified (I should have kept an eye on this, but no one was talking about it that day). **</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s a competition for everyone, so everyone has to be on their toes. I learned a lot as a coach that will help me prevent a lot of the bad things that people had to go through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National meets mean the lifter won’t lift as much. That’s just how it is unless they are experienced. Plan around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triple check everything. This will prevent any equipment or attempt card malfunctions. And then check them again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since lifters won’t lift as much, plan the third attempts accordingly. A small PR is still a PR, and it’s better than missing a lift. Account for malfunctions with baby powder and get singlets out of the way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you guys have any questions about this meet, or other meets, drop them in the comments. The meet was awesome, there were a lot of big lifts. Powerlifting legend Brad Gillingham, possibly one of the best super heavyweights in history and has pulled over 800 pounds in over 80 competitions, competed and only placed second! Kimberly Walford was red lighted on a 507 deadlift (she locked it out) in the 148 pound weight class. Ian Bell deadlifted 705 on his second attempt in the 198 weight class and LOST (made 2nd place). Our friend AJ Lareto deadlifted 650 in the 198 class and only placed FOURTH. This is raw lifting, folks, and the standards are strict. It’s a good show.</p>

<p>**Arin Canecchio **returned to the “national scene” (his last national meet was in 2010) in the 220 class. He’s had a few things get in the way of training including surgery to remove a cyst on his ass earlier this year and recently a shoulder issue (his acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joint — I think it’s due to elbow flare on the bench). The shoulder would give him some issues on the platform during bench. He’s looking forward to the opportunity to consistently train without set backs.</p>

    AC, Justin, Norman, and Chris
  </p>
</div>
<p>We opened with an easy 518 on the squat (AC has routinely hit 10 or 15 pounds more than this for doubles). AC is a pretty emotional lifter and induces huge spikes of adrenaline. Sometimes I wonder if he’s getting too amped for his early attempts and I wonder if it would be better to save them for later attempts (especially over a long meet). In any case, he destroyed the opener and we moved up to an equally successful lift of 540. I called for our plan of 562 for the third; I had been telling AC for a couple of months that I wanted him to hit this weight. He got amped, un-racked it, took it for a ride, and had consistent speed on the ascent for three white lights followed by a victory scream. He’s fun to coach.</p>
<p>AC took an easy bench opener of 364, but the aforementioned shoulder issue (left side) made 386 difficult. He got it, but the bar wasn’t even on the way up and it was a grinding rep. I gave him a 2.5kg jump to 392, which would have been a meet PR, but it was too heavy with the shoulder tweak. We’ll get this issue taken care of.</p>
<p>We opened deadlift with an easy 502 as the last warm-up. Then, as he was about to do 546 for his second, the judge at the chalk stand told him that his socks weren’t high enough. Mind you, this was after they were not only verified at the equipment check-in, but she allowed him to do his first attempt with them on. AC was livid when the clock ran down as he was trying to change socks. I did some quick thinking and put in a lighter third attempt than we planned (you can change 3rd deadlifts twice) and then took him in the back, had help quickly loading 545 in the warm-up room, and had him hit it. It wasn’t as fast as I would have liked because he wasn’t able to get psyched like he would have on the competition platform, so I stayed with the 573 I called for.</p>
<p>AC gripped it, ripped it, and had a pretty simple white lighted third attempt at 573. There was some weight left on the bar; he had at least 584 and probably 590, but I don’t regret the decision given the circumstances. It was a pretty good meet for AC, and consistent training will let his numbers push on up. I’d like to see him squat 600, bench over 400, and deadlift over 600. I think he could hit those numbers by next spring. The bench is there, we just have to address the shoulder issue.</p>
<p><strong>Norman Palencia</strong> was in the same 220 session as AC. I think this was his second meet and first national meet. I’ve known him for a few years and he has really improved as a lifter since he’s gotten out of the military (i.e. he’s been able to gain some weight). Norman’s squat technique is pretty good, and he hit simple attempts at 419 and and 441. He missed the third at 463; if I remember correctly he had a shift forward and lost his hip engagement (when force production shifts to the quads and leaves the posterior chain, there is less musculature helping to move the weight).</p>
<p>Norman took an easy opener at 298 and followed it with a successful second at 314. The 5kg jump to 325 proved to be too heavy that day and he finished 2/3. We opened with a low 474 as a last warm-up on the deadlift. Throughout the day, Norman wasn’t really emotionally aggressive like AC, which is fine, but his energy levels seemed to be dwindling. He had a crack at 513, but the miss was over pretty quickly. It’s a weight that he’s pulled for multiple reps in the past, and just the intermediate jump to around 540 or so, but he was, in his words, exhausted. Meets, especially national meets, are a bit different than training. Factor in that he dropped a little bit of weight and traveled by airplane, and it wreaks havoc on a newer lifter. I wish we could have hit some better numbers with Norman because powerlifting won’t be his primary focus due to a future job, but he will still improve if he chooses to dabble in the future. As a side note, Norman is one of Brent’s favorite people now.</p>
<p>**Mike Battaglino **competed in the 275 class and was coming into this meet off a recent PT test (which always require dropping weight and not lifting as much, though I wonder if he can do it without disrupting the training schedule next time). We opened the squat with an easy 529. Mike was red lighted on his last two attempts at the Arnold so he’s modified his squat so that it’s without question. He made good on a jump to 557, and then he requested 573 on the third, which was a bit lower than the high-end plan of 579. He came out, got rowdy, took it for a ride, and ground through a pretty simple squat. There was weight left on the bar, but it probably felt good to hit a third attempt knowing he had more in him (it tied a meet PR).</p>

</div>
<p>Mike’s bench has really improved lately, but a few weeks ago he tweaked his distal biceps un-racking a bench without a hand-off (do not do this). His warm-ups were fast and felt good, yet his bottom position was very unstable on his opener of 325. What happened is the bar went down, then settled quickly on his chest which made it bob up and down, then finally stopped while he was relaxed. Since he wasn’t tight, and the pause was so long due to the movement, he had a harder time with the attempt. This same position occurred on the second attempt and his injured side trailed during the miss. We attempted the same weight of 342 on the third attempt, and I gave him the cue to “drive right” to over-emphasize the right arm’s drive. It turned out that the soft bottom position was too much to overcome, though it was slightly better, on this third rep. Mike was bummed but there wasn’t anything we could have done about the injury.</p>
<p>Mike opened on deadlift with an easy 562 as a last warm-up, then his a slightly slower 611 on the second. We decide to go for 639, which is well within his grasp. On another note, Mike is battling with Randy Cairns for a fifth place (i.e. medal spot). As long as he hits this third attempt, he’ll beat him. It’s not that we don’t like Randy — he’s a good guy — but he has beaten Mike twice and it’s a friendly rivalry. Randy missed his third deadlift, so we could have changed Mike’s third attempt lower to make an easier pull for 5th, but we weren’t gunning for 5th. We were more trying to get a solid pull on the third since he missed his third deadlift at the Arnold.</p>
<p>Mike approached 639, gripped it, and then started the pull. He’s fast off the floor, but due to his short torso, it always slows right around the knees. We knew it’d be a battle, but the bar was moving well up his baby powdered thighs…until the left side of the bar — the side I’m standing on — gets caught on the band of his singlet. He’s wearing a weightlifting singlet, and it pulls the band inside out so that the rubber coating is now in contact with the bar. This causes the left side to fully stop, and if you watch the video, the right side actually continues moving up while the left side is stationary. I’m fully convinced that if his singlet was pulled up into his testicles, the bar would have slid up his thighs no big deal. Mike missed this third deadlift, and it left a sour taste in our mouths. You hate to see a lifter go through something like this, especially when it’s one of your best friends.</p>
<p>It turned out that Randy and Mike totaled exactly the same. And they weighed exactly the same (the lighter body weight will win when totals are equal) at 124kg. Since Mike had the chance to change his attempt after Randy’s third (and make a change to beat him whereas Randy couldn’t make a change), the decision was awarded to Randy. Mike was given a “participation” medal, which only pissed him off.</p>
<p>Mike is good powerlifter. He has made consistent progress in everything since I met him. He is meticulous with his training, makes good programmatic changes, is good at planning attempts for himself and others, and will be a very good coach some day (he is one now). Whenever his next meet is, he’ll squat at least 579, bench at least 353, and deadlift at least 644. It’s just a bummer to have this one meet swing on the completion of one lift, especially when it was due to an equipment issue. He’ll be back.</p>
<p>**Chris Riley **was looking to improve on all of his solid numbers at the Arnold in a heavily stacked super heavyweight class. Raw nationals gets more competitive every year because the first place winner makes the world. Brad Gillingham, one of the most legendary super heavyweight powerlifters of all time (he has pulled over 800 in over 80 competitions) didn’t even place first!</p>

<p>We opened with a no big deal 617 squat, then moved to the planned 644 on the second. He got it, but not without struggle. I saw him shift slightly forward and lose the hamstring/hip engagement that I’ve talked about prior in this meet write up series. Had he thought “push butt” up, then I think he could have kept the mechanics and had more musculature involved to have an easier rep. I asked Chris if he wanted me to cue that, and he said that he could correct it. We originally wanted to call for 666, a 2.5kg PR over his 661 at the Arnold, but since it looked slow, I called for 661 to tie it. After talking with him, I might have changed the third to 666, but you can’t change 3rd attempt squats.</p>
<p>Well, the same thing occurred on the ascent of the third squat, and Chris got hung up in the middle of the rep and missed it because of a lack of hip involvement. I think that this is due to Chris getting in the habit of getting “into his knees” on his heavy squats, so we’re going to make a point of making sure he gets and keeps tension on his posterior chain. I might modify the actual programming to, so we’ll see what happens.</p>
<p>Chris bench opener was 364. The particular guy giving the hand off was different than the first flight (Mike’s flight, he had done it all weekend), and he unfortunately wasn’t very good at it. When he gave Chris the bar on the opener, he brought it way out over his chest. Chris got the rep, but he had to pull the bar back into the right position, wasting time, and throwing him a bit off mentally. I called for the planned 386 and Chris and I both asked the guy to not bring the bar so far out. On the second attempt, the back spotter just lifted the bar straight up, and Chris had to pull the bar down into position while under a load, which is the same position that Mike injured his biceps in a few weeks ago. This pissed Chris off again, made him use a bunch of energy stabilizing the bar, and wasted time. He ended up missing the rep. I called for the same weight (we had planned to go up to 402 with Chris’ close grip style) and asked the judges if we could get a different person to hand-off. The loaders all did a great job, but this one particular guy probably wasn’t experienced in hand-offs and it had an effect on Chris’ performance. They brought the original back spotter out, and he gave Chris a good lift-off and he made the 385.</p>
<p>We opened with a frighteningly fast 611 on the deadlift opener (last warm-up); the plates bobbed up and down at the lockout. Then we took 666 as the intermediate jump for the second attempt. Chris had been wanting to try and hit as high as 727 coming into this meet, but in truth I had always planned on calling 711 or 717 (him reading this will probably be the firs time he hears this). The 666 was slightly slower than I would have liked, and Mike and I agreed on 711 (though I almost pushed for 717). I settled on the former because I would rather him meet PR on the deadlift since he missed his third squat and only matched his meet PR bench.</p>
<p>Chris stepped into the room as they loaded his bar, adrenaline surging. The meet was located within a church, and I hope that they didn’t mind that we were summoning the demons. I pulled his headphones out and said some choice words and pushed him to the bar as he grunted loudly, nips sticking out of his singlet. He gripped the bar with his double overhand hook grip, took a breath, set his back, and started the pull. Chris has beautiful technique, even with heavier weights. His long torso, giant back, long arms, and short femurs make it possible. The bar never strays away from his legs, and he has long ago learned to make the lockout smooth. He knows how to battle. If I call the right weight, he’s gonna lock it out. And he ground through that rep with the crowd yelling, my throat straining for the last time that weekend. And then he finally locked 711, a full convenience store, out for three white lights. This was particularly satisfying for me as a coach and a really good cap to the long weekend. Chris screamed to the crowd, I screamed and jumped behind him, and we tackled each other in celebration. I was still slapping the wall when we walked down the hall and the old men who were running the church’s food services said, “Well, I suppose you got it. Congratulations.”</p>
<p>I joke around that I hate powerlifting when the meets are over, but I don’t really hate it. In the next post I’ll talk briefly on coaching and the lessons learned over the course of this meet. I felt that I owed it to the lifters to recap their experiences. They all chose to buck up and compete at a national event when so many people shy away from competition. They all did the best they could with the circumstances presented to them, and that counts for something. Through victory or defeat, and their were both this past weekend, competition is something that defines the soul.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena…who strives…who spends himself…and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.</p>
<p>–Teddy Roosevelt</p>

  <p>I’ve been trying to figure out how I’m going to write about this meet for a while, and I think I’ll talk about some general stuff, quickly recap the lifters, and then tomorrow expand on the lessons learned (mostly the hard way). I handled 11 lifters over this three day meet, but had some help here and there. I’d like to thank the following people for helping:</p>
<p>Mike Battaglino, one of my closest friends, has a good coaching and programming eye; he’s going to be a very good powerlifting coach. He helped choose some attempts and managed some warm-ups in the instances where I had multiple lifters in the same session. Elliot Rowe handled all of the filming duties on Saturday, and for that we are grateful  Jacob Tsypkin, Elliot’s coach, would drop whatever he was doing and help load warm-up bars for the lifters. Chris partially took the handling duties of one of the younger lifters from Wichita Falls while I handled AC and Norman on another platform. Brent, AC, Norman, AJ, and Big Cat also helped at various points that made it possible for me to focus on preparing the athlete and counting attempts. Thanks everyone.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Of the 11 lifters, I’d say that 6 of them had pretty good meets. I personally played a role in the preparation of AC, Chris, and Mike (Brent does his thing, but he gave me more control of his attempts). Courtney, Wendy, Sean, Jordan, Andrew, Drew, and Norman had prepared on their own. I helped Jordan taper, have coached Courtney before, and have been friends with Norman for a while yet never coached him. Handling lifters is all about getting the most out of what they can do on that day, and I think I did that for pretty much everyone, especially Courtney, Wendy, Sean, Jordan, AC, and Chris (the others typically had circumstances they couldn’t control). In chronological order:</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>**Courtney Modecki **is a strong little girl who has been involved with CrossFit for a while and lifted in the 132 class. She trains at Outlaw CrossFit, was on their affiliate team, and rotates through strength training, CrossFit regionals, weightlifting, and now powerlifting throughout the year. She has a lot of potential in both powerlifting and weightlifting. Since Jennifer Thompson dropped back down to the 132 class, our goal was to get second place and hit meet PRs. Note that gym PRs are not the same as meet PRs; they’re largely irrelevant for competitors. I planned all of her attempts based on her high-end goals and what she hit recently in training.</p>
<p>Courtney opened the squat with a no-big-deal 253. She was then red lighted for depth on her second squat of 275. The squat wasn’t hard, and I was confident I could cue her to fix it, so I made a 5kg jump to 287 lbs. We originally wanted closer to 297 on the high end, but missing 275 changed things. I gave her the cues, sent her out, and she made good on the 3rd attempt of 287, setting a meet PR (she may have had enough for 292, but I’m happy with the 287 call). Courtney then went 3 for 3 on bench, hitting 127, 138, and 148 in succession. I don’t remember any issues on bench; as she focuses on this sport, her bench will improve. We opened lighter on the deadlift at 292 and then  hit a medium to moderately difficult 325 on the second. It wasn’t hard enough where I didn’t think I couldn’t make a 12.5kg jump to 353, but Courtney was out of gas on the third attempt and missed it. I attribute this to her training — a Sheiko volume program doesn’t allow any higher intensity lifts, so she wasn’t adapted to hitting several maximal lifts on squat and deadlift. Not to mention she traveled, was at her first national meet, and was tired. In any case, finishing with 287/148/325 gave her second place at her first raw nationals. Courtney has the most room to improve on the deadlift (she’s pulled 365 in the gym), but her squat and bench will steadily improve with consistent attention.</p>
<p><strong>Brent Kim</strong> is Brent Kim. For the most part he has a template he sticks to, but it’s broken up by his work schedule and biceps curls (I think). I guess his training was regular leading into this meet, but he had commented that he hadn’t deadlifted a whole lot. A difference between last year and this year is that Brent high bar squats. He had decided on some openers, but I talked him into changing some of them (he beheld the instrument of his liberation). We took 418 on his opener, then a 7.5kg jump to 435. We then made another 7.5kg jump to 451 and he missed it. My guess is his training hasn’t been conducive to multiple high intensity squat sets. This can be easily rectified, even if Brent keeps splitting time between weightlifting, powerlifting, and swollertrophy. He’s looking good, by the way (the fire rises).</p>
<p>Brent went 3/3 on bench, which I think might be a PR, but he meet PR’d with 275 on the third. I think it was satisfying to him to hit that milestone, because he was abnormally happy after the lift. Brent wanted to open kind of heavy on his deadlift, and I talked him into opening lower so that we could get his third. He hit 386 as a “last warm-up on the platform”, then 430. It didn’t look fast, but I still called for 463 on the third. He missed it after getting it off the floor (he didn’t feel in charge). At the time I felt that it may have been something he could have ground through (he seemed to just turn off when it it slowed), yet it’s a function of apparently not deadlifting a lot, and therefore not being used to the tension at that intensity. Squatting and deadlifting around 430 at 154 pounds is still good, but I felt that I could have gotten a bit more out of Brent and it’s bothered me since. Maybe it’s because Rachel wrote a leh-uh, and in that leh-uh, she chose Hah-veeh. Even though he didn’t hit the numbers we wanted, Brent still got 5th place.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Hajik</strong> is my new buddy who trains at the same gym as Brent (he avoids speaking with her along with any other female). Brent sort of introduced us and I asked who she was there with, and she was about to compete in her second national meet by herself. II offered to at least count attempts for her if she wanted it. She accepted, so I helped her warm-up and got her ready for squat. Wendy has short, explosive upright squats with a high bar; short femurs are good for that. She was set on her openers but said she would “figure it out based on how it felt”. That’s not really how I roll when I handle someone, but I didn’t want to interfere or change much since we had just met.</p>
<p>Wendy opened with 304 <em>pounds</em> on the squat. She crushed the opener and…then stepped forward before the rack command and was red lighted. I felt terrible because I always tell my lifters to wait, especially on the first squat. I had the impression she was more experienced than her four previous meets (I found this out later); it was also her first national meet. I still feel like it was my responsibility, I just didn’t want to over step my bounds as a handler when I had just met her. In any case, she took the same weight on the second attempt and…shifted her hips backwards and missed the second attempt. I would later find out that her weightlifting shoes were stolen a couple weeks prior; the minimalist running shoes she’s wearing undoubtedly attributed to the technique miss.</p>
<p>At this point Wendy is borderline freaking out at bombing out of the meet. People keep coming up to her and talking to her. They all walked away and I said, “Look, I don’t know what all of these people are saying, but you’ve done thousands of squats before, right? This next one won’t be any different. Take a deep breath. Visualize what a normal squat feels like. You’ll be fine.” I had her relax and visualize a few times as she waited. When her bar was loaded, she walked out, went through her routine and…squatted the weight up for three white lights. When they beamed, she IMMEDIATELY burst into tears, sprinted, and jumped into my arms. And stayed there for ten seconds. I actually walked back to the warm-up room carrying her. I didn’t realize how nervous she was, because, in her words, she “gets pretty zen” before doing a lift. It was a high pressure situation and she came through for an impressive 304 squat — a bit more than double body weight (148 lb weight class).</p>
<p>Wendy went 2/3 on bench, hitting 134, then sort of a hard 148 (a 7.5kg jump). I made the smallest jump (2.5kg) to her third at 70 and she missed it. No big deal; who benches anyway? Wendy opened on deadlift with a simple 314 lbs. Then we took 331 for a moderate second attempt. At this point, things were getting fun. She was competing with another lifter, Jill Joiner-Wong for second place (1st place was locked up by world champion Kimberly Walford, who had a completed deadlift of 507 red lighted in this meet!). Jill called for 342 on her final deadlift and so we called for 353 to have a 2.5kg edge in the total (Wendy squatted more than Jill, Jill benched more than Wendy, and  success with Wendy’s 353 would mean she totals 2.5kg more [Jill was lighter, so tying the total would have let Jill win 2nd]).</p>
<p>I asked Wendy four times if she wanted baby powder on her thighs. She insisted in wouldn’t be an issue. This would prove to be a regrettable decision. Wendy pulled a very hard third attempt with 353 and slowly locked it out…yet her leg movement and the bar sticking to her thighs resulted in the judges red lighting it for hitching. Had I applied baby powder to her legs, she would have gotten it.</p>
<p>Not a bad meet, especially with how the squat started. I know how I’ll handle these situations in the future by always cuing the “wait” before the first squat and applying the baby powder, but I’m pretty sure Wendy will use it forever from now on. Wendy also qualified for the Arnold, so we’ll see her again there.</p>
<p><strong>Sean Dunston</strong> trains at Outlaw CrossFit and has posted on 70’s Big since the beginning. He competed in the master’s and open 181 class (I handled 2 other lifters in this class). He squatted 435 and 457, so we went for a national master’s record of 480 on the third attempt. Unfortunately it just wasn’t there that day, but I think it’s doable in the future. Sean then went 3/3 on bench hitting 220, 237, and 254. He opened deadlift with an easy 440, hit a second attempt of 474, and then hit a meet and lifetime PR deadlift of 507. There was more in the tank as well, but he was happy with that pull and it capped off a great meet. Sean finished 8/9 and I think he got second in his master’s class.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Feigenbaum</strong> is a meticulous lifter who was competing in his second meet (first nationals) and aimed to qualify for the Arnold. His body fat sits at sub 7%, so he’ll eventually move into the 198 weight class (he has room to fill out, he’s around 5’10” or so). We opened with 419 and then hit 441 on the second attempt. He missed his third of 463, and I sort of recall it being a mechanical issue. Had he been thinking “push hips”, he would have kept his posterior chain engaged instead of shifting forward into the quads. Jordan opened on bench at 308, then hit 320, but had a crack at 331 before missing it. He opened with a solid 507 opener, qualified for the Arnold with a 529 second attempt, and that had a really solid battle on a successful third attempt at 551. I was really happy to see Jordan hit the 551, especially since we didn’t get his third squat and bench. I think modifying his training can facilitate the third attempts on the other lifts. Great second meet for Jordan, he qualified for the Arnolds, and he finished 8th overall in a very competitive 181 class.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Pichardo</strong> is a friend of Chris’ from Wichita Fallsand was also competing in the 181 session in his second meet (first national meet). I wasn’t present at the fellas’ weigh-in because I went to get breakfast (one of my two main meals of the day), so I missed the fact that Andrew’s squat opener was incorrectly labeled as 220kg AKA 485 — higher than what we planned for his third attempt. The actual attempt was supposed to be 200kg AKA 441, and I just didn’t pay attention to what was on the chart projected on the wall. As the coach, I should have double checked all of the openers (there were two instances of openers being wrong later in the weekend, one was the lifter’s fault, the other the judge’s fault) and I feel that this is my fault. I didn’t find out about the wrong weight until Andrew was pinned on his first attempt. When the bar was loaded it was too late anyway, because he signed the card. Still, I could have prevented the snafu. I took him in the back to hit 445, and it was a grinder; he barely got it. I had to tell him that he wouldn’t be getting any squats that day and I waved his third attempt.</p>
<p>We had trouble on his first two bench attempts at 270 (I can’t recall exactly what the problem was), but he came back and made good on a third attempt at the same weight. At this point I feel terrible and only want Andrew to deadlift well since the world has gone to shit on squat and bench. We hit 463 on the first, then a moderate 507 on the second attempt. It wasn’t slow enough that I didn’t have issues calling for 546 on the third (lower than what he originally planned if I recall), but when you aren’t adapted to multiple high intensity pulls <em>and</em> you cut weight for the meet, it results in being fatigued for third attempts at a national meet. The 546 didn’t go. Andrew and I both learned a lot at this meet, and I felt terrible for him because I knew I could have prevented it from happening. This experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth because I messed up, but he got to experience his first national meet and still hit 507 in competition.</p>
<p>The next update will have the rest of the lifters.</p>

<p>I’m really good at pointing out things that are wrong, so let’s get started.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Nobody in this video can string a sentence together confidently. At one point Maurice Greene says that the coach is going “to facilitate us on the weightroom”. Huh??? Then he says, “Here we have Montel Douglas who is the British national record holder…for Great Britain…and shit.” I added the last part because they undoubtedly had to edit that part out. Then the coach makes up his sentence as he goes along as if he’s never had to think about it before. Then he says the squat is “important for a track athlete to simply create force into the ground”. To clarify, we don’t summon force out of thin air like a demon, we <em>apply</em> force into the ground so that Newton’s third law occurs (equal and opposite reaction) to move. I’m not expecting this explanation, but I am expecting correct terminology when you’re a supposed expert.</p>
<p>I could keep going. “We go a hip-width distance” — of what? “We feel that halfway to a quarter is deep enough,” — sharing your feelings is not a way to prove why to do something.</p>
<p>Sure, even I have bad days with communicating, but this was terrible. What is Montel the world record holder of? Why should track athletes lift weights? What is this squat movement accomplishing? Why is this “new” movement beneficial?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> “What better exercise to load the lower body than the barbell squat,” and then he hardly loads the body by doing a partial rep. And wasn’t this the reason that Maurice stated that they <em>didn’t</em> want to go deeper?</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> “Puts a lot of stress on yo body, creates injuries…and shit”. If you perform the squat like Maurice Greene, who is labeling himself as the expert, then yes, they can be injurious. In fact, decent squats can be injurious if regular mobility work isn’t performed. This is why a proper squat is done with the hip going below the knee so that it trains the lower body joints and musculature through a full range of motion. This is also why proper foot attire is worn to increase the efficiency and subsequently the safety. Remember that lifting shoes have the slight heel increase, the non-compressible sole, the meta-tarsal straps, and the wider sole base to help solidify the articulation of the athlete to the ground so that they can properly <em>apply</em> force. Furthermore, lifting shoes help utilize the body’s mechanics more efficiently to distribute force evenly across the thighs and hips regardless of anthropometry. A belt will only increase all of this efficiency by increasing the intra-abdominal and thoracic pressure, increasing the stability of the trunk which will not only improve the transmission of force (AKA performance), but help protect the spine by improving the pneumatic “brace” against the anterior portion of the spine.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Since when do sprinters run with a short range of motion? I haven’t watched sprinting in this year’s Olympics, but my understanding is that good sprinting takes the hips through, or nearly through, a full range of motion. Wouldn’t we want to train all of this musculature through a full, albeit safe, ROM so that we are as strong as possible? Even if this wouldn’t help us apply force, which it does, it would at least strengthen the musculature through a full ROM to help reduce the chance of injury since the structures adapt to handling greater forces.</p>

    Oh, that&#8217;s weird. Here&#8217;s a pic of Maurice Greene with both of his hips near or at their limit of hip flexion and extension.
  </p>
</div>
<p><strong>5.</strong> I could understand an argument that full ROM squats may be too stressful for inclusion in a sprint program in the same way that I say deadlifts are too stressful for certain stages of programs (i.e. for Oly lifters, soldiers, or football players), but that’s not the argument here. Furthermore, even if it was, the sprint athlete most likely has a periodized approach to their training year, especially if they are peaking for World Championships or the Olympics. Therefore they’d be changing the volume, intensity, and frequency of their squatting. Also, they would, at this point, be adapted to handling both squatting and sprinting during the week because they have been progressed into it.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> I’m pretty sure that when I was younger I read an article in Men’s Health (or similar crappy magazine) that Maurice Greene was squatting 315 for sets of 10 in his training. I’ve seen reports that he squatted above 500. Even if it wasn’t Maurice in the mag, there are many documented reports of him squatting decently heavy to prepare for his sprinting. We can assume he at least went to the depth he showed in the above video. Wouldn’t that show us that it worked? He held the world record in the 100m at 9.79s, he won two gold medals, a silver, and a bronze. He won five world championships as well as one indoor world championship. Can we not say that squatting supported all of this? When he won his gold medals at the 2000 Games, he was 26. In 2001, he started having issues with injuries, but still won the silver and bronze in the 2004 Games at 30 years old. He eventually retired in 2005 at the age of 31. His first major international tournament was in 1995 when he was 21 years old and he failed to make the Olympic team the following year. This means that he had at least 10 years of hard, elite-level training. We can assume that he was training for at least 3 years before his first major tournament, putting his highly demanding competitive years at 13. He probably ran track in high school, but we’ll ignore those four possible years.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean? He was very accomplished, but as he got older, his body broke down. This happens to everyone. There isn’t enough performance enhancement drugs to account for getting older (Greene said he bought PEDs, but allegedly didn’t use them). 30 years old is ancient in demanding professional sports. Most guys are out of the NFL before they are 28. It’s not that crazy to assume that his body couldn’t keep up with the demands of elite level sprint training anymore, and this is almost certainly what happened. Sure, he could have gotten hurt squatting, but he was “getting old”. 30 isn’t old, all things considered, but it is for Olympians in a high demanding sport. Sorry Maurice, just because you regret having to retire and don’t accept the fact that you can’t retain physical prowess forever doesn’t meant that full squats are bad or injurious. And we aren’t even taking the fact that you don’t squat efficiently into consideration. It’s hard for me to take a guy seriously who squatted his whole life, had an amazing career, and then campaigns against doing them.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Track coaches do some weird things. Barry Ross has his sprinters deadlift the bar to the knees, then drop it to the floor. This removes the eccentric portion which apparently helps reduce injuries. It’s a “halting deadlift”, which is typically really fucking useless, but in this case I can see the applicability because it strengthens the concentric action of the hamstrings, but more importantly strengthens the back and hip musculature to stabilize everything for sprinting. I explain this concept in my seminars, but if your hips are not held in place during sprinting, then you are losing out on some arbitrary amount of force you area <em>applying</em> to the ground with each foot strike.</p>
<p>I can understand the above example for a specific type of athlete with a specific mechanical and structural demand for a single modality athletic event. I concede to the fact that something weird may be applicable to a very specific athlete. However, the above example is supported by anatomy, mechanics, and logic; the quarter squat is not. It mostly loads the knee extensors through a few degrees of motion. I guess it looks like that <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tqNJBoPyThM/TIpXzDzkIjI/AAAAAAAAAWA/J3UdV4ySkgM/s1600/VMO_Dip.jpg" target="_blank">stupid VMO exercise</a> people use while standing on a block. I’m not against using weird, yet specific assistance exercises to build up an area that can enhance total movement. But don’t label it as something that is the holy grail or the primary strengthener. In other words, don’t use a cute, gimmicky exercise and sell it as the “main thing to do”. That’s the only way that I could see the quarter squat being used, but even then it doesn’t make sense from an anatomical, mechanics, or logical perspective.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> The athlete can be good in spite of stupid exercises. There’s a guy who trained in the gym in Texas. He is a white guy of average height and weight and played collegiate football. He is a freak. He has at least a 40 inch vertical and would be squatting 500 for reps within several minutes of walking in the gym. In basketball shoes. He didn’t really listen to coaching very well and just did his own thing, but he was strong as hell doing it his way. He reportedly squatted 700 pounds in college and <em>was the quarterback</em>.</p>
<p>My point? In spite of not having completely sound mechanics, this guy was strong and powerful. And he’s not an Olympian or an elite athlete. Imagine someone who is not only gifted physically, but has the drive and determination to be great. They are truly a freak in the average person’s eyes, capable of outstanding performances. People like this can and will make progress in spite of inefficient training techniques or programming because they have such a great genetic potential and an iron will to work hard.</p>
<p>We see this all of the time with crappy strength programs in collegiate, even high school, settings that produce beasts that can bench 500 pounds and squat 600+ with little to no training. It’s not absurd to have an elite athlete do a stupid, meaningless exercise and they will improve nonetheless. Some strengthening is better than no strengthening, but that doesn’t mean it’s right.</p>
<p><strong>This means that regardless of ability</strong>, a coach should do his job to strengthen the relevant musculature through full ranges of motion, maintaining or improving the mobility of the athlete, and not only _not _injure the athlete, but train them so that they are harder to hurt. By these qualifications, the coach in the video failed.</p>
<p>At least there are some Olympians who understand the power of squats.</p>

  <p>For fuck’s sake, you guys are blowing me up constantly for weightlifting streams. You can do one of several things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to All Things Gym and look at his <a href="http://www.allthingsgym.com/2012/07/how-to-watch-the-olympics-online/" target="_blank">nice, organized stream list</a>. I’m shocked at how organized this dude is; he’s on the internet a lot. In any case, he has a long list of various free streams you can use. Thanks, Gregor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch it on your home country’s network, assuming you have their cable package. I can tell you that Comcast blows and is difficult to deal with, so let’s go to the next option…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TUNNEL BEAR, ASSEMBLE! TunnelBear.com has a VPN for download, and it’s a cheaper option than other programs I’ve seen online. I don’t know what “VPN” is, and I don’t care. What it does is it makes your location appear from somewhere else. This is legal, and it can help protect you. In this case, we are using it to “tunnel” our position into the UK so that we can use the BBC live streams (they also have session recaps to re-watch any event). <a href="http://www.tunnelbear.com/help/" target="_blank">Read the FAQ</a> if you’re confused.</p>
</li>

  <p id="caption-attachment-7478" class="wp-caption-text">
    Bears are always funny. Tunnel Bears are always helpful.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Download the program for free, and you’ll get 500mb of data each month (Note: <a href="http://www.tunnelbear.com/twitter-promo/" target="_blank">If you tweet at TunnelBear</a>, they’ll give you 1gb for free within a day or so). <strong>Unlimited data is only $4.99/month</strong>, which is half the price of other options out there. To me it’s worth watching the lifting sessions, but I also get to stream all of the Olympic events live or re-watch all the events. I don’t get anything from Tunnel Bear, but I love bears and I love weightlifting.</p>
<p>Tunnel Bear is very simple. Download it. Install it. Sign up (free or paid). Install the network thingy (it’ll do it for you). Open program. Sign in. Flip the right switch to “UK”, flip the left switch to “On”. Wait a sec, and the gadget screen will turn blue. You’re good. Then go to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video" target="_blank">BBC stream site</a>. Load whatever you want to watch. The player will load and have a little “i&gt;” on the left. Click that to play. If you have issues with the stream, then reload. Be patient at first.</p>
<p>Personally, my stream is a bit choppy. When it plays, it’s very good quality, but it’ll pause once a minute for a few seconds and then keep going. This is due to my shitty internet connection at the house, so your results will vary. If you are worried about the expense, then try the free 500mb option before paying.</p>
<p>Thank you to <s>@</s>culfinglin for the tip on Tunnel Bear! _Edit: There’s no malware or adware in Tunnel Bear. _</p>

  <p>The Olympics do not occur every year, so I wanted to highlight some of the stories about women in the Olympics for today’s female post.</p>
<p><strong>Women In Numbers</strong></p>
<p>The biggest story prior to the start of the Olympics was that there were more American females competing than males. However, this is also the case for <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/07/29/2229263/these-olympics-to-be-remembered.html" target="_blank">all of the Olympians in this year’s games</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States is represented by more women than men for the first time ever. Russia also has more women competing. One hundred and twelve years after women were first allowed to compete, and 108 years after they were first awarded medals, more women will compete in these games than ever before, whether you count by percentage (45 percent) or total (4,860).</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
  Title IX was huge for growth in women&#8217;s sports. Nowadays women can earn their living in professional sports and, as of this year, women compete in every Olympic sport. It was a good step for a progressing American society; I hope it continues around the world.

    Ye Shiwen wins gold, breaks a record, faster than men, and is only 16
  </p>
</div>
<p>Despite the fact that American Ryan Lochte edged Michael Phelps for the gold medal in the 400-meter individual medley, China’s Ye Shiwen is receiving heaps of press. It’s not because she won a gold medal, but <em>how</em> she won the gold medal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 300m of fly, back and breaststroke, Ye was eight-tenths of a second behind USA’s world champion, Elizabeth Beisel. And then, with 100m to go, something extraordinary happened. She swam her first 50m of freestyle in 29.25sec, and her second in 28.93. Those are just numbers, and mean little to those who do not study the sport. <strong>To put them in context, consider this: Ye was faster in the final 50m of her own 400m IM than Lochte was in his.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dude. She was faster at the end of the race than the <em>best guy in the world</em>. And she’s 12 years younger than Lochte. To top it off, she was the first swimmer to break a world record in this Olympics by <em>more than a second</em>. She broke Steph Rice’s time that earned her a gold medal, and Rice was wearing the polyurethane suit that has since been banned. Impressive stuff from the young Chinese swimmer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>**There are plenty of stories **that have and will occur, and they all won’t be represented here. Feel free to post them on the Facebook page or tweet them at 70’s Big (I’ll retweet Olympics results). Here’s a few quick hitters:</p>
<p><strong>Kim Rhode</strong></p>
<p>The female athlete, 33, won the gold in women’s skeet shooting Sunday, making her the first U.S. contender to take an individual-sport medal in five back-to-back Olympics, <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-blogs/shooting/rhode-makes-olympic-history-with-gold-medal.html" target="_blank">according to the AP</a>. She also tied the world record and set an Olympic record: she shot 99 out of 100 targets. (<em>Editor’s Note: This was her fifth straight Olympics that she medaled in, setting an American record.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dana Vollmer</strong></p>
<p>The 24-year-old swimmer and defending world champion set a world record in the 100 M butterfly with a time of 55.98 seconds Sunday – good enough to earn her the gold medal, according to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dana-vollmer-of-united-states-wins-olympic-100-butterfly-gold-medal-in-world-record-time/2012/07/29/gJQAF8XcIX_story.html" target="_blank">the AP</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh</strong></p>
<p>The beach volleyball contenders are trying for a third consecutive gold medal – and they’re already well on their way to securing that win. On Saturday, the duo beat out Australians Tasmin Hinchley and Natalie Cook in a tense match that went way past 11 p.m. local time. The final score: 21-18 and 21-19. “I was worried,” Walsh <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8210009/2012-summer-olympics-kerri-walsh-misty-treanor-prevail-beach-volleyball-opener" target="_blank">said of playing so late</a>. “At home, it hits 11 and I’m a zombie. But we could play at 4 in the morning, we don’t care.”</p>

The first two paragraphs focus on an interesting turn of events in gymnastics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody saw this coming: Defending all-around champion <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=jordyn-wieber/index.html">Jordyn Wieber</a>, the face of this year’s U.S. women’s gymnastics squad, <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-blogs/2012/wieber-left-out-of-gymnastics-all-around.html">failed to qualify</a> for the finals in her signature event. She lost to teammate and friend <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=aly-raisman/index.html">Aly Raisman</a>, who turned in quite possibly the performance of her young life.</p>
<p>The emotional chaos that ensued after the scores were flashed said it all: Wieber stood crying in the background, head down, while Raisman tried to field a reporter’s questions even though she was crying herself, clearly torn by mixed emotions. Was this a blip on the radar for Raisman or is she about to step from the shadows to create her own legend? And will this blow rattle Wieber’s psyche or will she still be able to bring her best performance to the team competition? We’ll find out soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Justin,</p>
<p>A little context first I’m 32 and have a 13 year old brother, dad was active after he and mom split. So to the question at hand, I have a basic garage gym set up, rogue squat rack and bar w/some bumpers a pull up bar the basic crossfit set up. I’ve been doing “crossfit” for about 5 years now. My 13 year old brother is going to be starting football this year and wants to start working out. My old man not knowing any better almost bought him one of the cheap academy/sports place “home gym” things. I luckily advised him against this. But now he wants me to show the kid how to work out and set him up with some work outs. Stephen is 13 just started puberty and hit a growth spurt he is know about 5’8” and all skin and bones. I personally know how to do the lifts but would by no means call myself a coach or an expert. Would it be wise for me to teach him how to bench and squat correctly to knowledge and set him up with a squat rack and bench and pull up bar, or just run him through body weight movements and the like? I’ve tried finding some past q&amp;a on the subject in your website because I know I’ve seen it before but just can’t seem to find it now. Any help pointing me in the right direction would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mike</p>
<p>PS- doing the goruck in Austin in dec after reading your write up. Thanks for the extra push to get me to actually sign up for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Mike,</p>
<p>The GoRuck will be a good time. I’ll be doing a post soon on preparing for one, so keep an eye out. In the mean time, I’d suggest walking around with about 30 pounds in a pack for about an hour once a week and add some calisthenics after you lift.</p>
<p>As for your little brov, the thing that will help him the most is to get stronger. That doesn’t mean you’ll ignore spatial awareness or body weight stuff, but, yes, it’ll be worth your (and his) time to learn how to squat and bench. This could be fun or frustrating for you, but with kids it’s best to be patient. As long as you have him a) squatting down all the way with b) his chest up, and c) his knees out, he’ll be fine. Remember, any weight room coaches he has will probably know less than you. As for bench, just get a little bit of pinching the shoulder blades together and work on keeping his elbows from flaring. If you need to, use a bit more of a narrow grip than you’d expect to help the elbows stay under control. Don’t progress him if they flare. This will build his triceps, which is important for any football position.</p>
<p>Basic agility work wouldn’t hurt him. You could teach him the “athletic position”. It’s easier than it sounds: the athlete is on the balls of their feet (which is the base of the toes), stance shoulder width, knees and hips slightly bent. It allows quick change of direction. You could have him do the standard “chop the feet” and do whatever. Side shuffle, back pedaling, up-downs, or whatever. 30 seconds to 60 seconds of whatever you think of with half that time in rest. Do this to finish his workouts off. Total training time could be less than an hour. Make sure he’s having fun and be encouraging on his progress. Teach him that this stuff will make him better at football. If he believes it, then he’ll be a better player automatically. Give him confidence and teach respect, and he’ll do well in football.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/NicMcCool" data-send-impression-cookie="true"><s>@</s>NicMcCool</a>,</p>
<p>This type of injury is related to toe angle and squatting (see <a href="/blog/2012/03/hip-torque-toe-angle-and-squatting/" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="/blog/2012/03/should-i-point-my-toes-forward/" target="_blank">second</a> posts). Most people see that we eventually should have the toes pointed relatively forward, yet forget that <strong>toe angle is dependent on mobility</strong>.</p>
<p>Last December I had a similar injury. I did 72 clean and jerks, 31 of them with 300 pounds, for the Movember fundraiser (I don’t recommend this). My knees were crusty after this Thursday night session at my buddy Adam’s <a href="http://www.panhandlecrossfit.com/" target="_blank">Panhandle CrossFit</a>. Saturday I did an hour long ruck, and then Monday I was trying to warm-up to do some light or medium squats. I was squatting the bar, and tweaked the rear of my knee, just like Nic did above.</p>
<p>The reason is torsion. If you’ve been paying attention, you know that we <em>want</em> torsion, AKA torque AKA rotational force, at the hip because it helps to actively engage more musculature and more efficiently distributes the force of squatting or deadlifting across the thigh and hip. However, if a lifter doesn’t have the mobility — or their mobility has artificially been reduced due to structural stress (as in my case with the 72 clean and jerks and rucking) — then torsion can actually be an injurious act.</p>

See how it attaches medially below the knee and laterally above the knee? When the toes are more forward, the tibia will face relatively forward. Then when the knees are shoved out, the femur (thigh) will angle outwards. See how this would tug on the poplitues if the upper attachment was pulled out while the lower attachment was kept in?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The popliteus normally aids in un-locking the knee from terminal knee extension. When the knee is flexed, as is the case in the bottom of a squat, it is contracted. My reasoning is that the muscle is shortened (contracted) at the bottom of the squat, and then the attachment sites are pulled apart (described in the preceding paragraph), resulting in a strain. For me, I know that the rucking also “worked” or “fatigued” the poplitues since each step applies more than body weight on the structure (it inevitably distributes force during walking, yet adding 50 pounds more than body weight to an already tired structure (from the CJs) will weaken and damage it even more). When I went to do the squatting movement a couple of days later, my popliteus was “crusty”, which means it was damaged, inflamed, and tender. Then I contracted it with knee flexion and then shoved my knees out which applied tension on a shortened muscle belly, and voila, it was “yanked” AKA strained.</p>
<p>I see this as a potential problem for people attempting “forward toe angle” style squatting when they lack the mobility in their hips, knees, and ankles to accommodate it. That’s why my suggestion has always been to make small, gradual changes to anything, whether it be mechanics or programming. At the same time, you have to take into account the other things that are going on in your training or life, because a lack of recovery can open a trainee up to small injuries like my popliteal strain. This is why when I climbed a 9,712 ft mountain last Saturday, I rested for three total days before snatching and CJing up to my month’s goals (more on this in a later post).</p>
<p>As for your injury, Nic, I suggest icing it as much as you can for the first several days. Mob the upper calf area with compression tack and stretch (you can do this above the knee as well) or joint capsule work with a rolled up towel tucked inside the back of the knee while in knee flexion (<a href="http://youtu.be/OuJ8NrMJj10?t=4m41s" target="_blank">kind of like this vid</a>). Ease back into squatting with light, medium, and then heavy days.</p>

  for some background, i’m 20, 5’8″ 195lbs with 15%bf. ive been lifting since high school, and it was always for football performance, so it was mostly the power lifts and just power cleans, with football conditioning. after high school i started learning the oly lifts. i’ve been doing them for about a year now, still not the best mechanics and deffinately not with a lot of weight, but i really want to focus on them because i like them so much. ive checked out the pendlay outline for a beginner template and i made my own up. could you tell me how dumb or smart it is?<br /> mon- snatch 5×3@80% 1rm, high pulls and hang cleans 5×2 (not with significant weight, just to reinforce mechanics) high bar squat 3×5. (recently switched from low bar about a month ago when i decided to focus on oly lifts) pull ups<br /> tues- clean and jerk 5×3@80% 1rm. high snatch pulls and hang snatches 5×2, rdls 3×8, sprints<br /> wed-bench 3×5, bent over bb rows 3×5, db bench 3×5, db rows 3×5, push ups, lower back and ab complex<br /> thurs- snatch 2,2,1 @90% 1rm. high bar squat 3×5, high pulls and hang snatches, press 3×5 (was doing 3×3 with ascending sets, but neglecting presses for a while has left me weak on them and im gonna just do an LP with them till i hit a wall) chins, if i have time ill do a bb complex<br /> fri- c and j 2,2,1 @90% 1rm, high snatch pull and hang snatches, deads 1×5, dips, sled pullslooking at it, it seems like a lot. maybe it is. i havent been able to actually do this program for longer than two weeks uninterrupted due to travel and vacation, but it hasnt been too much to handle for the time ive been able to do it. i feel like i can do this template, but if it seems like im gonna drive my dick into the ground just let me know.

    Dear Alphinitis,
  </p>
  <p>
    You&#8217;ve been reading the site and commenting for a long time, so this is why I&#8217;m dealing with your long-ass, messy question. By the way, someone made fun of you for posting your BF%, but I think that is relevant information, so ignore that person.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#8217;m not going to dissect your program fully. But I&#8217;ll give you some of my personal philosophy with programming Olympic weightlifting. I don&#8217;t typically like partial movements for beginners. This means pulls, lifts from the hang, or from boxes. I agree with Pendlay that the positions are incredibly important, and these partial lifts may develop those, but I think it over complicates things for a beginner. Not to mention, in my opinion, they just need time to do the full lifts over and over with at least okay positioning (this would grade them out at a &#8220;B&#8221;). Instead, you are getting reps with tons of partial movements that may or may not be correct to begin with. I&#8217;d rather you just do the full lifts.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t like to think in terms of percentages until the mid to late stage intermediate programming of anything. Modern society wants to be told exactly what to do, but programming is more organic than that. Doing whatever for a percentage may be the optimal stress in a given week, but who is to say that it will be several weeks from now? Or the first several weeks of a program? That&#8217;s why I indicated a steady progression in the program earlier this week.
  </p>
  <p>
    You also have a day in which you bench, and then the next day you are snatching. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever benched heavy and then snatched heavy (I&#8217;ve done this in a session), but it&#8217;s not good. Not good at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    By my count, you&#8217;re aiming to train five days a week. You already know I&#8217;m not a fan of that, <em>especially</em> for someone in your position that is transitioning into weightlifting. Rest is important to recover and get stronger from compound movements that impart a systemic stress. You are young, but I&#8217;d rather you learn this lesson now instead of doing it the hard way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, I see a bunch of random shit tacked on the end of the training sessions. Dumbbell work and what not. Focus your efforts, mate. You already know why, but Ron Swanson will help:
