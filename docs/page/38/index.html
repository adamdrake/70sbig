  <p>HarveyMushman AKA Kyle has been reading 70’s Big for a while. His wife, Julie (hi Julie!), competes in roller derby and also had an ACL replacement in March of 2011. When she started her linear progression, they focused on using the leg press to help strengthen her knee through a full range of motion.</p>
<p>One day when Julie was using the leg press at the gym, a woman approached them and said (according to Kyle, who shits you not), “Women shouldn’t use this leg press with plates because they’ll get big. You should be over there [gestures to the selectorized side of the room] using the machines with light weight and high reps to tone instead of get big.”</p>
<p>This, ladies and gentlemen, is what we’re up against. This is The Enemy.</p>
<p>This is a persistent myth that women hold onto, but it ends up being an excuse that keeps them from doing anything that is hard. I want to review why this is such an absurd assumption — aside from how it isn’t based on any factual evidence.</p>
<p>**1. Women have 1/10th the testosterone of men. **</p>
<p>Hormones regulate our body and our life, yet women lack significant amounts of this very important hormone that creates a domino effect in a complicated neuroendocrine system to “get bigger”. In fact, you can’t even truthfully say that “lifting heavy weights makes men bigger” because there are thousands of goobers who prove this wrong every day. “Hard gainers”, skinny guys, and the misinformed prove to us that lifting weights hardly results in getting bigger, even when it’s the goal.</p>
<p>So why would we assume this <em>would</em> be the case for a female? And even if it was the case for men, women have a small fraction of the testosterone that a man does making it incredibly difficult to “get bigger”.</p>
<p>**2. Muscle is metabolically active tissue. **</p>
<p>When you have more lean body mass (AKA muscle), your metabolism is higher. That means you use more energy when you have more muscle. That also means your body is more efficient at using fat as energy, thereby reducing body fat. Lower body fat also results in a higher metabolic rate. All of this means your body is efficient at being lean and strong, which is what “being toned” really means.</p>

  </p>
</div>
<p>**3. Lifting weights to get stronger with compound movements significantly raises metabolism too. **</p>
<p>Crayola style:</p>
<p>When you lift weights, you damage muscle fibers. When you lift weights with compound movements, you damage muscle fibers all over the body. When you recover from lifting weights, the body will repair this damaged muscle. When you recover from heavier, compound movements, your body will repair lots of muscle all over your body. It requires energy to repair things, and a greater energy demand is a higher metabolism. Of all the women I’ve trained, I’ve never had anyone gain body fat; they’ve always lost body fat while increasing muscle (by a little bit). </p>
<p><strong>4. Why would a woman suddenly become bulky anyway?</strong></p>
<p>I know, I know, I’m trying to apply more logic to a person that holds onto a belief without any factual evidence. But if you’re a female, especially a skinny one, why would you suddenly become bulky if you’ve been skinny your whole life? If you’re a heavier female, you definitely are carrying more body fat. If you accept # 2 and 3, then you know your metabolism will be higher and you will burn more fat by a) lifting and recovering from lifting  lifting weights with compound movements, b) having a greater lean body mass (even if it is only several pounds).</p>
<p>In order to be truly bulky with muscle mass, a women usually needs chemical help (AKA steroids). The women who are naturally muscular are genetically gifted and comprise a very low percentage of the population. If you were one of these women, you would already know (and you’d probably be proud of your physique anyway). </p>
<p>**5. Higher reps with lower weights seems to be the thing that actually increases muscle mass <em>the most</em> in women. **</p>
<p>Perhaps a literature review is in order for this topic, but those of us that are actually practitioners in the fitness or strength and conditioning field see that women seem to develop muscle very well with higher reps. I’ve heard of various people (including Robb Wolf) talk about how this seems to stimulate growth hormone. It’s an observation I’ve had for a while, because when you look at fitness/figure competitors and CrossFitters, they carry more muscle than average. The commonality in training is doing higher amounts of volume for sets of higher reps.</p>
<p>I’ve pointed out in the past (can’t find the post) that a good program for a girl who wants definition in her musculature is to strength train, then do some back-off work like walking lunges and leg curls to accumulate reps and volume. That’s what the gals do who get paid to do it. The point is that the method of training that women typically use (lower weights, higher reps) to avoid “getting bulky” is actually what helps stimulate lean body mass gain anyway. It’s just that they are doing it with three pound dumbbells instead of 50 pound dumbbells. Getting stronger is the key to metabolic activity, lower body fat, and being a kick ass woman.</p>
<p><strong>The truth is</strong> that none of this really matters. I could keep going with a list of bullets 50 items long. Facts or statements are just a hodge podge of information that won’t sway an emotional belief. Some of you can print posts out like this and show it to your clients, spouses, or friends and they may take action. I don’t expect that to work in non-gym environments (i.e. It’s easier to convince a woman who is doing CrossFit than someone who lives and dies on the elliptical). Instead I’ll take the Robb Wolf approach and say, “Just try it for a month.” There are plenty of examples in the “<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&safe=off&sclient=psy-ab&q=getting+girls+to+train+site:70sbig.com&oq=getting+girls+to+train+site:70sbig.com&gs_l=hp.3...353200.355018.5.355295.22.18.0.0.0.12.203.2607.0j16j2.18.0...0.0...1c.CLidJ_epnbA&psj=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=83f80cfbb2267061&biw=1280&bih=620" target="_blank">Getting Girls to Train</a>” series to get women training, but the hardest part is convincing them that the big scary physique that they think they’ll grow is just a silly myth.</p>

<p>Jesus, what a busy week on the site, eh? For all of you new readers, welcome. You probably came here because you thought there were gonna be hot babes or you wanted to argue with me. That’s fine. This website will entertain you (albeit poorly), but it’ll also aim to educate. Regardless of your training goals, there are gems you can glean for your mechanics, mobility, programming, nutrition, health, sleep, strength training, conditioning, powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting, and more. It won’t all come at once, because that’d be an information grenade that would make your head explode (and not necessarily the head on your shoulders).</p>

<p>Every Friday we post about our training personal records (PRs) in the comments. If PRs weren’t achieved, then readers can at least update everyone on their training. Posting regularly means that other people remember you and enjoy hearing about you; it helps them stay motivated as well. Join the fun.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-challenge">Weekly Challenge</h2>
<p>This is where I pose a challenge for readers to complete. <a href="/blog/2012/07/qa-33/" target="_blank">Last week</a> I actually forgot to write something and included a .gif that basically said, “Don’t suck.” Woops.</p>
<p>**Next Week’s Challenge: ** Perform <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-drills/" target="_blank">these foot drills</a> every day in the next week. It should help those of you with lower extremity issues, but let’s see if it does anything else. You can do it prior to lifting and running.</p>
<h2 id="week-in-review">Week In Review</h2>
<p>Oh boy. The week started quietly with a post about the <a href="/blog/2012/07/new-england-women-of-strength/" target="_blank">New England Women of Strength</a>. Then things got interesting on the subject of <a href="/blog/2012/07/case-studies-nerves/" target="_blank">treating very simple neural issues</a>. Then things got kinda rowdy. Mark Sisson linked to the site; he runs Mark’s Daily Apple, an enjoyable website about health, nutrition, and primal living (Mark: Do you ever read fiction? My gods, man!). However, in conjunction with that I wrote a post about <a href="/blog/2012/07/sexy-isnt-always-better/" target="_blank">not needing sexy programming or equipment in training</a>, but at the same time making a point about superficial websites that focus on selling “sexy” things, like pictures, slogans, memes, or catchy phrases instead of content with substance. The following day I pissed off a bunch of runners because <a href="/blog/2012/07/marathons-are-yawn/" target="_blank">I’m not impressed with completing a marathon</a>. I’ll be honest, I only read the first half of the 80 or so comments. I get bored of the same, “Well, why don’t YOU do a marathon, tough guy,” comments over and over, which only prove my original point. I don’t enjoy <a href="/justin/index.php/2012/07/12/im-offended/" target="_blank">people who get offended easily</a>.</p>
<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p>This is the one day of the week where I pick a few questions from the Facebook Fan Page, Twitter, comments, or other messages and answer them. It keeps me on my toes, and I don’t know the answer I have a lot of friends who are smarter than me that I can ask.</p>

  Justin,

  More of a lurker, but I&#8217;ve been following 70sbig since the beginning.  After reading your marathon post today, I felt compelled to tell you how utterly awesome that was.  Please write a history book describing significant battles and &#8220;athletic events worth emulating&#8221; in the same way as you have done today.
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
  I recently bought the TM Part 1 e-book and have been debating whether or not to buy Part 2.  Heading over to the 70sbig store after I send this to you to pick it up.  The quality of information you put out is some of the best in the fitness community and it dawns on me that I need to do my part to support you in this so you can continue to do it for a long time.

  Enough ass-kissing, just wanted to say thanks.

  While I&#8217;m at it, I&#8217;ll throw out a question.  I&#8217;m a pretty tall dude at 6&#8217;5 with a very short torso relative to my long femurs.  Current bodyweight around 215.  Current 5RM low bar squat around 315.  All time best is 360&#215;5 at 240 lbs bodyweight.  However I can deadlift mid 400&#8217;s for a set of 5 (all time best 500&#215;5 at 240 lbs).  Squatting is just a very difficult movement, and anything above 225 feels slow as shit; while deadlifting feels completely natural.  Is there a certain type (low, high, front, etc.) of squat a guy in my situation should focus on?  Goals are general athleticism for basketball, jackedness, but would also like to hit a 400 lb squat in a powerlifting meet.
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
  I recently dropped some excess bodyfat, so I&#8217;m back on an LP for a few weeks and then will transition to TM.  I&#8217;ve read your posts about low bar vs. high bar squatting and you&#8217;ve addressed this in your Q&A before, but was just wondering if there were any special considerations/recommendations for a tall guy with long legs?  Just continue driving up my low bar squat 2x/week?
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
  Thanks man,<br /> Tim

<p>Dear Tim,</p>
<p>As you know, I’ve talked at length on <a href="/blog/2012/01/low-bar-vs-high-bar-squatting/" target="_blank">high bar and low bar squatting</a>. To simplify:</p>
<p>Powerlifting: low bar</p>
<p>Weightlifting: high bar</p>
<p>GPP/S&amp;C: Kinda doesn’t matter, but whichever suits goals best</p>
<p>Guys with your body type — long femurs and a short torso — have difficulty with the vertical style squats (high bar and front) because of the angles and lever arms. That means that you’ll have to lean over a bit more because your torso is shorter. If you have good mobility and “not as extreme” segment lengths, this may not be as much of an issue.</p>
<p>The reason your deadlift is so much better is because you probably have longer arms (judging by the long femurs), and this helps tremendously with the deadlift. Since your back is short, it may not round as much relative to a guy with a longer torso, and it results in a lever system that is more efficient than normal (or at least more efficient when compared to your back squat).</p>
<p>Without seeing your technique (which could limit you), you just need to keep plugging away at the low bar squat. Part of your issue will be filling out the musculature on the front and back of your legs, and proper squatting, deadlifting, RDLs, or other posterior chain work will do that for your hamstrings. It may be necessary to work on your anterior chain a bit in the form of front squats, but if you’re still sloppy in the movement don’t worry about this for a while. The vertical alignment will train a different motor pathway and it’s some times hard for people to go back and forth between vertical squatting and low bar squatting. This would be something I could determine if I was coaching you, or even had some video.</p>
<p>Continue squatting twice a week with the low bar. Your segment lengths will work best with that style for now, and you stated a powerlifting goal so it reinforces my support for the low bar. The front or high bar squat may augment your low bar (by improving the strength and musculature of your quads), but it may be a bit soon to use that. Be consistent, make sure your technique is solid, and train hard.</p>

<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Paul and whoever wants to discuss,</p>
<p>The guy writing the article is just some editorial doofus with arguably no athletic experience. And the piece included several poor attempts at humor. Let’s ignore all that.</p>
<p>To really rank these, we’d have to define what we mean by “hardest”. Hardest to do that activity on any level? Hardest to excel at the highest level? Hardest to win a gold medal?</p>
<p>Instead, let’s just talk about what Olympic sports could be considered some of the hardest and ignore how they relate to each other. I don’t know where I’d put weightlifting, but I know that it wouldn’t be the “hardest”. The lifts are very technical, yes, but all athletic skills considered, it’s just repeating the same movements over and over. It’s been documented that there are plenty of successful lifters that are not great athletes in other sports. In fact, I think Glenn Pendlay said that in one of our podcasts; the American weightlifter is typically someone who couldn’t cut it in another sport, like football, and they found something they could flourish in (let’s ignore the fact that is specific to our country’s situation for now). Generally speaking, being able to repeat the same movements over and over doesn’t necessarily make you very athletic, though they are athletic movements (especially by a novice’s standards).</p>
<p>Personally, I’m more impressed with sports that are dynamic. Things like weightlifting, swimming, and sprinting are all very impressive, but true athleticism is shown through reaction to an opponent. This would include wrestling, judo, taekwondo, hockey, boxing, volleyball, basketball, soccer, fencing, and rugby. Personally, I’m more impressed with sports that require significant physical skills, perhaps a broad spectrum of them, to be successful in the sport. This would eliminate things like tennis, table tenis, handball, and fencing from “the hardest” category. Soccer and basketball seem to require a specific kind of skill set, and you can develop the physical attributes to participate purely through playing them, so they fall off of my list. Rugby and hockey aren’t relatively technical, they they are both physical. They are high on my list, but maybe not the highest. Taekwondo appears to be more skill dependent than boxing (though boxing is technical, there are only two weapons compared to, well, more than two in taekwondo). This leaves wrestling, judo, and taekwondo. To be able to react to your opponent is so significant in the realm of athleticism, and it’s something we ignore in our “online S&amp;C communities”.</p>
<p>You’ll notice archery or shooting sports, while incredibly technical, did not really get mentioned. It’s not because they aren’t hard, but because they are more in that “doing a skill repeatedly without too many changing variables” group, yet they also have the, “not really exerting oneself physically, relatively speaking” tag. All kinds of things are hard, like triathlons, rowing/kayaking, curling, and golf, yet they are more hard in one kind of way than several ways.</p>
<p>All this being said, I think that decathlons are the hardest thing to be successful in. There is such an array of skills across a broad spectrum of physical attributes. If decathletes were more jacked, they’d probably be my favorite athletes. Oh, and gymnastics is pretty hard and has a large skill set and demand of physical capacity. However, both gymnastics and decathlons don’t have that reaction component, and I deem that as incredibly important</p>
<p>If I had to pick one sport that is the hardest, I would pick wrestling. There’s not too many sports that are so heavily dependent on physical capacity, technical skill, as well as the ability to react to an opponent.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>
<p>_Kind of limited on questions this week, but I’m sure there’ll be plenty of discussion with people still pissed off from the running post. _</p>

  <p>I’m getting sick of the runner’s narcissism that permeates throughout life.</p>
<p>“You mock marathons because you can’t do one!”</p>
<p>That’s such an 8 year old mentality. I cringe whenever I see the “26.2” stickers on car windows; it’s just a participation sticker. I went to kindergarten too, so I guess I understand their pride. You don’t see anyone putting a “500 lbs” sticker on their window, but if they did it would make more sense. After all, being able to do anything with 500 pounds requires some sort of development. There’s a huge portion of the population that will never understand what 500 pounds feels like. On the other hand, a huge percentage of the population can complete 26.2 miles if they gave enough of a shit. You can even walk part of it! It’s not that impressive.</p>
<p>I’m almost tempted to go do a marathon to prove a point, but, oh yeah, I don’t care.</p>
<p>Marathons aren’t even practical. If you need to run over 20 miles to avoid something, you can probably avoid it by walking. Or you would have died already. In fact, the storied hero Pheidippides dropped dead after completing his “marathon”! Even if this story was real (it isn’t), it’s not near as impressive as what actually happened.</p>
<p>The Persians were planning an attack on Athens by landing 24 miles north along the coastal plains of Marathon with an army 80,000 strong. The Athenians only had 10,000 infantry to deflect such an attack. One Athenian leader, Miltiades, had big coconut sized balls (equally hairy, no doubt); his idea was to march their asses straight to Marathon and fight the Persians at the pass. Everyone realized it was either a) get their asses kicked or b) try and have a Leonidas moment (which wouldn’t happen for ten more years, but stay focused). The Athenians marched up to Marathon to find 80,000 assholes camping in the plains.</p>
<p>“We are so fucked,” the Athenians thought. A few days later they got word that the Persians slipped off into the night to sail the bulk of their army down to Athens. They only left a 15,000 strong holding force. Miltiades, that guy with the gigantic balls, said, “Good,” and let everyone know that it was clobberin’ time. It would take the Persians 10 to 12 hours to get to Athens, so if they whipped some Persian ass and then rushed back home, they should have time to defend their wives and children. While some of the leaders pleaded to wait for the Spartans to get there (which was not a certainty), Miltiades whispered, “We attack at dawn,” and then he put a cigarette out on his own arm to prove a point. Okay, that last part may not have been true.</p>

After three hours of fighting, the marshy water ran red with Persian blood. The Athenians lost fewer than 200 men.</p>
<p>Now imagine this. You have been strung out for several days at the though of your entire way of life being annihilated. A Persian victory would destroying the Athenian government, sell your children into slavery, and rape your wife countless of times. After days of this prospect, you finally unleash fury in a three hour battle. All of that pent up emotion has been wrought down on your foe, but as the final battle cry of victory ebbs away, you think of your son back home, sitting in your wife’s arms. Your dog sits with them wagging his tail. And those Persian <em>fucks</em> are on their way to kill everything you love.</p>
<p>“Ruck up, boys, we’re headin’ home,” Miltiades said followed by swigging straight whiskey. The Athenian soldiers had 7 hours to travel 24 miles in full battle gear. Armor, weapons, and rations. They pounded home as fast as they could. Imagine the pain of each step with their blistered feet. Imagine the fatigue their bodies felt. Imagine the fire in their bellies knowing that every second counted to protect their wives, their children, their city. At 4:00 PM some of the Athenians crested the cliffs facing the ocean where the Persian army was  arriving. After seeing those fierce Athenians caked with blood, no doubt flashing their asses and clanging their shields, the Persians thought, “Uhh, this probably isn’t such a good idea, mmkay.” Deuces.</p>
<p>Now <em>that’s</em> a fucking story. <em>That’s</em> an athletic event worth emulating.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Sex certainly sells. There are plenty of training websites that put up scantily clad women to accumulate traffic (I’ll prove it today with the images). In fact, some of the most popular days in 70’s Big history include scantily clad ladies. The fact that pictures of me in a speedo compete for that top spot is immaterial.</p>
<p>Sexiness also comes in the form of shouting things at you and using cheap tactics to get you to click on a post. “7 WAYS TO GET STRONGER” or “THE 15 REASONS TO DEADLIFT”. Catch phrases, memes, and slogans result in traffic activity, but they lack <em>substance</em>. The same concept applies to training.</p>
<p>Pick a sport, any sport, step right up. How do the best in the world train for that sport? Neat! Fun! Let’s be like them! Now how should you train for that sport? By the gods, we’ll train just like the experts!</p>
<p>It doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p>The best and strongest competitors in a given sport are that way because they have accumulated years of training. They started at the beginning and toiled away to get where they are. It’s foolish to think that any of us can step in, emulate their program, and experience the same results. <a href="http://youtu.be/PpWDFI-bJis?t=2m46s" target="_blank">We can watch Ray Lewis</a> focusing on plyometrics, agilities, and some dumbbell work and draw the conclusion that those training activities make one of the greatest linebackers ever. Ray developed his genetic talent of strength and power as he grew up, and he maintains those qualities. Now, late in his career, he refines agility and explosiveness with a weighted vest as well as keeps his body healthy. He works on solidifying his overall athleticism because he isn’t weak and lacking power for the sport of football.</p>
<p>Let’s look at two examples that are more relevant to all of us: weightlifting and powerlifting.</p>
<h2 id="weightlifting">Weightlifting</h2>
<p>There are different successful systems of weightlifting in the world. To simplify, we could look at Russian and Bulgarian training. The Russian system traditionally integrates variety and periodizes the training approach. The Bulgarian system is limited to specific movements done at high intensity with high frequency. Budding weightlifters will see videos, past or present, and are awed at the capacity of Klokov or Süleymanoğlu and immediately want to do what they do. Whenever <a href="http://youtu.be/ZwYbiZwbkuY" target="_blank">Klokov does any kind of complex</a>, there is a crashing wave of YouTube videos of novice lifters imitating it. The complex is sexy! Klokov is sexy (no homo BRO)! We must do as he does if we are going to be jacked in a speedo and lift more than 70kg.</p>
<p>This even occurs with the top American lifters. The <a href="http://www.californiastrength.com/" target="_blank">California Strength</a> or <a href="http://www.pendlay.com/Team-MDUSA_c_298.html" target="_blank">MDUSA</a> crews will train a certain way and everyone follows suit. What’s missed is that even our American lifters, who receive so much scorn from USA haters, have trained and advanced to a level in which they can actually handle their programming. That means that the recreational, beginner, and early intermediate lifters of the world have no business trying to follow their program in the same way that they shouldn’t emulate stone cold Bulgarian or Russian programming styles. It’ll just result in the lifter doing too much when a simple 3 or 4 days-a-week program with a basic approach will suffice.</p>
<h2 id="powerlifting">Powerlifting</h2>
<p>The same thing occurs in powerlifting. Some of the strongest guys in the world are lifting at <a href="http://www.westside-barbell.com/" target="_blank">Westside Barbell</a>, one of the most badass training environments with a badass program. However, in order to train at Westside a guy or girl has to be exceptionally strong already. They have to advanc enough to be worthy of acceptance. Westside’s specific approach is designed for the most advanced powerlifters in the world. To think that it applies to a beginner crowd is clearly a mistake. Does that mean that Westside, or any advanced training approach, can’t be broken down into concepts that can be applied to beginners? Of course not, but that’s not what the training public does. They see bands, chain, boards, sumo variations, wide grips, and boxes and throw them into their training. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen videos of weak people benching 200 with chains or box squatting 300.</p>
<p>The same goes for weightlifting. Trainees will jump into 6-day-a-week programs and squat to max every day. If some training is good, then more training is better! If regular powerlifting is good, then powerlifting with a bunch of random-ass tools and equipment will be better! It’s so fucking <em>sexy</em>.</p>

First, they are not advanced. You can’t just skip ten years of stress-recovery-adaptation, sorry. Second, they are not on performance enhancement drugs. Most of the best guys in the world are using. Again, I don’t care that they are, but it’s an incredibly important distinction to make when you look at their programming. But keep in mind that even if you <em>are</em> on drugs, you still don’t have the training advancement (the stress-adaptation) of a guy who has been lifting since he was 9 years old. Drugs help with recovery, but they don’t let you jump right into the extremely advanced realm.</p>
<p>Simple programs will always out-weigh complicated programs, especially for weak or beginning lifters. There’s a whole generation of guys out there who don’t make a lot of money because all they say is, “Do less. Be simple. Rest hard.” I’ll point out that the principles in <strong><a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Advanced</a></strong> are still quite simple. Each lift in training uses the same mechanics as in the meet. Work is distributed across the week, the lifter goes heavy, and he won’t use a bunch of weird exercises or equipment to get there. <em>Because he doesn’t need to yet.</em> The last chapter in the book provides some options of where we’ll go with the programming, and those options include using the slingshot, bands, chains, and <em>maybe</em> a box. However, we’re just throwing these new methods in with the same mechanics because there’s no sense in using different mechanics in training from the meet until we need to.</p>
<p>Take a look at your programming. Is it overly complicated? You’re either trying to do too much for too many goals or you’re trying to emulate a sexy lifter, programming style, or use of equipment. Sex certainly sold you something, but is it providing quality gains? At the end of the day, you can’t ignore the stress-adaptation cycle, even if the alternative is hotter and sexier than a simple and efficient program.</p>

  <p>The human body is incredibly complicated. I’ve been through various anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics classes that have given me an appreciation of the body, but being able to study on cadavers was life changing. It was amazing to hold a human heart in my hands knowing that it belonged to a living, breathing person who had hopes, dreams, aspirations, a family, children…a life. To hold that person’s heart, one of the most important organs yet a symbol of vitality and love, was something I’ll never forget.</p>
<p>More to the point, the musculoskeletal system was fascinating. Instead of looking at bones or models of bones and muscles, I could <em>see</em> them right in front of me. The rectus femoris attaches on the anterior inferior iliac spine and travels down to integrate with the other three parts of the quadriceps to a common tendon that attach to the patella, which shifts into a ligament that attaches on the tibial tuberosity on the anterior side of the proximal tibia. God damn it, isn’t it beautiful? Seeing it gave me an immense appreciation for the complexity of life and how it evolved to be that way.</p>
<p>I love and appreciate this kind of shit, and I love and appreciate teaching people to optimally train their bodies to perform and be as healthy as possible. There’s a lot going on when we train, eat, sleep, or experience life. It takes effort to keep things on track, yet there’s a lot that can easily go wrong. I’m often surprised that some people have made it as far as they have; the crack addict still breathes years after being addicted and the ignorant guy who deadlifts with a horribly flexed lumbar still hasn’t blown out a disc. Humans are a hardy species.</p>
<p>I have two friends that have had nerve issues to the point that it has effected their training. Shawn has made his way through law school and still manages to train about four times a week. “Mace” is a soldier who has been blown up and shot. They have very different backgrounds and different nerve related issues that they have either fixed or improved.</p>
<p>I want to point out that I’m not a medical doctor. I’ve had several medical doctors comment that I know anatomy better than they do, but I think they were just being nice. Anything I say should not be taken for medical advice; when in doubt, go see a doctor. But let’s face it, some times we — people who train regularly — do not have the resources to see a doctor. Does this mean you should try adjusting your vertebral segments on your own? Absolutely not. But there are ways that you can work on your body to improve your ailments (it’s the premise behind <a href="http://mobilitywod.com/" target="_blank">MobilityWOD</a>). Most of us can handle the minor repairs in our house; it’s only when there is a major issue (a flooded basement, the hot water heater craps out, etc.) that we’ll get ‘professional help’. Our bodies should be no different. Let’s look at how we addressed some nerve related issues.</p>
<h2 id="shawn">Shawn</h2>
<p>Earlier this year Shawn started noticing that his left hand was feeling numb. Specifically it was his pinky finger and half of his ring finger. When he pressed, he noticed that his wrist felt extremely unstable, especially at the top half of the range of motion. He felt as if he had no sensory feedback, kind of like when your foot falls asleep. Shawn can deadlift close to 405, but when he was doing 315 one day it felt hard, and the bar just fell out of his hand halfway up. He realized something was wrong and had it looked at. He was told he had carpal tunnel.</p>
<p>To me, that’s a bullshit over simplification. The pinky and ring finger are precisely where the ulnar nerve travels to. That tells me there is something occluding or impinging his ulnar nerve, but the question is where? After being told he had carpal tunnel, Shawn was conscious of his wrist position when typing (he was working at a law firm while finishing his degree), yet the issue never went away. That told me it didn’t have much to do with the wrist.</p>
<p>I started thinking about three other places: the elbow, shoulder and neck. If someone is particularly tight in their internal rotators of the shoulder, I could see that pinching down on the brachial plexus and causing issues, but I’d sort of expect there to be some shoulder or inner biceps pain. There wasn’t really any of that, but file that info away. I started asking Shawn about what his elbow was doing when he is sitting. He primarily sits in class, at work, in his truck commuting, or at his desk at home. It turns out that his medial elbow was often mashed down on the arm rest of his chairs or the door of his truck (you know, the “I’m a big guy and my elbow is sticking out my window” style of driving a truck).</p>
<p>I collected all of this data and created a non-invasive prescription for Shawn.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Stop sitting with the medial elbow in contact with surfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete nerve flossing 4x/day (more on this below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stretch the internal rotators of the shoulder and tie in the neck 2x/day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By not impinging the nerve, we should free up that medial elbow and allow the nerve signal to pass through the area. By stretching the shoulder and neck, we could account for any possible tightness in the area that could impinge on cervical or brachial nerves. Lastly, the nerve flossing seems to be significant in treating the issue. To perform it, a person would reach their arm out laterally from their side so that their whole arm is horizontal. The palm is up, which supinates the forearm and slightly externally rotates the shoulder. They then look forward with good spinal posture and gently laterally flex their neck <em>away</em> from the outstretched arm. They would hold for a count, and then return their head to neutral position.</p>

<p>Within a week or so, Shawn noticed improvement in his numb fingers. His wrist felt more stable when training, and his grip strength returned. His fingers became sensitive to regular temperatures of water; they would feel like extreme hot or cold on the pinky and half of ring finger while the rest of the hand felt a moderate temperature. My guess is that because his fingers had lost innervation for several weeks, his body adapted to not feeling anything. When the neural innervation returned, his sensitivity was heightened to the temperatures. Now, several months later Shawn doesn’t have any issues with his fingers or wrist.</p>
<h2 id="8220mace8221">“Mace”</h2>
<p>This guy is a crazy asshole in the Army who has made a really solid effort on getting killed in or out of combat. When his humvee was blown up by an IED, it started a series of issues that eventually resulted in two herniated discs in his back that cause localized and sciatic pain. When he was trying to jump off of a building to avoid an RPG, the explosion took his feet out from under him and he dislocated his left shoulder and tore his labrum. At least the grazing AK round on his leg didn’t leave any lingering damage.</p>
<p>Mace’s issue is in his right shoulder. He noticed that his right deltoid was just not being innervated, and this resulted in a lop-sided press. “Brute force and ignorance” didn’t seem to help, so we started collecting info on his situation. Unlike Shawn, who had no history of cervical injury, Mace probably has some kind of cervical issue that could be causing this. He could have a brachial plexus issue. Who knows? He’d have to wait to wait a bit to see a military doc, so I figured we might as well try:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nerve flossing, same thing as what Shawn did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working on shoulder mobility, especially internal rotation stuff.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before trying this treatment, Mace’s deltoid simply wouldn’t innervate properly (he sent me a video, it’s weird). He found that if he did the neural flossing at home, it would help innervate his deltoid and he’d get a decent press workout. He found that if he did it as part of his warm-up at the gym that he would still favor his right shoulder. Regardless, he still does it at the end of his training session. Despite our efforts that improved the issue slightly, his “shit is still fucked up”. He will see a neurologist soon and hopefully they can shed some light on where his issue originates and whether or not he can do basic treatments to keep him operational.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>Nerve issues are not incredibly common in the training world. Hopefully this post gives you two perspectives. In Shawn’s case, we were able to identify what caused his issue, created an effective rehab program, and completely eradicated the problem. In Mace’s case, he has some more serious stuff going on that is going to require actual medical attention. We can discern the difference through collecting data on our “patients”. I was quickly able to identify what was probably causing Shawn’s problem by critically thinking with anatomical knowledge. I knew Mace’s issue was going to require “proper medical attention” since there wasn’t really one cause we could point to, but I still thought we could improve it to some degree (we did).</p>
<p>In either case, the assessment and “prescription” were derived from a knowledge of anatomy and physiology. I’ve explained in the past <a href="/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/" target="_blank">why anatomy is important</a> for people who coach or train, but took it to a different level here. Coaches, trainers, or “fitness professionals” owe it to their clients to continuously learn about the human body. That doesn’t mean they should have to take bullshit continuing education credits on stupid pieces of equipment, coaching, or nutrition, but should focus on the hard sciences applied to relevant scenarios. I didn’t do anything special here; PT’s or chiros may have better solutions. Yet I was able to eliminate or improve serious problems that hampered two friends’ training.</p>
<p>And it all starts with anatomy and physiology.</p>

  <p><em>Monday’s are devoted to women and training, and this is a guest post from Gina Melnik, one of the women who helps run the New England Women of Strength (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/NewEnglandWomenOfStrength" target="_blank">N.E.W.S.</a>)</em></p>
<p>New England Women of Strength (N.E.W.S.) is a community of female strongman athletes.  N.E.W.S. provides its members an opportunity to share passion for the sport of strongman and build a pathway to help other strong women become <strong><em>Strongwomen</em></strong>.  As a relatively new organization, one of our first major activities was holding a workshop to help introduce women to the sport of strongman.</p>
<p>The idea came about because many of us in N.E.W.S. kept finding women that were excited by the idea of heavy lifting and trying strongman, but needed some support and the right environment to help them feel comfortable exploring the sport.  We knew based on our own collective experiences that a learning environment constructed and run by strongwoman athletes would be approachable and empowering for novice female lifters beyond anything that other strongman or strength training resources could provide.  We started talking about the possibility of a strongman workshop for beginners and there was immediate excitement from prospective workshop takers.  Three of N.E.W.S.’s more experienced strongman competitors – Gina Cravedi, Kim Berg and me (Gina Melnik) — decided to make it happen and formed a coaching team for the workshop.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/07/P1060134.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7284" data-permalink="/blog/2012/07/new-england-women-of-strength/p1060134/" data-orig-file="/2012/07/P1060134.jpg" data-orig-size="800,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.9&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;DMC-G1&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1339930818&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="P1060134" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/07/P1060134-200x150.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/07/P1060134-450x337.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7284" title="P1060134" src="/2012/07/P1060134-450x337.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="337" srcset="/2012/07/P1060134-450x337.jpg 450w, /2012/07/P1060134-150x112.jpg 150w, /2012/07/P1060134-200x150.jpg 200w, /2012/07/P1060134-400x300.jpg 400w, /2012/07/P1060134.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>The workshop was geared toward women that were already strength training, but new to strongman.  The coaching team’s goal was to lay out a basic foundation for learning the sport – the kind that we wished we had when we were beginning.  After a seminar-style discussion, we moved on to events.  As anyone familiar with strongman knows, contest events are constantly changing.  There was no way to cover all the possible events in strongman; we wanted to give the participants the experience of an event-based training day and provide some initial instruction.  The coaching team considered a range of factors and ended up selecting Viking press, tire flipping, car deadlifting (with the apparatus weighted with heavy tires), and farmer’s walks.  It was fun to watch the participants rally around supporting each and pushing through on hard sets.  We then wrapped up the day with more discussion and Q&amp;A.  This second discussion session was one of my favorite parts of the workshop because everyone’s initial nerves had dissipated and it really felt like what N.E.W.S. <em>is</em> — a community of athletes exploring their potential together.</p>
<p>The women that attended were wonderful to work with — they showed up enthusiastic, and ready and willing to step out of their comfort zones.  I know that some of them had hesitations about being ready to step up into something like this and it was fun for our coaching team to show them that they were.  As one of my coaching mentors is fond of saying, “ready is willing and willing is ready.”</p>

<p>Participants loved that this workshop was not just <em>for</em> women, but also <em>taught by</em> strongwoman athletes.  All of us on the coaching team have full-time jobs outside the fitness industry showing that everyday women can do this.  And because we vary in size and build, it helps illustrate that this sport can be accessible to anyone.  In a number of ways, the participants could relate to us.  Additionally, there is something about having experienced strong women present, modeling strength, and sharing their own accomplishment in the sport that is uniquely motivating to other female athletes.  On the instructor side, our coaching team was able to reflect back on our own past experience as novice strongwomen and use that as a guide to provide the right atmosphere, tone and support.  We could relate to them and where they’re at this stage of exploring the sport.</p>
<p>It was a wildly successful endeavor and I think all of us – both athlete participants and coaches — are still feeling energized and looking forward to what’s next.</p>
<p>You can learn more about N.E.W.S. through their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NewEnglandWomenOfStrength" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>—–</p>
<p><em>I think that one of the most important things that the N.E.W.S. instructors do is show that anyone can participate and compete in this sport. By setting the example AND providing an avenue for beginners, they make it accessible and fun. What do you think? Are there any other women lifting groups out there?</em></p>

<p>Join the fun and post your training PR’s and updates to the comments. I PR’d by driving 2,000 miles across the country (4 days of driving) — I do not recommend this. If there was ever a time to learn a lesson from Justin doing something stupid, it is now. Pay someone else to move yo’ shit. It continued to destroy my lifting (travelling and GoRuck Challenge started that), reduced my food intake, ruined my sleeping ability, and annihilated my mobility. Pay someone else to move your stuff, trust me.</p>

<p>Last weekend the site theme was updated. This was long over due and something I have been working off-and-on. Thanks to Nick and Lucas (readers of the site) at <a href="http://nytrixmedia.com/" target="_blank">Nytrix Media</a>. If you have web design needs, then hit these fellas up. There will be a few more modifications, but the main updates are a better menu system and threaded comments. The threaded comments will allow for more seamless conversations.</p>
<p>Monday was a quick post on Beverly Crawford’s <a href="/blog/2012/07/big-squat/" target="_blank">big squatting ability</a>, but she also pulls some heavy weight. Tuesday was a <a href="/blog/2012/07/belts-redux/" target="_blank">quick post I wrote at 3AM</a> (was travelling) about some of the concepts I teach at the seminars about belts, and it turned out to be a hot little number. Wednesday was the 4th of July, and <a href="/blog/2012/07/independence-day/" target="_blank">I posted the Declaration of Independence</a> (mandatory reading). Thursday was a blast from the past; I put up a story <a href="/blog/2012/07/an-adventure/" target="_blank">Jacob Cloud wrote in 2009</a> to which he responded, “Aww shucks. Thanks, Justin.

<p><em>Willey asks:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin,</p>
<p>I started training a female friend of mine recently with a program formatted similar to SS, and she’s progressing nicely, but I can’t seem to fix one problem with her high bar squat form. I rewatched your hypermobility and toe angle videos, as well as the post on Navicular Drop, but I still can’t find the answer I’m looking for. When she squats, her knees go equal to or outside her toes, but at the same time she gets navicular drop. This happens with a toe angle of 10-15 degrees, no matter the stance width. I can’t figure out how to cue her to put the weight on the outside of her feet to keep her arch from collapsing inwards, and she doesn’t seem to have the mind-muscle connection to find out on her own. I checked how she walks, and she doesn’t walk duck footed, nor does she have flat arches. She just can’t seem to put weight on the outside of her feet, even with just the bar on her back. While locked out it is still there slightly. But because she is so flexible, simply pushing her knees out with a more forward toe angle doesn’t fix the navicular drop like it has in some of my male friends I train.</p>
<p>So how the hell do I help this? I’d hate to have her roll her ankle inwards mid-squat because of not being able to keep the weight on the middle/outside of her foot. Any advice/cues is appreciated. Or if you have other reading/videos for me to watch. If needed I can provide more info and/or take a video of her on friday and send it to you, as I didn’t think of that until now. She’s finished 105 3×5 today, at a weight of 115 if that matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Willey,</p>
<p>Standard preface: I’d have to see it. Usually I can fix any for issues within seconds, but it gets weird when doing it over the internet, especially without video.</p>
<p>Regardless of the “amount of mobility” in a lifter, they can still have their knees shoved out while having a collapsed arch and ankle. The concept to try is to squat on the outer part of the foot. If the lifter focuses their weight on the outer third of their foot while properly externally rotating (but not doing so too far), then it can help distribute the force across the lateral thigh musculature (front and back). She may even feel more action in her lateral glutes and quads when doing this. Standard coaching procedure teaches the concept, then whittles it down to a cue. The cue can be “outside of foot”.</p>
<p>Note that this may require a drop in weight, because if she has progressed with a technique that allows inefficiency, her musculature may not be able to apply the force to use proper technique. Use the cue throughout the warm-ups and see how she fares while approaching work-set weight. If it gets sloppy, pull it back. It’s better for her to get the accumulated work with the correct technique than push the weight superfluously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew G.,</p>
<p>Justin, I have a question you might find interesting. I am in Physical Therapy school, and because of the stress and long hours I have lost some muscle and weight. I want to keep doing Olympic lifting, but I need to gain back some muscle, too. I only have time for three or four ~1 hour workouts per week. I am 33 years old, squat two or three times a week, don’t stretch or do mobility, and have a little better than typical student diet. In terms of programming, what do you recommend?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Andrew,</p>
<p>Good to hear from you again. You are in a unique situation, but at least you have some time from training. I think that you need to make it mandatory to do some mobility. If you plan it out before you get to the gym, you should be able to complete several good mobs in ten minutes of time every session. Given the fact that you are in a rigorous school that probably has a lot of time sitting down, I would always always always open up your anterior hip and external rotators. That leaves three other main categories that can have an effect on your Oly lifting: thoracic spine, ankles, and shoulders. We’ll come back to mobility in a second.</p>
<p>You have lost some muscle, and that’s a bummer. What I’m about to say will sound crazy to an Oly lifter, but I think you should have some pressing and rowing thrown back into your program. The strength movements will allow the eccentric/concentric with optimal loads to help you grow some muscle back compared to a Oly-focused approach. Not to whore myself out, but I would suggest <a href="/blog/2010/02/getting-into-weightlifting-part-3/" target="_blank">this Oly template I made</a> a few years ago. It’s more so geared to novice and weak trainees who want to work on their Oly lifting but still get stronger. I’d clear you to do whatever weights you wanted on the snatch and CJ days. The first “strength day” I would have you do barbell rows, the second I would have you do RDL’s (instead of deadlifts). I would still have you bench, even though you’ll get angry, but all I can say is that Klokov benches and he has rippling striations that make the womenz swoon. If you do this, you’ll still get to do your favorite stuff (the Oly lifting), but you’ll get good work in to build back some lean body mass.</p>
<p>As for the sessions, I’d have you do 10 to 15 minutes of mobility (this is mandatory) and then complete the workout. If you don’t really “care” about the presses, they could always be completed kind of quick if your squats took too long, and even heavy rows or RDL’s at 3 sets of 5 can be completed in about five minutes if necessary. 45 minutes is plenty of time to get that strength work in, and you should be good on your Oly lifts if you keep the tempo high. I wouldn’t even worry about hitting maximum loads on the Oly lifts for a few weeks. Let yourself adjust to the schedule and program, lift on a clock if necessary and get crisp reps above 80 to 85% if you can.</p>
<p>Do your best to eat plenty of quality meat, fats, and potatoes. Try and sleep as much as you can and consider the standard paleo supplements (vitamin D, fish oil, maybe magnesium and zinc). This will fuel your training, but it’ll make you sharp for school. Knock this shit out of the park, man. When you’re tired or not wanting to train or study, focus your mind. What do you want to be? A piece of shit PT who covers his ass and does the minimum? Or a PT who goes the extra mile for his clients and not only gets them functioning, but helps them perform better than before their first visit? Do you want to be skinny, weak, and strung out at your graduating ceremony? Or do you want to be confident, jacked, and naked underneath your robe? The choice is yours, now go kick some fucking ass.</p>

<p>Chris B. asks,</p>
<p>Hey Justin,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Should there be any shrugging up to hold the rack position for front squats?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much elbow flare is too much on overhead press?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Chris,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Negative. Thinking about shrugging is just going to complicate it for you. Think “elbows up and in”. By bringing the elbows in, it will externally rotate the shoulder which promotes thoracic extension (the opposite, internal rotation, will promote thoracic flexion). If you have long forearms, you may need a bit of a wider grip. This position is extremely dependent on mobility, so work on overall <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-211-the-simple-five-way-shoulder.html" target="_blank">shoulder</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2j1cGdFAhM&#038;feature=plcp" target="_blank">thoracic</a> mobility if you have issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not sure if troll? Without a dynamometer, I can’t really quantify the degree of internal or external rotation on a press. “Flaring the elbows” is “internal rotation”. Keeping the elbows in is “external rotation”. An easy visual cue, if you lift in a rack or with squat stands, is to aim your elbows at the posts throughout the movement. Of course you need to have a good pressing position to start with, but that’ll take too long to explain here. “Elbows under wrists” often helps the external rotation in the press or bench because it makes sure the full belly of the triceps is involved (the triceps involvement is significantly reduced while in internal rotation on the presses).</p>

<p>Dan C. asks,</p>
<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>How good is “Anatomy without a scalpel” for kinesiology purposes? I’m struggling understanding stuff like anterior/posterior shear forces, moment of intertia and general shit like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Dan,</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Without-Scalpel-Dr-Kilgore/dp/0615390722" target="_blank">Anatomy Without A Scalpel</a>” is a very good book, as is anything that Dr. Lon Kilgore puts out (and I mean that objectively, not just because he’s a friend). The book’s sole purpose is to teach fitness professionals about anatomy and how it functions with mechanics. I’m actually going to read it again after I finish a few other books for a refresher.</p>
<p>Kilgore is an excellent artist and draws all of the pictures. I’m actually a subject in some of the pictures, so if you want to see a skinnier version of me with my shirt off, then jump on that. I also squat my dog Leda. Aside from the detailed images, things are explained very well and it will compound on whatever other anatomy knowledge you’re involved in.</p>

  <p>I haven’t had internet access for several days so I decided to pull this post out of the archives for all of the newer readers. Jacob Cloud sent me this email in 2009 and I read it before going to bed every night.</p>

<p>Justin,</p>
<p>For the month of May, I have rocked a rockin’ mustache. I thank the 70sbig contest for this. So naturally, I felt it would be only appropriate to go out on the last day of the month and snag some pictures to try and capture the awesomeness that is my ‘stache, and to share them with you. I did not expect to have a story…it just sorta happened. Hope you’re bored.</p>
<p>After a full day of lifting at the gym, setting PRs, and tossing around a few tons of sand and bricks while helping a friend build a patio, I drove over to a buddy’s place. After another quick workout in his garage gym, we grabbed the camera gear out of the truck and I went inside to change. This is when things began to go “wtf.” My phone fell out of my bag of crap, directly into a drainage ditch. This is not cool, because without my phone, I can’t play solitaire between sets at the gym. Naturally, I ripped off the manhole cover, dove in after it, and recovered the stupid thing.</p>

<p>I had to make sure the damn phone worked before I felt it deserved to stay out of the sewers, so I made a few calls to some hot 70sbig-friendly ladies. The phone worked, though I was a little upset none of them answered.</p>

<p>The phone survived the fall, and subsequent recovery, but unfortunately, my evening light was fading quickly. Angry as hell, I decided to toss my truck in the air as a back-off set for my awesome day. Donning my lifting belt and grunting loudly enough to scare the neighbors, I proceeded. Naturally, my roommate grabbed her camera and captured this amazing feat of strength.</p>

<p>Satisfied with my conquests, I was much happier. I shared the moment with Floyd, my truck, and it was such a beautiful moment that the skies opened up and photoshopped a photo worthy of a magazine cover as we pondered our next conquests.</p>

<p>Given our good looks, charm, and my mustache, it should be no surprise that we picked up a little filly to join us. The fact that it was my roommate is immaterial. I insisted on telling her about the time I threw a football “over those mountains.” She was, of course, impressed.</p>

<p>The end. I hope you enjoyed my story, and pictures. I know it’s probably too late for the contest, but I was entertained enough that I thought I’d send these your way. Don’t care if they make it to the site, just have a good laugh, and keep lifting heavy shit. I’m gonna keep rocking this fucking stache, that’s all I know.</p>

  <p>As you celebrate traditions with friends and family, take a few minutes to reflect on the impact of this day. It’s more than just historical significance; it represents the foundation of our liberty, our freedom. Many complain about the state or future of our country, yet the United States of America is a wonderful place to live. Read The Declaration of Independence below, reflect, and then enjoy your day.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.si.edu/encyclopedia_si/nmah/images/banner.jpg" class="aligncenter" width="309" height="275" /></p>
<p><strong>IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.</strong></p>
<p>The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
<p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>
<p>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>

  <p>I just finished my third day of driving, so don’t expect the great American novel. I’ve been listening to a lot of the Paleo Solution Podcast with Robb Wolf and Greg Everett. It’s a solid podcast, mostly because it’s probably kept me awake and not dead. While listening earlier, some random guy was writing in about belts. The guy asking the question cited something Rippetoe said about wearing flared belts backwards (Greg snickered) and then referenced ME. But he didn’t even reference me correctly, he took something I said out of context.</p>
<p>A long time ago when I still lived in Texas I noted on 70’s Big how I wore a velcro belt for the Olympic lifts (because the bar would hit my suede belt if I wore it), the suede belt on squat and press, and a thinner leather belt for deadlifts (because the suede belt pinched me when I was just a boy). Nowadays I just wear the suede belt on everything (including clean and jerk). I wasn’t recommending that everyone do the above, merely pointing out what I did at the time. Greg interrupted himself from reading the question and said pointedly, “Everyone on the internet is wrong.” I just stopped the podcast right there and said aloud to my dogs, “<a href="http://youtu.be/Qy-Y3HJNU_s?t=56s" target="_blank">Can’t do it</a>.”</p>
<p>It’s natural for me to get lumped in with Rippetoe considering I managed his gym for a year and half, but I haven’t been there in over two years so equating us would be inaccurate. But I’m more talking about my shame, man, my shame! I actually don’t know if I should be ashamed cause I didn’t finish listening.</p>
<p>Look, I don’t know what the hell I’m talking about. I’ve been driving for three days straight and I’m about to go to sleep; things aren’t coherent. I just wanted to add some information to the plethora of <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&safe=off&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=belt+site:70sbig.com&oq=belt+site:70sbig.com&gs_l=hp.3...1695.6083.0.6191.22.21.1.0.0.0.614.4363.4j8j2j4j1j1.20.0...0.0.PnLAUH-k0Gc&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=d7a50cc02f3c90da&biw=1280&bih=620" target="_blank">belt knowledge</a> in the archives and it sounded like a good intro. We get new readers all the time, so covering old topics will never hurt.</p>

<p><strong>1. Belts improve performance</strong></p>
<p>Chris’ master’s thesis looked at comparing a belted and un-belted 1RM in trained lifters (guys who could squat at least 1.5 times body weight). Everyone, including the guy who had never worn a belt before, squatted more in their belted attempts in this blind study (i.e. they didn’t know what weight was on the bar). Even Brent squatted more, and he most likely aimed to do the opposite just to fuck with the study. The sample size was small (7 guys or so), yet it’s the only study that looks at the performance of the belt as opposed to the obvious pressure increased caused by wearing the belt. Which leads us to…</p>
<p><strong>2. Belts increase pressure</strong></p>
<p>I put this in here because the guy asking Robb/Greg the question wasn’t technically correct. The belt increases pressure in two ways. The first is that it decreases the volume of the trunk. If we assume the same big breath of air (same quantity) with the decreased volume, Boyle’s Law shows us that the pressure increases. The second is that the abdominals contract harder into the surface area of the belt. The result is an increase of pressure in a) the intraabdominal cavity and b) the intrathoracic cavity. These are two distinct areas and they both have a resultant pressure increase.</p>
<p><strong>3. There’s a training effect from chronic belt use.</strong></p>
<p>People always ask, “How much more weight should I be able to squat with a belt?” It doesn’t work like that; there isn’t a standardized amount that you can accomplish with and without a belt. And even if there was, it would be an individualized thing. If you accept that the abdominals contract harder (and this can be felt after the first few belted sessions — the abs are distinctly sore), then that means they are trained differently (i.e. more) when belted. After a given amount of time, say 8 weeks, the trainee will be stronger with a belt than they would have been without the belt. Since pretty much everyone squats more with a belt, that means the un-belted strength will also have increased more compared to if the trainee had never worn the belt in that 8 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>4. Belts improve efficiency, safety.</strong></p>
<p>The pressure increases in the torso act as a pneumatic brace against the anterior portion of the spine. This “air brace” helps stabilize and solidify the trunk, allowing for all of the force of the working muscles to be transferred into the bar. This extra stabilization also means that the trunk is safer than it would be if the belt were not being used. Remember: in lifting, safety = efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>5. Inzer makes great belts.</strong></p>
<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://www.inzernet.com/" target="_blank">Inzer belts</a> for their great quality and durability. They were kind enough to send Chris several belts to use for his study.</p>
<p><strong>6. You are not Russian.</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of assholes like Brent who think they don’t need a belt. Hey, if you’ve been lifting since you were nine years old and were given exemplary supplements, you’d be so jacked you wouldn’t need a belt. But you aren’t. You’re just some dude who picked up the sport recently. You are not a beautiful snowflake; you’re just some crusty piece of ice falling from Klokov’s frozen ball hair. Put the belt on. Or don’t, I don’t care.</p>
