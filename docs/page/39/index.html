  <p>I’m travelling; lots o’ driving. Interact with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. ooga booga.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of Beverly Crawford, a young powerlifter who will is preparing for the IPF sanctioned North American Powerlifting Championships (to put it in perspective, it’s the single ply version of what Chris/Mike/Alex did in the raw version at the Arnold Sport Festival). She’s squatting 365 for two singles and then 335×2. Bev is coached by the unbearably handsome Brooks Conway at <a href="http://www.quest-athletics.com/" target="_blank">Quest Athletics</a>. The front angle may throw you off, but the Quest lifters are using the same mechanics as what we call “the low bar squat”, yet note the differences. The more narrow hand placement allows the lifter to lock down their trunk, particularly the lats, before descending. The upward eye gaze is pretty different, but it doesn’t inhibit the emphasis on hip drive. I’ll note that I coach a 45 degree downward angle at the lowest (as opposed to looking near the feet). Here’s another video of Bev smoking the SHIT out of a <a href="http://youtu.be/jC7BWcs1Hr8?t=30s" target="_blank">425 reverse band conventional deadlift</a> and then <a href="http://youtu.be/UYymkMQmWIE?t=47s" target="_blank">squatting 355×3</a>.</p>

<p>The weekly tradition continues. Post your PR’s or training updates. I PR’d by completing every lift in the universe while loading a moving truck yesterday for 7 hours. Squats, presses, deadlifts, cleans, continental cleans, farmer’s, pinch grip, curls, rows, RDLs, good mornings, curls, curls, curls, curls, curls, curls, and curls.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-challenge">Weekly Challenge</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2012/06/qa-31/" target="_blank">Last week’s challenge</a> asked you to “put 25 to 35 pounds in a pack, wear it on your back, and walk for 30 to 60 minutes non-stop on at least one day”. When I made this ‘challenge’, it was more so to give you an appreciation of the military. However, in light of my interests in hiking, survival, guns, and EDC, it’s an activity that would only help your ability to “go”. Under any worst case scenario — zombies, nuclear war, the apocalypse, alien invasion, etc. — you will need to have basic survival and movement capabilities, the kind that revolve around carrying your supplies and moving the fuck out. Did anyone complete the challenge? I would expect a report of sprouting more chin hairs, cause there’s something manly about carrying relatively heavy shit around.</p>
<p>**Next Week’s Challenge:</p>
<p>Go out of your way to help a stranger by lifting something heavy. Do not accept a reward.**</p>
<p>I know, I know, it almost sounds like we’re starting a fight club or something. My ‘job’ is centered around helping people, but I help people I don’t know all of the time. I’ve returned wallets full of money, helped push cars and trucks out of the road, picked things up and put them down, and laughed when a girl fell on the stairs. Last year while visiting in Texas, in a 12 hour period I helped push two vehicles to a gas station. Do it.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-recap">Weekly Recap</h2>
<p>On Tuesday there was a quick post on <a href="/blog/2012/06/lady-moto/" target="_blank">obscene levels of motivation</a> from Ben and CC as well as a post on <a href="/blog/2012/06/equipment-matters/" target="_blank">using crappy equipment</a>. The latter post’s comments were full of people erroneously equating a cheap econo bar with a Texas deadlifting bar. On Thursday I linked to a <a href="/blog/2012/06/2012-olympics-lifting-preview/" target="_blank">preview post</a> for the lifting at the 2012 London Games that Peter Upham wrote.

<blockquote>
<p>Justin,</p>
<p>Why do you not program in deadlifts when you are designing training schedules for the military?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear milktruckcopilot,</p>
<p>It depends on the person’s job, where they are in their op schedule, and what the unit requires them to do. Without knowing any other information, a combat arms position in the military has the goal of being able to perform optimally in the job or mission, staying alive, and — arguably most importantly — keeping other people alive. Heavy deadlifts are both locally and systemically stressful to the point that they will interfere with other training and cause a compounding recovery deficit over several weeks. It’s possible to do lighter deadlifts and keep them in the program, but nobody ever does that. The deadlift is an ego lift; a weak guy can pull more weight with shitty technique whereas on the squat, nobody is going to squat the heaviest weight with terrible technique.</p>
<p>In this situation I prefer to use the RDL since it will develop strength/musculature in the posterior chain that will create balance in the hip/thigh strength and musculature (to result in increased performance and injury prevention). Again, this doesn’t apply in all cases, but usually will to guys in the military or anyone doing decent rucking twice a week.</p>

<p>Dear ChadTheMeatBeast,</p>
<ol>
<li>RE: my training goals</li>
</ol>
<p>I work with a lot of military guys, so I’ve been doing some kind of “rucking” (moving with a pack) at least once a week, and usually twice. I used the <a href="https://www.goruckchallenge.com/" target="_blank">GoRuck</a> as an event to funnel my training into. Other than that, I strength train and do a little conditioning to maintain or improve those capabilities. I plan on doing a lot of hiking and climbing very soon, so my training will accommodate that. I also travel a lot, so “training plans” usually go down the shitter. Generally speaking, I have a moral obligation to set the example for 70’s Big readers, and that includes being strong, conditioned, nutritionally sound, and healthy. Aside from the outdoorsy stuff, I may get into a couple different martial arts (probably Judo and an efficient striking art — anyone feel free to give suggestions). I’ll eventually do some Oly meets within the context of this other stuff. I’m more interested in learning new activities or sports, and would be interested in competing in something different in consecutive weekends (would make interesting content for the site).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>RE: potassium and blood pressure</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that potassium is important, but it’s minor when compared to hyperinsulinemia (high levels of insulin, insulin resistance), which causes high blood pressure. This is directly related to types and amount of carbohydrate content, and another reason why the Paleolithic diet is a good outline to follow. If you have high blood pressure, my suggestion is to shift to paleo — and this is completely doable as a lifter.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>RE: lifting question and <a href="/blog/2010/12/lessons-from-a-workout/" target="_blank">referenced post</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I appreciate your thoroughness regarding your personal question as well as your reading. There are some pretty decent things that I’ve written that get lost in the archives.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to pick one particular exercise that you use for the “rest-pause style back off sets”. Typically when I think about using these, they are for the smaller lifts or movements like bench, press, and curls. You could use them on the larger lifts, like squat or deadlift, but I’d make sure the weight is light enough where there is no form degradation on any rep. Like I said, just pick one movement. If you add three sets to every lift, you’re getting 18 to 24 additional reps on all of your movements — it could get to be as much as 70 extra reps. The tonnage would creep too high and you’ll most likely have issues recovery. My suggestion is a) use one movement at a time, b) if you use large compound movements, use minimal weight, and c) probably stick to smaller compound movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_Ad-libbed question I’ve received in person recently:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are skinny guys who are trying to gain weight. We see that online it is recommended for us to drink lots of milk and eat lots of food. Okay, cool, we’re doing that, but we’ve grown fat in our mid-section a bit. Tha phuck? How should we be eating to gain quality weight?_</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear skinny dudes of the world,</p>
<p>To give some context, the guys I’m referring to are in their early 20s and weigh 180 or less (one of them has worked his way up to about 180). The reason that milk helps people gain weight is because a) it’s sole purpose is to make baby mammals grow and b) it helps provide the calories to a person who has trouble consuming them. I skinny guy has done something in his life to be skinny, and that typically involves not eating or training well. The training should consist of a linear strength progression with compound strength movements (squat, press/bench, deadlift, row, pull-ups, etc). Let’s worry about the diet.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to bring down the milk and put a focus on quality meats and fats, eat potatoes, some veggies, and be sure to vary it up. This is just a paleo approach with an exclamation point on eating enough. The two fellas in question have been training consistently for several months, have seen gains in their lifts and body size, do mobility regularly, have weightlifting shoes, and will be getting belts soon. They are students of the game, and I expect them to solidify their training with proper eating. I think it’s good for really skinny guys to use those first couple of months to go all out on eating a lot (they have sent before and after pictures of them eating two pounds each of barbecued meat). Now, I encourage them to clean the intake up.</p>
<p>“Cleaning their diet up” means they will reduce milk to one or two glasses a day, but make sure to eat plenty of meat and quality fats like coconut oil, olive oil, butter, and avocado. Generally speaking, grass fed meat and butter will be better, but you get what you can get when you’re young and on a budget. They’ll aim to get most of their carbs through potatoes, veggies, and some fruit. They are free to eat nuts and seeds, but will put a preference on the fats listed above. One of them mentioned how his training improved when he started eating vegetables, so I recommended they get a standard multi-vitamin. They also haven’t been taking fish oil, so they’ll be starting on that as well.</p>
<p>All in all, they are merely shifting to a paleo diet by eliminating processed foods and trying to eat nutrient dense foods with quality proteins and fats. The thing with skinny guys is that they’ve lived their whole life skinny. It’s not possible for them to get jacked in the next several weeks. Skinny guys have to commit to the long haul; consistent training with consistent recovery (nutrition and mobility) will yield muscular improvement. I always cite the example that if a person squats twice a week for the next year, that’s about 100 squat workouts. Even if the weight only increased every week or two, such a person would still have accumulated a year of squatting and their body and musculature will improve as a result.</p>
<p>There is no shortcut. Train hard, but train smart, and you’ll magically become tanned with your swollertrophy.</p>

  <p><em>My mate Peter Upham of <a href="http://shirespeedandstrength.com.au/" target="_blank">Shire Speed and Strength</a> wrote a pretty cool preview of the 2012 London Games Olympic Weightlifting. <a href="http://shirespeedandstrength.com.au/?p=685" target="_blank">Check out the rest of the article</a> that includes every weight class for both genders, but here’s the 105, 94, and 85kg men’s sections.</em></p>
<p><strong>Men’s 105kg class</strong>. Records 200/238 Total 436kg</p>
<p>In 2008, Belarus’ Andrei Aramnau slammed the field with 200/236, 436 total to set all 3 world records. Since then he was kicked off the Belarusian team for drunk driving and did not lift in the 2011 World’s, but did lift in the Belarusian nationals last year and is coming back to form.</p>
<p>In his absence the Russians have been pushing each other hard. 2008 silver medallist Dmitry Klokov has a huge international following. His lifting attitude and athletic physique have built a fandom who are hungry to see him go one better in London. At the 2011 World’s he went toe to toe with countryman Khurtmani Akkaev who has moved up a weight class from the 94kg class and won Bronze and Silver in Athens and Beijing. Additionally, David Bejanyan at the President’s Cup set the World Record in the Clean and Jerk at 238kg earlier last year. Bejanyan’s problem is that his Snatch and total are not as competitive and he will likely miss out this time, but its an easy prediction to make that he will ascend the space that Klokov and Akkaev will leave after London.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CIh1SNn-nWo" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>TIP: If Aramnau is on form I predict one of the great all time three-way battles for the Gold. At the World’s, Akkaev rose to Klokov’s challenge and made the lifts necessary to get the victory; Klokov knows what his countryman can do and will leave it all out there. I hope he takes the final lift and gives it one of his trademark almighty Viking roars to win the Gold.</p>
<p>**</p>

<p><strong>Men’s 94kg class</strong>. Records 188/232 Total 412kg</p>
<p>Ilya Ilin, from Kazakhstan sensationally won the 2008 Olympic gold over the sentimental pick, Szymon Kolecki from Poland, and Russian Khadjimourad Akkaev, who has moved up to the 105kg class. Ilin uses the full extent of the rules with his transfer into the Jerk, keeping as much oscillation on the bar from the ascent of the clean before scissoring down under the bar to receive the jerk. Its legal because its not ‘adding’ anything to the bar but like we will see in the 105kg class with Andrei Aramnau, it doesn’t separate the two lifts like some coaches have their lifters do.</p>
<p>At the World’s in Paris, Ilin won the Gold with lifts of 181/226. Since his win in Beijing his training had taken a back seat but he is back to fine form. At the Kazahkstan Nationals he C&amp;J 230kg. His rivalry for a second consecutive Gold will come from the two Ivanov’s, Artem from the Ukraine and Alexandr of Russia as well as Saeid Mohammadpourkarkaragh from Iran. The Ukrainian equalled Ilin’s 407kg in Paris but lost on bodyweight count back. Ilin is not as strong in the snatch but his Clean and Jerk is awesome. The most recent developments are that the Iranian went 182/226 at the Iranian Nationals which is a 6kg improvement from the World’s and would have won the Gold there. Artem Ivanov went 190/230 for unofficial world records in the snatch and total at a Ukrainian meet. Alexandr went 185/226 at the Russian Nationals in the first week of June.</p>

</div>

<p>The World record in the snatch is in play here at just 188kg. Anatoli Ciricu won the Europeans with 178/224, Total 402kg and is a medal chance.</p>
<p>TIP: A classic battle between Ilin, the two Ivanov’s and the Iranian (can you handle the illiteration?). Coaching and ballsiness will determine the medals. Do not miss the A session because someone could go from fourth to first in one lift..</p>
<p><strong>Men’s 85kg class</strong>. Records 187/218 Total 394kg</p>
<p>At the 2008 Games, Belarus’ Andrei Rybakou was awarded Silver on bodyweight after totalling the same as winner Yong Lu. Rybakou is the record holder in the Snatch with 187kg but has a notoriously poor Clean and Jerk. He actually lifted in the B session at the World’s in Paris and had the highest snatch in the class with 178kg but finished 7th overall. The winner in Paris was 20 year old Kianoush Rostami who went 173/209. He just went 171/210 at the Iranian Nationals but only placed second behind countryman Moradi Sohrab who lifted 173/216. At the Asian Games in April Sohrab went 172/216 so you know he’s consistent right now and Rostami went 172/211.</p>
<p>Don’t count out Yong Lu. He bombed in Paris after a 170kg Snatch but he will need some good training in the lead up. Didier Hennequin was the home town hero who came within 1kg of taking the World’s in Paris and to flavour the mix, Zielinski from Poland and Kireev from Russia are also genuine medal contenders. Hennequin lifted in the 94kg class at the French Nationals this year but he was clearly just in training mode at 88kg bodyweight.</p>
<p>TIP: A win for Iran and the Clean and Jerk record on the chopping block. Rostami attempted 218kg in Paris but missed the jerk. The Iranians are on the rise and Sohrab has to be the slight favourite due to consistency over Rostami.</p>

  <p>Chris deadlifted heavy at the 70’s Big Seminar this past weekend at <a href="http://www.crossfitannandale.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Annandale</a>. He’s about six weeks out from Nationals and is still coming back from an <a href="http://youtu.be/xwLlWu0kPks" target="_blank">injury to his back</a>. He was disappointed that he didn’t get the double, yet there are some factors that influenced it.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-3CPrpwXyyU" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>CrossFit Annandale has a pretty cool barbell club, some nice strongman equipment, and lots of accessory tools (fat grips, sleds, etc.). However, they don’t yet have a power bar (at least one will be purchased soon, so get off it). The bar Chris was using in the video and during his warm-ups is just a standard “econo bar” that most CrossFit facilities purchase. They are optimal for the lightly loaded conditioning workouts aside from being economical.</p>
<p>Different kinds of barbells have different levels of tensile and yield strengths. Power bars are going to be more stiff (with a 29mm circumference) and can handle a lot more weight while Oly bars are going to be more whippy (with a 28mm circumference). A good Oly bar will make the difference between a snappy or sloppy jerk. In slower powerlifting movements, having whip on the bar is terrible because it produces a constant vibration on the bar throughout the movement. While a power bar will stay solid and not have much, if any, oscillation, a cheaper bar will vibrate subtly. This makes the movement more difficult; the bar is essentially moving around in the lifter’s hands on a deadlift. To add more weirdness, Chris had to use 100 pound plates to get enough weight on the bar. Most CrossFit facilities don’t have any iron plates at all, but CF Annandale has a good stash, just not enough to have 7 on each side (to make 675 on the bar). 100 pound iron plates theoretically shouldn’t have an effect on a good bar, but they will make a cheap bar even more wobbly because of the uneven distribution of load. That and Chris put them on as the third plate instead of putting them on first (I think this would have an effect, but I don’t have personal experience with it).</p>
<p>The bar oscillation was easy to see when Chris warmed up with anything over 405. It’s analogous to lifting with chains hanging off the end of the bar; Chris has to use more force and energy to stabilize against the extraneous forces. I think that if he had better equipment that he would have had a shot at the second rep at 675. Yet he still got a 96% of 1RM rep in and accumulated the same tonnage as when he did 655×2 in January (his last warm-up of 635 added with 675 makes the same tonnage of 1310) — the tonnage doesn’t paint the whole picture, but my point is that it wasn’t a worthless session.</p>
<p>If you train at or own a CrossFit facility, or any strength training gym, take note of the how much a good bar can help your training. It will allow you to hit heavier loads with greater efficiency in training to result in better meet/competition performances.</p>

Do this after training or on a day in which you don’t have any training the next day. It shouldn’t be terribly difficult. As you do it, think about how there are soldiers who are doing the same thing at the same time as you somewhere in the world. Except they are doing it with three to four times as much weight and are probably in a dangerous location or preparing to be in one. Regardless of your country — US, CAN, UK, AUS — they made the choice to do it which allows you to not have to. Doing this will probably act as conditioning, but it’ll give you an appreciation for service members.</p>

<p>I’m in DC with NORTH AMERICAN CHAMPTION Chris Riley, and we’ll be doing some touring on the national mall today. Yesterday we walked around to see the monuments in 98 degree weather, and Chris was rewarded with severe chaffing. He’ll also be deadlifting a lot of weight at the Saturday portion of the <a href="/programming/workshop-weekend-dc/" target="_blank">seminar this weekend</a>.</p>
<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aaron asks via Twitter:</em></p>
<p>hey Justin you massive guy you.. I have all of this happening to me… Any suggestion how to help it?? (<a href="http://youtu.be/JslrFB06wPU" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yo Az,</p>
<p>The video explains how sitting can shorten the hip flexors and a) prevent quality extension during lifting or athletic movements and b) promote a hyper extended position in the lumbar and/or anteriorily rotated hip (which can have debilitating effects when lifting.</p>
<p>For everyone else, Aaron is a bodybuilder down in Oz, so hip function is important to him so that he can a) get the full ROM when training to improve his musculature and strength and b) maintain good posture to prevent injury, and c) maybe avoid a possible weird posture on stage that might make it look like his spinal erectors are less jacked than they are. If Aaron is hyper-extended habitually, it might prevent those spinal erectors from developing fully; this would also have an effect on his overall strength in squatting, deadlifting, rowing, etc.</p>
<p>How can we improve this? The first thing you can do is work on your psoas, and Kelly explains <a href="http://youtu.be/Xcx9P5KFNk8" target="_blank">it well in this video</a>. I would stress that you want to approach the psoas from the lateral portion of your torso (i.e. outside the stomach), because if you just put the ball straight on your belly, you’ll probably just set it on your intestines. You can always double check if it’s your psoas by palpating deep into the area with your fingers while laying on your back. Flex your hip (by lifting your thigh), if you feel a contraction, then that is the psoas. Put the ball there. If it doesn’t contract, then keep hunting.</p>
<p>You’d also want to regularly open up the rest of the hip flexors; the quadriceps, and particularly the rectus femoris, will get tight from sitting down. There will be also some other muscles stretched like the TFL and sartorius on the later side, and some of the anterior adductor fibers on the medial side. If you have a band, you can open up that proximal (upper) hip with some anterior distraction, like in <a href="http://youtu.be/SPpAECK8jFs?t=5m39s" target="_blank">this video</a>. Keep watching and you’ll see the “couch stretch” that I do against the door. If you’re so tight that you can barely get in first position (like I think you are), then just hang out there. Shari will give you some more thoughts on this stretch, I’m sure (they’ll probably include profanity).</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2012/06/this-is-why-we-do-it/#comment-25734" target="_blank">jcfendley asks:</a></em></p>
<p>WOW. Incredible mentality to not quit.</p>
<p>Just a quick question. I’m in the car traveling this weekend, so I’ve done zero searching on this topic. I’ve been talking to my brother in law about how to best prep my nephew for his first year of junior high football. He’s 13 and pretty big for his age, but not terribly strong. Since he’s so big hes not very quick, but he can build some speed if given time.</p>
<p>Honestly Ive never played, so I know zilch about the skill related prep. But I really feel like I need to give him a decent strength and knowledge base as a buffer to injury and bad habits. I really feel like I’m capable of getting him to a good place and providing enough good guidance to keep him progressing.</p>
<p>I’d like to start him out for a while with just body weight movements, help him get some spatial awareness, an understanding of mechanics, and his ability. Then move into a slow LP. Then probably into something like CFFB over the longer term. Just have to get into it and find out what he’ll stick to.</p>
<p>What advice do you guys have?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What resources should I look to for programming at his age / ability level?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When / where should I look at starting the oly lifts with him?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Too long. Sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear jcfendley,</p>
<p>These issues are typically dependent on how far into puberty the kid is. However, strength is still the fundamental capacity. Even if you had a background in football and could teach him skill dependent things, he would still get a better return on his time/effort investment if he focused on strength training. That body weight and spatial awareness stuff you wanted to work on could be used as a warm-up for his squatting, pressing, or benching. You can have him deadlift too, but don’t let him do it shitty. I’d rather see quality RDLs than B- grade deadlifts.</p>
<p>As for Oly lifts, you probably have a lot more simpler stuff to worry about. Can he even squat properly to depth with his knees shoved out? Can he do back extensions and RDL’s properly? Again, it all depends on his puberty development. I’ve had a 12 year old kid who was 6′, 200 pounds while another 12 year old was 5’3 and 90 pounds. It just depends. If you want him to do explosive work, just have him do tuck jumps, squat jumps, or broad jumps. You could have him do some short sprints as well. Another effective thing is to have him laterally shuffle back and forth, then give him a randomly timed signal to sprint forward. This would be my extent of his “agility” or “football” drills, because, again, increasing his strength is going to augment all of his other physical attributes. The football coaches will condition him for football.</p>

<p>Why would a strength and conditioning coach not program deadlifts?</p>
<p>The reason I ask:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So I was working today and happened to walk into the strength facility for a Colorado high school( a big one) with an epic almost Olympic like feel. Turns out it was designed with the help of the good folks down at the Olympic training facility. So I struck up a conversation with the strength and conditioning coach who had built the facility to his specifications(fucking amazing place to his credit) and we were talking lifting and he just kinda casually dismissed deadlifts because in his opinion the slow motion of a deadlift didn’t compute to strong, quick, powerful athletes. I told him I disagreed but I didn’t delve to deep. I’m just confused how a guy with the obvious mindset of having strong athletes can dismiss the deadlift? Does that kind of mindset happen often? Extra questions I know but they go with the overall question.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gilbert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Gilbert,</p>
<p>It’s pretty common, especially in high school athletics. For example, I never deadlifted in high school and only did them heavy a few times before I moved to Texas. We did do power cleans and RDLs, though.</p>
<p>The reasoning is that the deadlift, being a slow and straining type of movement, is perceived at making an athlete slow. This ignores that the deadlift can improve structural integrity of the lumbar and hips, something that will help make young kids faster, more agile, and helps prevent injury. However, I’d more so be concerned with the deadlift’s effect on recovery. For football players, heavy deadlifts are going to cause a lot of local and systemic stress and probably have an effect on football practice or other weight training and sprint sessions during the week. My guess is that the “effect on recovery” isn’t one of the reasons they avoid the deadlift, but it should be. There are many types of programs that I write or approve of that don’t include deadlifts on purpose. Some populations include, but are not limited to in season athletes, soldiers/SOF, and hikers. It just depends on what they need to do and how they are going to use the deadlift (they could be used light, but the deadlift is almost always an ego lift).</p>
<p>Back extensions and RDL’s aren’t a perfect substitute for the deadlift, but they can still get good muscle action on the structures. The power cleans will emulate a pull and develop power, which is important for hitting people in football.</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2012/06/go-ruck-challenge-review/#comment-25773" target="_blank">cfitz asks:</a></em></p>
<p>Any thoughts on wearing vibrams for this (the <a href="https://www.goruckchallenge.com/" target="_blank">GoRuck Challenge</a>)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear cfitz,</p>
<p>Wearing vibrams for a GoRuck would be an excellent way to fuck your feet, ankles, and lower leg up. I figured this was a troll question, but I wanted to address vibrams…<a href="/blog/2011/03/what-not-to-do/" target="_blank">again</a>.</p>
<p>I fucking hate when people lift in vibrams. It’s inefficient (i.e. bad mechanics), and efficiency is the same thing as safety in lifting. It’s one thing to do your “functional fitness” portion of your workout in them (though I would still recommend against it), but it’s another to wear them all the time in the gym. Besides, wearing vibrams isn’t something that is going to strengthen your feet properly; <strong>proper foot mechanics when barefoot is what will strengthen your feet properly</strong> . Most people have externally rotated hips that result in their toes pointing out. Most people have navicular drop, which is a collapsed arch (that results in a totally FUCKED ankle joint). Most people walk around slapping their feet like ducks instead of transitioning from heel to toe evenly across their feet. This has a direct effect on efficacy in athletic movements, preventing injury in any movement (from running to rucking), and lifting. If you realize that you have crappy feet or mechanics, then it will require mobility and strengthening exercises (see post <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-awareness/" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-drills/" target="_blank">two</a> for more on this). It won’t improve over night, and it certainly won’t improve by continuing to move shitty with vibrams on due to simply being “barefoot”.</p>
<p>I’m fine with people wearing vibrams outside; they help protect the soles of the feet for soft-skinned folks. They are effective on the beach, in rocky streams, and during kayaking. First, learn what good mechanics are. Second, start implementing the good mechanics in movement. Third, work on your feet with proper mobility and strengthening. Lastly, get outside in your bare feet and practice good mechanics. It’s all irrelevant if you’re repetitively using shitty mechanics.</p>
<p>And to bring this back to the topic of rucking, only a fool would ruck in vibrams. I would expect significant strains int he tendons, ligaments, and fascia of the foot, ankle, and shins. Shoes have a purpose, people. They protect our feet from extraneous forces.</p>

Millions of people spend hours and hours in the gym without a direction. I thought an excerpt from FIT’s “Chapter 1 – Fitness: What It Is” would help everyone see that it’s possible to define the parameters of fitness. Definitions allow us to quantify, which allows us to program with purpose. Training has a purpose, “working out” is just stumbling through the woods without a map.</p>

<h2 id="deconstructing-fitness">DECONSTRUCTING FITNESS</h2>
<p>The human body is an integrated living system, one that must follow the laws and theories of biology, chemistry, and physics. These fields are structured upon foundations of definition and measurement. Any definition of fitness must be quantifiable. If we focus our definition of fitness on the many decades old works of Darwin, Nietzche, Bernard, Selye, and many more, we will create a definition rooted in the science of physical abilities, adaptation, and survival (9,10,11,12). But what physical abilities are related to survival? If we consider the physical abilities that help us function and conquer the spectrum of physical stresses and life tasks with which have historically and presently encountered, we can categorize them into three basic physical abilities:</p>
<p>Strength</p>
<p>Endurance</p>
<p>Mobility</p>
<p><strong>Strength</strong> is the ability to move the body under load and is expressed as an ability to generate muscular force across a spectrum of movement speeds. Strength is a physical entity driven by the biological need to overcome the force of gravity acting on the body or on environmental entities with which the body interacts. It is easily measured using apparati commonly found in gyms (barbells) or laboratories (force platforms, dynamometers, and other force measurement devices). Strength can be further subdivided into muscular force generated with no body movement – isometric strength; muscular force generated at slow speeds – low velocity strength; and muscular force generated at high speeds – high velocity strength.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance</strong> is the ability to sustain a task over time. Standing and sitting are the two most sustained things humans do in modern life. Neither require any type of physical effort as the body is anatomically structured to minimize exertion and caloric expenditure when seated or standing. Endurance is a characteristic of movement, physical activity, exercise, and sport. Many things we do require a level of endurance – walking across campus, carrying groceries up to a fourth story walk up, jogging a couple miles, and playing a hard half of football for example. Endurance is primarily a bioenergetic entity, related to the ability to deliver oxygen and energetic nutrients to the working muscles at adequate rates and for long enough duration to accomplish the task at hand. As endurance is time dependent, it is easily measured with a watch and measuring tape or any number of other common or laboratory measurement devices. Endurance can be subdivided into continuous endurance, where the activity is sustained, as in jogging – and intermittent endurance, where work-recovery cycles are repeated for long durations, as in digging post holes for a fence row.</p>
<p><strong>Mobility</strong> is the ability to move the body and its constituent parts in a variety of directions and carry out both simple and complex motor tasks. Mobility is an important – but under attended – element of fitness. Stable, controlled, and coordinated movement within our occasionally unstable and frequently unpredictable home, work, and play environments facilitates adequate function and survival. Mobility is likely the most complicated element of fitness as it is comprised of range of motion, agility, balance, and coordination. Each of these entities is measurable in the gym or in the laboratory using simple instruments.</p>
<h2 id="a-viable-definition">A VIABLE DEFINITION</h2>
<p>Once we know what fitness is comprised of, we can create a functional definition. The definition for physical fitness used in this book is simple, functional, and measurable: Possession of adequate levels of strength, endurance, and mobility to provide for successful participation in occupational effort, recreational pursuits, familial obligation, and that is consistent with a functional phenotypic expression of the human genotype (13).</p>
<p>This definition applies to the general population but it can be extended to occupational and sporting populations. We can also abbreviate it to make it precisely applicable and measurable by the average coach, trainer, or trainee through omission of the clause about genotype – an assessment of ones genetic make-up and function which is measurable only in the laboratory. This will be our approach throughout this text. Various occupations require more (or less) of one of the elements of fitness, and sport has goals and specializations that merely emphasize or de-emphasize pre-determined components of physical fitness to varying degrees – a weightlifter has focused on strength, a marathoner on endurance. Each has accelerated fitness in one area and has an average ability or potential weakness in the others. As we progress though this book you will find out how to develop each component of fitness individually and also how to develop all three elements simultaneously – enabling the tailoring of training to any purpose or goal.</p>
<p>One would hope that it is a logical concept that knowing what fitness is and what it is not is essential knowledge before it can be manipulated and improved. The definition here clearly states that physical fitness is functional and that the elements of fitness are strength, endurance, and mobility. It follows that improvements in physical fitness are dependent on progressive strength, endurance, and mobility training that force our bodies to adapt. It should also be apparent that physical fitness is not a set of variables that cannot be directly measured or do not manifest as outward physical performance. Further, physical fitness should not be considered an abstract concept or set of intangible feelings. These things are by-products of fitness – as a trainee becomes more physically fit, their ability to function within their own circumstances improves, making them feel better about themselves. This change is not “fitness” but rather a change in self-perception driven by their awareness of the tangible increases in performance produced by training and of becoming more fit. The perception of wellbeing is directly attributable to systematic and progressive exercise training delivering something of substance and value to the trainee, fitness.</p>

  <p><em>Since Justin was out <a href="/blog/2012/06/go-ruck-challenge-review/" target="_blank">rucking his face off last weekend</a>, he asked me put together a synopsis of the 2012 IPF Raw Worlds. This information was compiled from watching videos of the event, various reports, logs, and accounts. I haven’t had a chance to speak to any of the lifters, so if anything is incorrect, just let me know and I’ll edit it. – Jacob Cloud</em></p>
<p>The first-ever IPF Classic Cup was held this past weekend in Stockholm, Sweden, and it proved to be a thrilling meet for drug-tested, raw powerlifting. Since many 70’s Big readers regularly compete in the American arm of the IPF, the USAPL, this meet is of particular relevance. Perhaps the best part is that one of our own, Matt Nolan, represented us and our country proudly on the biggest stage in raw powerlifting. Since this was an international meet, the international weight classes were used, which is an interesting wrinkle for those of us reading from our American couches. As these classes are relatively new, World Standards were set as baselines and literally dozens were broken this weekend, including a bunch by our favorite ‘Mericans.</p>
<p>If you recall from <a href="/blog/2011/08/shout-outs/" target="_blank">this post</a>, Nolan had the performance of a lifetime to become the American 100kg champion last August just to get the opportunity to go to Worlds. He decided to cut to the 93kg class, which ended up being a tightly contested race amongst a lot of talented young guys. He opened on the squat at 230kg, an easy weight for him, but was surprised to see red lights for depth. When he saw them again on the second, I can only imagine his frustration at the judging, which was to be complained about by many afterwards (especially the Americans, justifiably). He buried 230kg on his third attempt to stay in the meet, but was already far behind his planned numbers. He shook this off and went 3/3 on bench, hitting 172.5 on his third to stay in the meet, headed into his best lift. His opening dead at 292.5 went up easily, and he had officially totalled. His second attempt, 312.5, was for a new World Record, but he narrowly missed it, and was followed by a Polish lifter who pulled 330kg to break the standard. Another missed attempt at 312.5 for his third, and Nolan finished a very respectable 11th in the world. Not the podium finish he had hoped for, but I think we can all give him high fives and watch him put up some huge numbers in the near future in an attempt to get back to the big stage. I expect to see a 335kg deadlift soon, and look forward to competing with him at Nationals.</p>
<p><a href="http://styrkelyft.qrodo.tv/index/30?eventid=2261" target="_blank">Here’s the video of the entire 93kg class.</a> <em>To watch Nolan, fast forward to 193:00, 203:00, 213:00 for squats, 258:00, 268:00, 279:00 for bench, 325:00, 336:00, 349:00 for deads.</em></p>
<p>The other men’s class that was of particular interest was 120kg, where Mike Tuchscherer was the favorite to win. He had some of the most particular judging I’ve ever seen – getting red lights on all 3 of his squat attempts, and only staying in the meet when his final 315kg squat was overturned by appeal. There was some talk of a hamstring injury, but I don’t have details. He managed to bench well, but ran out of juice on deads (most likely due to the injury), narrowly missing his second and third attempts, and he finished 3rd due to a higher bodyweight than the second place lifter, who shared his 865kg total. In the SHW class (120kg+), Blaine Sumner ignored the tough squat judging (he received red lights on his opener as well), ending up with a 375kg beast of a squat that nobody could catch . His gold medal not only crowned him King of the North, but is a huge accomplishment considering his numbers were well below his PRs, and there’s a lot more to come from this monster. I have a feeling he’ll smash a 1000+ lb raw squat record very soon wearing only a belt and knee sleeves.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Blaine Sumner buries 375kg to appease the judges.</em></p>
<p>Other notable American Men’s performances: The US 56kg (Eric Kupperstein) and 60kg (Mike Kuhns) champions battled it out in the 59kg class. Eric ended up with the bronze and attained a new WR DL of 252.5kg (that’s 4.3 times his bodyweight, folks), while Mike scored a new WR 225kg squat en route to a 5th place finish. I assume he was injured, since his bench was much lower than anticipated. These guys are a blast to watch, so keep an eye out for them at Nationals. Alex Tertitski also grabbed a Bronze in the 83kg’s, with an amazing 8/9 performance, including a PR bench (162.5kg) and a WR DL of 310kg. It’s worth noting that his third squat was yet another example of an American squat getting red lights for depth, or his total would have been even higher.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Alex’s beastly deadlift. This guy’s an inspiration to us older guys who compete raw.</em></p>
<p>The American Men finished with a second overall team placing. Considering the extremely difficult situation of flying across the world, making weight in new classes, only to face tough judging, I commend all of these guys on representing us so well. I have a feeling next year, we’ll be pushing for the overall championship over Russia.</p>
<p>American women showed up strong, as expected, and also finished second as a team in the overall points standings (again, to Russia). Sioux-z Hartwig Gary went 9/9 and finished second in the 52kg class, and Amanda Padgett scored a PR total and 5th place in the 57kg’s.</p>
<p>What wasn’t expected was the battle in the 63kg class. Jennifer Thompson, one of the best powerlifters of any class or era, completely dominates the 60kg’s in the US, and has recently benched over 300lbs…raw…at under 132 pounds of bodyweight. Yeah, you read that right. Kimberly Walford has been a force in the 67.5kg class, and most recently won the Pro GNC Deadlift contest at the Arnolds with a 512lb suited conventional pull. Thanks to the international weight standards, these lifters competed head to head as 63s, and the results were epic. FOUR women in the class topped out their squat at 142.5kg, including both Americans. JT created a cushion in her best lift, out-benching Kim 132.5 to 105, leaving it to the deadlifts to decide the champion. It came down to the final pull, where Kim yanked a 220.5kg new world record to edge out JT by half a kilo for the world championship. Amazing.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Kim’s final deadlift to win it all.</em></p>
<p>Since the only way to qualify for the IPF World Classic as an American lifter is to win your class at USAPL Raw Nationals, I expect to see a lot of you in Killeen, TX the first weekend of August, either lifting or cheering on our country’s best, and certainly supporting our own. Nolan’s going to be there to defend his championship so he can take another crack at Worlds. I will be lifting and coaching a couple other lifters, and Justin will of course be coaching Chris, Mike, and A.C. We can all watch nervously to see if Brent Kim clean and jerks his opening deadlift attempt, and anyone who gets a 390 Wilks (for Men, 340 for Women) can qualify for the 2013 Arnolds (and you know there will be a 70’s Big party there). In addition, Nats are in Texas, so you know there will be beer, BBQ, and 100 degree weather to help us all make weight. It is known.</p>

  <p>People ask me, “Was the GoRuck Challenge fun?” I’m not exactly sure what to say. Fun is laughing with your friends, shooting guns, or riding jet skis really fast. Let’s just say I’m glad I did it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.goruckchallenge.com/" target="_blank">Go Ruck Challenge</a> is a unique, challenging team event that emulates the training of Special Operations Forces (SOF).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GORUCK Challenge is a team event, never a race. Think of it as a slice of reality found in the most elite schools in Special Operations. Leadership is taught, leadership is demanded. <a href="https://www.goruckchallenge.com/Events/Challenge" target="_blank">SOURCE</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Attendees show up with a pack (AKA “ruck”) with six bricks (4 for women), water, and food/supplies and are put through a challenging night of physical stressors through a major city. It’s more than just a road march; each team is given an objective of reaching a well known check point in the city, yet there’s typically a catch. A mission may demand carrying a tree, other people, or something special like Indian running or racing another team. Each team also has a couple of “team weights” that must be accounted for. There are rules that must be followed with the implements and with the missions, and if the group doesn’t adhere to the standard, then they’ll receive a lesson to help them remember why (i.e. getting smoked). The end result is about a 12 hour event that starts at night, finishes in the morning, and travels a distance of 15 to 20 miles. Good livin’.</p>

<p><strong>“What the HELL would I want to do that for?”</strong></p>
<p>It’s funny hearing this question from a prior military guy; they typically had to do this kind of thing before, so I don’t blame their amusement. Let’s focus on civilian participation. An event like this does several things. Most of all it allows a civilian to pay homage to the military and SOF units; by completing a challenge they gain an understanding of the sacrifice these guys undergo during selection, a day of training, or a day of deployment. I’ve heard GoRuck Challenges (GRC) compared to the first day of SFAS and Ranger School (a comparison made by military guys who have completed the schools). The GRC is obviously void of complex tactical knowledge and execution, yet the necessity of teamwork under durress is what makes it similar. There have been West Point cadets that have said it’s the best team building exercise they’ve ever been through. Whether civilian or military, there’s no better exercise to test the mettle of a team than taking the mind and body to exhaustion and asking for excellence.</p>
<p>This is why I think someone should do a GRC. For some, it will be the hardest they’ve ever pushed themselves. It may be that moment that they push beyond what they thought they could, and they’ll do it because they don’t want to let their team down — a team that they just met several hours prior. For others it challenges them to implement their leadership into an unfamiliar situation or scenario. For everyone, they’ll re-learn the fundamentals of team work they’ve been taught throughout their lives as the group of individuals complete a metamorphosis into a team. The team is only as strong as its weakest link and a single person, a leader, can influence the entire team. Group dynamics are incredibly interesting, and they are highlighted in the most austere conditions. A GRC allows you to be pushed near your limit in a controlled environment; one that is constantly evaluated by a cadre who will adjust the demands based on the success and performance of the group.</p>
<p><strong>How was your challenge?</strong></p>
<p>I opted to attend the challenge in Washington DC, where GoRuck started. I think that this is a unique GRC location because all of the major historical monuments are visited during the night. The average person will never do a GRC, much less put a ruck on, hold a weapon, and risk his life for his country. The “American soldier” has allowed this freedom for hundreds of years; we have the luxury to choose to do this type of training for FUN. I believe that the GRC allows the lay person to pay homage to past and present freedom fighters, and doing it in our historically relevant capital makes it even more meaningful. Picture this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are slowly walking along the obsidian Vietnam Memorial wall. The orange lights on the ground glow, lighting up the names. Thousands and thousands of names. You have endured at least four hours of grueling physical challenges. Most recently you and your team carried a 1,200 pound tree through Georgetown to the memorial. This task is only a fraction of the emotional and physical stress that many soldiers endure in war. You scan the wall as you walk, but it’s impossible to read every name. There are so many, those that are lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your cadre speaks softly,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pick one name along this wall, one of the thousands…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that name…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And don’t ever forget it…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charles H. Cook. That’s the name that is burned in my mind. I cannot describe to you what kind of emotion this evokes from me. It’s a moment that will always stay with me. It’s a name that I’ll never forget.</p>
<p>I’m not going to explain the sequence of Class 186’s events, but even if I did it wouldn’t matter because each class and each challenge are different. The experience can be different depending on the cadre, team members, city, and implements. I can tell you that we spent some time getting wet; we carried a 30 foot tree log (that easily weighed 1,000 pounds) down a busy street while people were partying and drinking; we carried our jerry can and fire hose everywhere (along with our rucks; none of it was allowed to touch the ground); we carried each other; we ran, we lunged, and crawled; we went through a river and a swamp; we ran a 5k at one point; and a plenty of other things.</p>
<p>Throughout the challenge, the “Team Leader” position is rotated. The TL carries the flag and organizes the movement to try and meet the objective. We didn’t really have any rules on how to do this, but if things became inefficient, things became…complicated. The two ranks aren’t staying together? Better start doing walking lunges. The ranks can’t keep up with the people doing buddy carries? Then you have to carry your rucks without straps.</p>
<p>Our class had 6 team leaders; I was one of them. I had the benefit of observing several before it was my turn, but the only time we made a time hack was when I was the TL. It was an interesting lesson in leadership and team work. There were times when I was carrying one of the girls while both of us wore our rucks (probably about 250 pounds overall weight on me), and our column had to keep stopping. This was frustrating because I was ready to embrace the suck and move the fuck out, but a team is only a strong as its weakest link. There were a few times when I had to treat some cramps in other people; get them hydrated, feed electrolytes, and massage their cramps. There were other times, particularly during my TL stint, where I continuously cramped. The team offered to stop, but that would have delayed us even more to make our time, so they would give me water on the run, and I’d deal with the whole leg cramps as I moved up and down the column, keeping everyone rank and file. Again, being a leader and a follower was an interesting experience, and it’s the reason I encourage you to try this event.</p>

<p><strong>On Quitting and Sucking</strong></p>
<p>People always say it’s mental, and it is. Many in the comments last Friday encouraged me not to quit; I never had it in my mind that I would. I more so didn’t want anyone in my class to quit, and nobody did (including 7 girls). I was impressed with the sturdiness and mental toughness of the girls. I never heard any of them complain, but maybe that was a function of our developing team. I was in quite a lot of pain in the last three hours (mostly because of hydration issues), but obviously didn’t tell anyone that. I routinely checked on everyone, and the girls never had any issues; they pushed on all the same.</p>
<p>I’ve heard that a recently separated Marine quit in another class around 6:30 AM. However, in my class, a guy named Ray literally had no preparation whatsoever, didn’t know what he was doing until the morning of, was completely unprepared, and wore Adidas shell-top shoes (yes, <a href="http://www.footlocker.com/product/model:94651/sku:060337/adidas-originals-superstar-2-mens/white/white/&#038;SID=7111&#038;inceptor=1&#038;cm_mmc=SEM-_-Engine-_-Google-_-Plusbox&#038;siorigin=pla" target="_blank">these</a>) that weren’t even laced tightly, and HIS goober ass finished. Ray definitely thought about quitting, but he stuck through until completion. The point is that a decently fit guy or girl can complete this with little to no preparation, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t prepare for it.</p>
<p><strong>How to Prepare</strong></p>
<p>I don’t post about it on the site, but I work with a lot of military guys, including SOF personnel in several countries. I obviously have <a href="/blog/2012/05/memorial-day-2012/" target="_blank">a lot of respect</a> for them, but I routinely experiment on myself to understand and feel the rigors of their training (I did the same when we wrote “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a>“). I’ve been rucking once or twice a week for at least six months to condition my feet. I’ve been doing this in conjunction with a strength and conditioning program. By doing this I’ve learned how to structure strength training to still make gains or maintain strength, how to plug in conditioning sessions, and what kind of mobility work that needs to be utilized in a ruck/lift/run program. This won’t be a comprehensive guide on the program, but here are the highlights:</p>
<p>– <strong>Program the S&amp;C portion around the rucking</strong>; it can and will jack up the structures for efficient strength/conditioning training</p>
<p>– Commit to daily mobility work; rucking bashes the shoulders, neck, thoracic and lumbar spine, hips, knees, and feet. Learn your problem areas and keep them up to speed; if you slack, they will fail.</p>
<p>– <strong>Progress rucking slowly</strong>; your body is not ready for 50+ pound rucks for several hours. Start light and short, and linearly progress it slowly.</p>
<p>– <strong>Cap the weight at 50 pounds and don’t run</strong>; there’s no need to run in training because it puts too much stress on the body. Just trust me. Some infantry guys may need to run a LITTLE bit in training to prepare for a 12 mile road march, but it can fuck things up.</p>
<p>– <strong>Progress the overall program slowly</strong>; the body won’t be hitting everything full speed with the addition of rucking. Don’t try and squat close to your repetition PR; allow your structures and system to adapt to the new straining stress.</p>
<p>– <strong>Aim to toughen the feet</strong>. I wore issue desert boots until recently for the sole purpose of toughening my feet. I had a blister in March 2011 on my first ever ruck (a friend was, uh, breaking me in), and the second time I had a blister was a month or so ago when I did 8 miles in 2 hours (some of it on sand). The boots are shitty with no custom work to make them more comfortable (blister was on the back of the heel). I recently got a pair of Rocky C4 deserts and wore them during the challenge (they are similar to Nike Free deserts, but the Nikes rubbed on my pinky toes too much for my liking). I did not have any blisters, and the 12 hours of the GRC was four times as long as I’ve ever gone with a ruck on. Also, my feet were constantly wet (streams, water fountains, rivers, etc.), which is the worst thing for blister development, but I didn’t have any problems.</p>
<p>– <strong>Learn about blisters and how to prevent them</strong>. <a href="/justin/index.php/2012/06/10/book-review-fixing-your-feet/" target="_blank">This book</a> is the best available if you’re a noob. It would be relevant if you’re into hiking or mountain climbing (I am). Learn how shoes and socks should fit. I wore dress socks under moisture-wicking socks to reduce friction on my feet; it was the first time I did it, and I had zero problems (other than really pruny feet from being wet for 12 hours).</p>
<p>– <strong>Learn proper hydration and electrolyte consumption</strong>. My longest ruck or hike has been three hours. When the sun started coming up, I started to have some small cramps in my quad (we had to do walking lunges). I was soon the TL, and my various parts of my legs from the hip down tried to seize on me during our movement (have you ever had your adductor muscles cramp?). I later had a full blown calf cramp in the swamp. This all could have been prevented with better hydration; by the time I needed the water, it was too late. I had a water bladder, but I emptied it several times and couldn’t keep enough water in me. I opted several times during my TL stint to give my water to other people so that we could make time. The problem is that I have a lot of muscle mass, and it burns through water like an engine does gasoline. In the future I would have two bladders and drink on them constantly. My last several hours would have been much easier had I done so (I was pretty hobbled).</p>
<p>There’s not much you can do to actually prepare for a GRC other than get time under a ruck. As usual, high frequency CrossFit workouts every week will NOT help. Instead, establish or maintain a strength base, use some high intensity conditioning once or twice a week, but make sure and ruck once or twice a week. Things that I would add to my preparation would be yoke walks, buddy carries (these would need to be in there for several months to actually have a training effect), weighted push-ups, and farmer’s carries. I didn’t have a problem carrying stuff (and have sprinkled farmer’s in my training), but they would have helped everyone else. I can bench 350 and do 50 push-ups without stopping at all (around 75 if I rested in the plank), and I definitely fatigued on the push-ups portion. I mean, when you’re getting smoked with your ruck on your back, you’re supposed to be fatigued, but our cadre wasn’t impressed. There were about 5 minutes where I carried over 450 pounds on my back when we carried the tree, so having some endurance based yoke walks may have helped that. Other than the farmer’s, I’d say that these things are not necessary. Simply add some calisthenics to your training about twice a week (throw it in after the lifting).</p>
<p><strong>Lasting Impressions</strong></p>
<p>Our cadre, Chris, was a Recon Marine. He expressed the GoRuck sentiment that he was proud that there were civilians who were willing to participate in event like the GoRuck Challenge. I can’t speak for Chris or the other cadre, but they seemed genuinely respectful that we would opt to do this. I think for them, it honors their friends who didn’t make it home, but it also honors the guys that are still over there in discrete parts of the world helping people and going after bad guys. The cadre enjoy the fact that we want to do this to learn and appreciate what they dedicated a portion of their life to. They even respect us for doing it, and that’s saying a lot coming from a guy who had “been there, done that” for 10 years. Lastly, a portion of each sign up fee goes into The Green Beret foundation, so it immediately helps wounded SF personnel.</p>
<p>Am I gonna do another GRC? I’m not planning on it, but if I have to do it to get others to, then I will. If a group of 70’s Big readers wanted to do it, then I’d make it there. Our society is fortunate enough where we don’t ever HAVE to do anything difficult, and we certainly aren’t mandated to fight America’s wars. A GoRuck Challenge will give you a proper appreciation for the type of guy that does this for real. It will allow you to overcome what might be the most challenging thing you’ve ever done. It will truly teach you teamwork, togetherness, and leadership. There was a moment when I was walking through a couple miles of knee deep swamp (how they found one in fucking DC, I do not know), cramping every time I was stuck in the mud. A guy named Chris was there with a helping hand every time. 12 hours earlier he didn’t know who I was, but here he was, getting me through the swamp. I often weep at the state of our society, but the GoRuck Challenge and the people who participate in it give me hope.</p>
