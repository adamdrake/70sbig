  <p><em>Mondays are dedicated to females and training. We have a lot to cover this week, including the GoRuck Challenge and IPF Raw Worlds, but the ladies look forward to this day’s dedication.</em></p>
<p>I first met Ben at the 105kg weigh-in at 2010 USAW Senior Nationals. We got along immediately, joked around, and his coach at the time, <a href="http://www.hasslefreebbc.com/" target="_blank">Paul Doherty</a>, helped handle me at the meet. Ben and I stayed in touch, he let AC and I stay at his house when I did a local seminar, I encouraged him to start his <a href="http://alongthelinesof.com/" target="_blank">awesome training log</a>, and I still intend on helping him finish a really cool children’s story he wrote. Throughout all this, Ben has continued weightlifting and got into coaching. His stable of lifters has grown, and it’s been really cool to see the coach and lifters excel.</p>
<p>He recently handled 5 lifters at the Midtown Classic weightlifting meet at <a href="http://www.midtownstrength.com/" target="_blank">Midtown Strength and Conditioning</a> and wrote a <a href="http://alongthelinesof.com/2012/06/18/classic/" target="_blank">really good post</a> on it. I know how it is to handle five people in a meet, and I know how it is to see them have success and failures. I also know how it is to be physically and emotionally drained at the end of the meet because of funneling all of my energy into those lifters. To have that moment when someone you train with, someone you care about, someone whose success means more than your own…to have them finally hit that lift, that mark, that goal that they’ve been working towards…it’s an indescribable feeling. I watched this video of CC, Ben’s friend, training partner, and lifter, hit this ballsy 98kg clean and jerk (below); it’s an amazing effort. But the part when she makes her way to Ben and gives him a hug…it honestly made me well with tears.</p>

<p>Post your mudda crunkin’ training PR’s, PB’s, and DD’s to the comments. Add in ‘yo training updates too, son.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-challenge">Weekly Challenge</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2012/06/qa-29/" target="_blank">Last week’s challenge</a> was to “add in a day or two of conditioning after your training session(s)”. Anybody do this? How’d you feel? Not something that’ll interfere with training, eh? Think it’ll help with regular daily activities or fun?</p>
<p><strong>Next Week’s Challenge:</strong> Eat vegetables in at least one meal every day.</p>
<p>Not very 70’s Big? Where’s the burgers and ice cream? I’m not afraid to say that I want to set an example for everyone. Honestly? Honestly? HONESTLY? I want you banging your wife at 80 years old after you do a powerlifting meet. That’s what I want. If you eat like someone who doesn’t do the “purge” part, then we aren’t accomplishing anything. This is an EXTREMELY simplified way to say this, but: a cleaner, higher quality diet is going to reduce your overall systemic inflammation and allow you to recover better. That means better progress. That means your wee wee in the hole hole when you’re a FOG. Cha-CHING! Do eet.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-recap">Weekly Recap</h2>
<p>On Monday <a href="/blog/2012/06/experiment-for-da-ladies/" target="_blank">I wore cool sunglasses</a> and gave weak-backed ladies and guys something to do at the end of training. On Tuesday I released the BIG KAHUNA, the biggest even of everyone’s lives, the ravishing, the outstanding, <a href="/blog/2012/06/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Advanced</a> book that will remove three inches from your shorts and turn your skin eight shades darker upon purchase. No lie. Wednesday I got to drive all day, but <a href="/blog/2012/06/nolan-to-worlds/" target="_blank">Chris is a champion</a> and Nolan is competing at IPF Raw Worlds. Thursday I pointed out that a 300 pound squat for a guy is unimpressive. <a href="/blog/2012/06/every-man-can-squat-405/" target="_blank">Every man can squat 405</a>; it might take more effort for some than others, but it’s doable. I promise.</p>

<p>I’m travelling to Washington DC to get kicked in the balls at the <a href="https://www.goruckchallenge.com/" target="_blank">GoRuck Challenge</a> starting at 9PM. It was probably an excellent idea to travel and then do it. I told the fine folks at <a href="https://www.goruck.com/" target="_blank">GoRuck</a> that I was going to do a post on training for the GoRuck. I’m still gonna do this, but I figured a post of the aftermath would be more sufficient given that I’ll know what I did or did not do correctly. I’m sure the event will teach me a lot, but at the very least clarify the stressors that are similar to the first day in most military SOF selection courses. How do you prepare for a kick in the balls? You can’t; you just smile when it happens.</p>
<p>I thought it was really funny to see former infantry guys say, “Why the fuck would I want to do that? I had to do that for 4/6/8 years in the Army/Marines.” I get it, and they’re right. But something like this is a test of mettle for someone who hasn’t done it. It’s also apparently good at team building. At the very least, it’ll allow someone to learn or remind themselves what their limits are (instead of doing a 25 minute workout and feeling empowered). Should be fun. Interesting? I’ll let ya guys know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One question about squats – I am pretty sure the answer to this question is no, but I would like to ask it anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would it be worthwhile/okay to do a session of Front Squat and a session of Back Squat (low bar) for your 2 squat days a week or should we just do the back squat and if you want to train quads do HBBS? For example I would be doing… 275X5X3 for BS and 205X5X3 for FS or something this week.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason the shift to FS/BS would be to increase my power clean (which is probably only at 225 from technique mostly). I’ve read that it is tough to clean what you can’t front squat and my FS is only at 255 1RM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear ashreim,</p>
<p>Your proposal wouldn’t be a terrible set up, but I’m not sure how well it would work. It would depend on your ability to seamlessly switch between the different styles of squatting. For example, I can high bar and low bar efficiently, but for many people the distinction is awkward and difficult. Your anthropometry may or may not suit this set up, but it your musculature balance (or lack thereof) would have a greater effect on this. Does a person have long femurs, a short back, and no hamstrings? Then using vertical styles of squatting won’t be as productive. Does the same type of lifter not have developed quads? Then vertical styles of squatting may be good to focus on his anterior thigh to build up his low bar.</p>
<p>Then again, if you’re still capable of making progress on each squat session, you may be blunting it by front squatting instead of back squatting. You guys may notice that these questions ALWAYS depend on the individual and their specific circumstances, AKA their current state of adaptation.</p>
<p>As for your power clean, that wouldn’t be relevant to front squatting since a power clean isn’t squatted. If you meant your clean, then low bar squatting will NOT be helpful for your clean recovery (which is a front squat). Delineate your goals and act accordingly. If your goals were more Oly focused, then stop low barring.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, just make sure you squat.</p>

<p>Justin, can you explain more about how to intelligently transition from linear progression in the press to what you mentioned in your “<a href="/blog/2011/10/pressing-a-dead-horse/" target="_blank">Pressing a Dead Horse</a>” article?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, “The first thing to play around with in programming is to use some heavier weight, but not to abandon old rep schemes. One example is that I have developed an ascending 3×3 and 3×5 rep scheme that alternates every week on the press and bench with great success.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone was pressing 150 x 5 x 3 when they exhausted linear gains, what would you recommend they do next?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear ChadTheMeatBeast,</p>
<p>This is a good question, but it’s so god damn individualized it’s hard to help. There are a lot of factors that go into pressing strength. Upper back strength is a hyooge factor. Triceps. Technique. If you’re internally rotating, then you haven’t been distributing the force through your anterior shoulder and triceps very well. It also depends on the context of the program. For example, if your goal was to compete in powerlifting, then you would bench twice a week and probably only press once. As you see, it’s not easy to give a “one thing fits all” method for this question. I’m a strength and conditioning programmer, not a “do this regardless of your situation and follow it exactly or I’ll ridicule you” coach.</p>
<p>Without knowing ANYTHING else, I’d just have you do ascending doubles in your next workout. What can you double up to? Anything cool happen? Or did you not leap much higher than the 150? How good or bad your mechanics have been will probably dictate this. The following week I’d have you do an ascending 3×5. The following week I’d probably base an ascending 3×3 off of the “double up” workout. See, the “double up” workout just gave me a gauge of what you can do and it hopefully made you not want to kill yourself because of a weak press. It gives you a higher intensity to experience, and that typically acts as a stressor that’ll push the volume stuff. This is an example of how I’d shift you into doing an ascending 3×5 one week, an ascending 3×3 the next week. This method is mentioned in The Texas Method: Advanced, but it can be dropped in other programs as well (people who have bought the book will notice that most of the concepts I talk about can be pulled and dropped in other programs or templates — this is how I operate).</p>

<p><em>Kyle S. asks,</em></p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a coaching question for the Q&amp;A OR just in general. I’m coaching a new trainee in a modified version of the SSLP (rows &amp; RDLs instead of power cleans) and I’m having trouble getting his form down in the squat. He lacks the shoulder mobility to low bar, so I’m having him high bar for now. The trainee is a male, 33, about 5’8″ and 300 lbs and definitely overweight (bf ~44%) He does not have lifting shoes yet, just Chucks (I’ll keep working on that – I would buy them for him myself if could afford it). He’s having issues with getting to depth and I can’t figure out where to put his feet and how wide to point them. I’d like to keep his feet narrower and forward, but he lacks mobility for this and can’t get to depth because of his gut and also his heels coming off the ground. I had him widen his stance and point his toes out, but then I witnessed a navicular drop, even though I was cuing knees out. And again, I still couldn’t get him to parallel. I know a lot of the form issues are related to his mobility and shape (and lack of proper shoes), but while we work on those what are some things I can focus on? I will try to get some video of him squatting over the weekend if I can. All help is greatly appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I should note that we started squatting with the empty bar just to keep his progression on the safe side. He’s less worried about rapid gains than just getting stronger and healthier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally. he said he was having pain in his shoulders, upper back and chest during the squat, even with a comfortably wide grip on the bar with elbows back and wrists in a good position. My guess was that this is partly mobility related but also due to a lack of musculature in the upper back and shoulders to support the bar. Sorry, that’s not a question – uh, am I correct in this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Kyle,</p>
<p>First, I want to point out that I accepted this in the Q&amp;A cause Kyle regularly posts on the site, participates in the goofy challenges, and I know he is. I go out of my way to help out a “cool guy I met on the internet”.</p>
<p>You mentioned you would like to have his squat stance more narrow with toes forward; remember that this will only be the case when the person has sufficient mobility. Read these articles again (<a href="/blog/2012/03/hip-torque-toe-angle-and-squatting/" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="/blog/2012/03/should-i-point-my-toes-forward/" target="_blank">second</a>). I’m sure you’ll remember that the stance and toe angle will be dependent on the mobility, so you’re fine with what you’re doing. Don’t worry about the navicular drop. We more so want to worry about his high body fat percentage instead of his foot placement. We also want to worry about his body fat more than his squat depth. Sure, we want him to squat to depth, but 40+ body fat percentage is a big issue (zing!).</p>
<p>I’ll point out that I’ve never had anyone not be able to achieve squat depth on day one. There are some coaching things you could do to get that to happen, but they are to involved to type about. If he only has the bar on his back, he may need a bit of weight to actually push him down into the bottom of the squat. It’ll be like an active stretch. He needs to get his knees out like a mofo, though, especially cause his gullet is going to impinge his hip (the femur will come into contact if he’s not externally rotated). He undoubtedly has shitty hip external rotation, so work on some basic mobility stuff daily (it’ll help his back, which undoubtedly has issues).</p>
<p>If his shoulders are getting wrecked, then just have him high bar. He’s probably so tight that it’ll look the same anyway, and you could probably coach it as the low bar. He’ll probably fatigue pretty quickly, so just make note of this on later sets (if relevant). While the lifting shoes would help, they aren’t dire right now. Remember, we have a guy who hasn’t done anything. Let’s get him doing stuff before we worry about these finer details.</p>
<p>Have him squat regularly. Have him do a general warm-up preferably on a rower, but walking on a treadmill or on a stationary cycle will work. Have him do basic mobility stuff. Have him hit the presses and assistance exercises. Throw in some conditioning. Remember, conditioning is relevant to the individual. In <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a></strong> I give very specific progressions for someone exactly like him. It takes them from “off the couch”, has them use very simple walking progressions, and introduces them to other methods. I’d probably throw one of these sessions after the lifting portion. The whole workout could probably be done in an hour given that he’s not going to be squatting a lot of weight.</p>
<p>Be very encouraging. I’m proud that you, Kyle, are helping him. I’m proud that he has made the choice to train with you. Teach him that he isn’t merely working out. He has specific goals: to get stronger and lose body fat. He is now training to do that, and it is an admirable thing. If he ever falters, whether in his confidence or he doesn’t show up, then let me know. I’m willing to personally call him and chat with him about everything for a few minutes. I’m good at what I do, and I know it can help him. I’m just letting you know that I’m willing to help that much. Message me if you think it’ll help as a preventative measure (before the quit builds up).</p>
<p>To everyone else, we had a good laugh the other day about not babying people that aren’t willing to make the decision to change. Yet, when they do, and they show they are willing and ready to change, then it’s our duty (as members of this community) to encourage people along their way. We should do it with the skinny guy who is squatting 210 in the comments or the fat guy who is 44% body fat. We’re all on the quest, we’re just at different paths. A reader once offered to let me stay at his house, and said, “70’s Big takes care of their own.” I believe that, and you should to.</p>

  <p>Brent was telling me about some dickhead somewhere on the internet that was making a big deal about squatting 300 pounds. I can’t recall exactly what quote Brent used, but the guy apparently said it was “AMAZING” or something. It’s really not. It’s kinda amazing for a girl to do that, but not a guy.</p>
<p>I coached a 14 year old kid a few years ago. He had hypothyroidism, which means that his metabolism was super slow. They had him on some meds that provided thyroid hormone, yet his dose may have been a bit high. This made his metabolism super high. Therefore, he was a smaller, thinner kid. But god damn did he want to be big and strong — he’s still one of my favorite people. The first day of training, he squatted 95 pounds for some sets. Less than half a year later he squatted 305. I don’t have video of that, but here’s old an video of him squatting 275×5 (there are two more sets, this was the first).</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGM11ZEZxcI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This 14 year old kid was able to work up to a 300 pound squat. It’s pretty good for a 14 year old, but I certainly wouldn’t call it “amazing”. For a grown-ass-man, it’s not a big deal. People have been accidentally squatting 300 for 50+ years. <strong>Every man can squat 405</strong>.</p>
<p>This, of course, assumes a healthy individual with no existing pathology — anatomical or otherwise. A regular guy can squat 405. And when he does, it may only be amazing if he was a weak-ass dude when he started. I’d be proud if “less genetically gifted guy” squatted 405, but I still wouldn’t call it amazing, or breathtaking, or whatever stupid thing the stupid under-achieving guy Brent was talking about said.</p>
<p>What should you do if you can’t squat 405 yet? The simple answer is to squat twice a week and don’t stop until you squat it. If you garner the accumulated work of squatting twice a week for a year, that’s 104 squat sessions. If you do that for 18 months, it’s 156 sessions. Two years is 208 sessions. It doesn’t have as much to do with set/rep schemes, or volume/intensity; it’s just that you continuously get the acute and chronic stress of squatting.</p>
<p>It’d make the most of your time to emulate a linear progression for several months at first, then a volume/intensity approach (like the <a href="/books/the-texas-method-part-1/" target="_blank">Texas Method</a>), and then <a href="/books/the-texas-method-advanced/" target="_blank">tweak it from there</a>. At the end of the day, it only matters that you squatted.</p>
<p>I’m not asking you if you think it’s possible, I’m telling you: Every man can squat 405. If this is a goal of yours, then get started yesterday. There are plenty of factors that would effect the success of this goal, but none of them are more important than just getting under the fucking bar and doing it. Then do that consistently. Don’t lower your standards for yourself or to make other people <a href="/blog/2012/06/i-am-pissed-too-sir/" target="_blank">feel better about themselves</a>. You’re not a beautiful butterfly, chocolate starfish, or whatever. 405 will make a statement, one that says, “I am average, but I busted my balls to do this, so eat shit guy in the corner who is doing wrist curls with the smith machine.”</p>
<p>Do eet.</p>

  <p>Quick post today due to travelling.</p>
<p><strong>NolanPower</strong></p>
<p>70’s Big reader Nolan Power has gone to Sweden for the first ever IPF Raw World Championships. He decided to cut down to the 93kg class (the weight classes are different nowadays in the IPF). You can read his post about his planned attempts <a href="/nolanpower/index.php/2012/06/11/headed-to-sweden-for-ipf-raw-worlds/" target="_blank">HERE</a>; it’s part of his <a href="/nolanpower/" target="_blank">training log</a>. The stream for the meet is in the post, and he lifts some time on Friday. Good luck, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Criley</strong></p>
<p>I just learned this morning that Chris is now considered the first place winner in the 120+ weight class from the 2012 NAPF Raw Challenge that occurred at The Arnold Sports Festival in March. This means that he won his first international IPF meet, and it also means he is the North American Champion! The guy who won the weight class tested positive for some kind of PED, so he was disqualified.</p>
<p>To celebrate, here is a video of how Chris trains bench press:</p>

<p>In case you missed them in the Facebook/Twitter feeds, here are some videos of Mike and Chris training recently. Mike squats 530×3 pretty easily and then reverse band deadlifts 615×6; Chris rack pulls up to 675×3 about a month and a half after injuring his lower back. Oh, and <a href="http://youtu.be/-NdU8h0Nrd4" target="_blank">this video</a> was part of Chris’ “rehab” of working back into things; I’m linking it cause Mike says something funny at the end.</p>

  <p>The wait is finally over…</p>
<h2 id="the-texas-method-advanced">The Texas Method: Advanced</h2>
<p>You’ve been on the Texas Method for a while, and you’ve even implemented some of the changes from <a href="/books/the-texas-method-part-1/" target="_blank">The Texas Method: Part 1</a>, but progress is starting to slow. After all, no program will work forever. Do not fret, for over the last several years we have been learning and tweaking this program into an amazingly efficient machine that has yielded a 661 competition squat, a 705 competition deadlift, 402 competition bench press, and a 275×3 standing press.</p>
<p>The Texas Method: Advanced teaches you how to control dosages of volume, how to structure the program for use in raw powerlifting, and a variety of important programmatic tweaks like “Intensity Day Rotations” and a new template that will push you past your sticking points. There’s 90 pages of information, and most of it can be pulled and used in almost any program. This is the most proven and effective programming tool 70’s Big has created to date. And did I mention that the forward is written by Brent Kim? Now you know it’s good.</p>

  <p>Some females that lift still have weaknesses in their shoulder girdle or upper back despite the fact that they have lifted for at least one year. This is more common when the female is taller or has longer limbs because they won’t have large amounts of muscle mass to improve the angle of muscle attachment (this concept was discussed in <a href="/blog/2011/12/developing-a-pull-up/" target="_blank">this post</a> — more on the <a href="/blog/2012/01/programming-pull-ups/" target="_blank">same topic</a>). Doing presses and rows are good at developing this musculature, but some times a specific deficiency needs specific work.</p>
<p>Band pulls are typically used in powerlifting programs to strengthen the shoulder girdle. Many powerlifters and their coaches despise overhead because it’s labeled as “injurious”. We know that by pressing correctly in external rotation and achieving a good overhead position is not injurious and is exceptional at increasing the strength and stability in the shoulder girdle. My hypothesis is that assistance work like band pulls were created to help keep shoulders healthy because there was an absence in quality overhead work. They were also developed in the realm of physical therapy to address muscle imbalances, which would be the case in a guy/girl who has a weak upper back.</p>
<p>Here’s the experiment: throw them in at the end of your training on a daily basis for at least a month. If “daily” won’t work, then do them at least three times a week. They can be done on the weekend, and could probably be done the day before a lifting session (though I’d avoid it before the heaviest session). Let’s see if there’s a significant improvement in pull-up strength, overhead strength, or the ability to stay in external rotation on the bench or press (elbows staying in and under the wrists). <strong>Guys, if you have issues with flaring elbows or a weak upper back, then do this experiment.</strong> They will only help the shoulder and won’t cause any harm. Remember that most of these “female topics” also apply to guys.</p>
<p>The video below explains how to do them. Cliff notes:</p>
<p>– use a light band</p>
<p>– use a supinated (underhand grip) that is at or right outside of shoulder width</p>
<p>– horizontally abduct shoulders (reverse fly)</p>
<p>– keep elbows/wrists straight</p>
<p>– control out and in (don’t flop back in)</p>
<p>– use 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps</p>
<p>– wear cool sunglasses</p>

<p>Please post your training PR’s and updates to the comments. Remember, it’s the best way to integrate yourself in this incredible community. Oh, and I’m more likely to help you or answer your question(s) if you post regularly; fuckin’ oath.</p>
<p><strong>Last Week’s Challenge</strong> was to do at least two days of heavy farmer’s walks at the end of your training session. Did anyone hit this challenge up? Post your weight and estimated distance.</p>
<p><strong>Next Week’s Challenge: Given this week’s <a href="/blog/2012/06/its-okay-to-condition/" target="_blank">article on conditioning</a>, the challenge is to add in a day or two of conditioning into your program.</strong> Don’t over-complicate it, and no I’m not turning you into a CrossFitter. How intense the conditioning should be is dependent on what you’re adapted to. Just drop some sled drags/pulls in, do some kettlebell work, or try one of those fancy barbell complexes. If you hate it, well, shit, it’s only one week of it.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-recap">Weekly Recap</h2>
<p>On Monday I <a href="/blog/2012/06/tucson-seminar-recap/" target="_blank">recapped some of the Tucson, AZ seminar</a>, but also traveled all friggin’ day (never good for mobility). Tuesday made the point that even strength athletes <a href="/blog/2012/06/its-okay-to-condition/" target="_blank">will benefit from conditioning</a>, and unless it’s misused, it won’t interfere with strength training. Wednesday discussed <a href="/blog/2012/06/training-efficiency/" target="_blank">training efficiency</a> and urged readers to ensure that they were getting the most of their time spent training and recovery. Thursday started as a rant because of something corny I saw on Facebook (it was a picture of a self assurance fortune cookie that said, “You are wonderful,”) — it developed into having a mindset that always <a href="/blog/2012/06/i-am-pissed-too-sir/" target="_blank">aims to improve</a>, but then focused on being able to instill that in trainees/clientele as a coach or trainer.</p>
<p>There are tons of pictures from last week, but the most poignant lesson I learned is: “Don’t mistake a cactus for a tree.” In my defense, there are no cacti where I’m from. I leaned against one to step off of a trail, and ended up with at least 15 spines in my hand. Here’s a picture that encapsulates some pain and embarrassment.</p>

<p>Last week on Monday I rode a 75KM ride to work. Then let work get the better of me and skipped my workouts/active recovery/mobilizing for Tues-Fri so I could go to the office early. My legs turned into a gnarly mass of stiff tissue. Saturday I ran an adventure race up and down a ski hill with obstacles thrown in on the woody stumps I call legs. Ouch. Resolved to fix the damage I’d imparted on myself I started working on getting loose and ended up with my numb quad.</p>

<p>Dear Ed,</p>
<p>Based on the second part that you posted, you know why this is occurring. 75KM cycling (I assume) is something that puts you in severe hip flexion for a long time. Then you went to a job that (presumably) has you in hip flexion all week. Then you went and did an adventure race which undoubtedly gunked you up, not to mention your hip flexors were already jacked up from what you did earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the hip flexors. We primarily always consider the rectus femoris — the big muscle of the quad that crosses the hip (the only quad that crosses the hip) and knee joints — but there’s more going on. The sartorius is a thin band that sits on top, but it assists in a lot of movements at the hip and knee. The adductor (groin) muscles are assisting, and so is glute medius and TFL; this means that medial or lateral tightness respectively can inhibit hip flexion, or a lack of hip flexion can inhibit these areas. In other words, it’s all interrelated. But the iliopsoas — the psoas major and iliacus — are often forgotten and neglected. This is where I think your problem originates.</p>
<p>The iliopsoas muscle goup’s action focuses on hip flexion, yet they also externally rotate and adduct the hip. More importantly, when you’re hunkered down on a bike or in your office chair, the muscles are shortened. They are often chronically tight in white collar workers and cause a lot of problems, including hyperlordosis (more on that in a later question). The psoas is more of the issue because it attaches along the lumbar spine (behind the stomach) and then ventures down to the inner and rear portion of the femure (the lesser trochanter).</p>
<p>The lumbar nerve plexus stems off of the lumbar spine and passes through or next to the psoas. If you have done something <del datetime="2012-06-08T15:14:26+00:00">stupid</del> to make the psoas chronically tight, then that whole area can be a big ball of mess and possibly inflamed. Inflammation or “a mess” swells and usually clamps down on nerves, and this is why people will feel radiating pain through an extremity. My guess is that when you tried positional stretching on an area that was inflamed and tight, you irritated it (possibly breaking up developed scar tissue or dense fascia, or just ripping apart a swollen, irritated area) and made it push against that nerve. The lumbar plexus stems down to the femoral nerve, which stems to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, the specific area where you are feeling numbness.</p>
<p>That’s nice. Now what can we do about it? Start at the origin — work on that psoas. Lacrosse ball to the side of your stomach, and dig in there on the muscle belly of the psoas. Look at <a href="http://youtu.be/Xcx9P5KFNk8?t=2m38s" target="_blank">this part of this MWOD vid</a>. I’d work on that twice a day (morning/night) for a week straight, but only do positional stretching of joint approximation AFTER doing the soft tissue work. If it’s totally gunked, tight, and inflammed, then it won’t stretch until you actually release the tension.</p>
<p><strong>Let this be a lesson to all of you: if you have severe tightness or gunkiness, use soft tissue work BEFORE doing any positional stretching or joint approximation.</strong> And Ed, I could be wrong and you have a more serious issue, but this is what I personally would work on before spending money at a doctor.</p>

<p>I have had some upper back pain when squatting and have tried changing my grip width and bar height a bit. I always try and get my upper back very tight though. After seeing some videos however, I wonder if being super tight is necessary? I see some Oly guys look pretty relaxed under huge weights (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FOFqtia2wLVM&#038;h=fAQGpT5ci" target="_blank">video</a>), as well as some WSB style guys use a super wide grip that also doesn’t seem to result in a very tight upper back (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W_qC1AKNNE" target="_blank">another vid</a>). I squeeze my shoulder blades together hard when squatting, but now I am wondering if maybe that is actually causing the pain I have, and maybe I should toy around with a more relaxed style?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Paul,</p>
<p>I agree that your upper back issue needs to be addressed. It is, without a doubt, a result of poor mobility. You need daily shoulder work in the form of <a href="/blog/2012/01/qa-16/" target="_blank">5 way shoulder</a> to work on your internal and external rotators, lacrosse ball to thoracic spine, and <a href="/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/" target="_blank">releasing your spinal erectors</a>. No matter how much you alter your grip, if you’re tight in this area, then you’ll continue having pain.</p>
<p>Now let’s address the examples you gave. The weightlifter in the video is doing the high bar, so that immediately throws your argument out of the window. A high bar sits on the middle traps and doesn’t require the upper back or shoulders to be tight in order to maintain a good position (I usually just refer to this as the “rear deltoid shelf”). Nevertheless, he is still keeping his thoracic spine extended, because if he didn’t, he’d flex the spine and not squat the weight. His transmission is intact, and he doesn’t need a special grip to do it properly.</p>
<p>The next video of our homie Mark Bell is borderline irrelevant as well because the dude weighs at least 275 pounds! You can’t really compare your body type to his; you’re not on enough juice, brah. Not only is Mark densely packed with muscle, but his squat technique facilitates the grip he’s using. He’s aiming to sit back on that box to get a good stretch on his hamstrings (as well as the suit), so if he sits back more, he leans forward more. That helps him provide a shelf for the bar to sit on, even if we didn’t even consider the fact that he’s densely muscled. His muscle mass creates that shelf, and a wide grip such as his might be equivalent to your more narrow grip because of much muscle he has in his middle trapezius and rhomboid area.</p>
<p>The moral of the story? It’s okay to question the way you’re doing something, but you can’t compare yourself to populations that aren’t similar to you at all — in squat style or body type. All of this discussion means that you’re reading this and NOT doing shoulder mobility, so get to working on that. Get your kid to grow up faster so you have more time in the gym too. Steroids may help, but you’re already too hairy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Justin, could you talk about correcting Hyperlordosis in your next Q&amp;A? Or should I just google it because you’ve covered it already?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve done some research on it, but I trust you, so I was hoping to get your take.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Chris,</p>
<p>I’ve been putting off your question for several weeks because I wanted to give it the full attention it deserved. The answer will be confusing in text, so I’ll probably do a video post on it in the future to reiterate the point. Hyperlordis means that that the lumbar is severely extended because the hip is severely anteriorily rotated. I’m going to simplify this and say that it’s generally caused by tight hip flexors, ESPECIALLY the psoas. Traditionally hyperlordosis was seen a lot in dancers, but nowadays people are taught to extend the hell out of their lumbar spines when lifting and it’s becoming more common. There is a smaller percentage of females who have because of a lack of kinesthetic sense, but I think it’s cause they learned to do to hinge their ass out so it looks better. In guys, I think it develops in a similar way, but it’s because they want their chest to look big. If a guy lacks thoracic mobility (and kinesthetic sense), he’ll lift his chest by hyper extending at his thoracic/lumbar junction and sacro/liliac junction. Compound these nuances with the fact that everyone in western society is sitting down for at least 4 hours a day, and you have chronically tight hip flexors and chornic poor positioning.</p>
<p>The way to start working on it? Open the anterior hip. The first suggestion, as in the first question above, is to work the psoas with a lacrosse ball. Then use some positional stretching or joint approximation. The best mob for someone who is extremely tight is the first position of the couch stretch (<a href="http://youtu.be/SPpAECK8jFs?t=7m11s" target="_blank">queued up in this video</a>). My friend Luiz, who regularly walks in hyperlordosis, can barely post his foot up to get into this position. Note that we aren’t even attempting to post up with this type of person, just hanging out with both hands on the ground.</p>
<p>I’d also teach them what is “proper positioning” by helping them bring their pelvis underneath their torso (which contrasts how the pelvis usually is hinged out behind the torso). It usually involves turning the lower abs “on”. I read in a good communication book that every time you walk through a doorway, you want to orient your posture. There’s more to what the book said, but I’m using this technique for hyperlordosis abusers; every time they walk through a door they need to pull their hips back under them. Over several months they will get hundreds of repetitions of reorienting themselves, and I would have them mob their hip flexors AT LEAST twice a day until further notice. Their lifting style will probably need to be altered; this usually means they need to learn how to use a solid, straight trunk. I’ll leave this part of it for another time — you can’t save the world, and you can’t do it all at once.</p>

<p>Justin – any thoughts on conditioning for occassional, recreational backpacking? I don’t have time for regular rucking – would running/sprints/intervals have any carryover, despite being completely different time domains? I know CrossFit claims short intense workouts will address all endurance goals, but somehow that doesn’t sound right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear gumbo,</p>
<p>Maslow responded in kind and said:</p>
<p>@Gumbo I’m an avid backpacker/hunter and have never found that lifting complicates rather than interferes with my backpacking. I actually program in the backpacking days as rest days. For instance I’ll train after work on Friday night, wake up and do a longish (5-10 mile in the mountains) hike on Saturday, camp out, do the same hike back on Sunday, then train as usual on Monday without any trouble. I think strength training carries over directly to backpacking ability. The pack feels lighter, I can go longer without stopping, and it really helps that certain part of the male body.</p>
<p>I agree with him here. Typically in a backpacking, hiking, or camping scenario, you only carry what you need to carry. In a rucking scenario, you carry more than is necessary to adapt to it or because you have to. In the picture of the post, I have about 35 pounds of rocks in my pack (I was searching for them when I touched the cactus).</p>
<p>I think that hiking and backpacking is an incredibly fun and rewarding endeavor, something that people don’t do enough of. In the sense of having the capacity to do it, you’ll be fine (as Maslow says). If you were aiming to do it for performance, then you would do it different and adjust your programming to accommodate it. Doing interval work to prepare for backpacking/hiking isn’t really necessary, but it will improve your conditioning for those high elevation or high intensity moments.</p>
<p>During our walk, Chris had to stop a few times and catch his breath. We weren’t acclimated to the hot and incredibly dry environment (even at dusk). The elevation wasn’t really relevant (only 2,700 at the top, a gain of about 1,600ish), but Chris hasn’t been much conditioning other than pushing his truck. He certainly hasn’t been climbing any mountains or doing anything for an hour straight like we did. I talked to a girl on the plane who has hiked that mountain and she had to stop frequently; from the sound of it, Chris handled it better than her and he weighs nearly 300 pounds. His strength gave him the capacity, but his cardiovascular/respiratory adaptation was the limiting factor.</p>
<p>All that being said, doing intensity based conditioning will improve your backpacking, but you aren’t competing in it, so it isn’t really necessary. Just go do it. Besides, the best thing that helps improve hiking/backpacking/rucking is to do that thing.</p>

</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>In heavy weights (but doable) I slow down exactly where Chris does in the video with the 615. I pause but in the end I manage to complete the lift. Is this something common?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear dimitris,</p>
<p>I numbered your questions to make it easier.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>High intensity conditioning does include barbell complexes. It also includes CrossFitty met-cons, sprinting, or doing any activity with high intensity. You are correct in saying that hiking is “low intensity endurance training”. In the book we just call that “sustained effort”. Doing low intensity stuff will not be an efficient use of someone’s training time because a) it takes too much time, b) it’s adaptation isn’t as useful, and c) it would require too much recovery and therefore interfere with strength training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The three main categories of “high intensity endurance training” I labeled in <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">“FIT”</a></strong> are</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>– maximal</p>
<p>– interval</p>
<p>– sustained effort</p>
<p>There are sub-categories as well, and I provide a explain how stressful each one is and provide a very specific method to how you would schedule a given conditioning stress based on the lifting stress.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What you describe is common in people who push their butt back instead of up. If you watch carefully, this is what Chris does during the lift at 615. If the butt goes back, then the hamstrings lengthen and the knees extend slightly without actually applying force to the bar. Also, the back angle will lean over slightly — butt goes back, therefore chest goes forward. The result is a stall in the middle of the rep.</li>
</ol>
<p>I cued Chris to bounce it sharper, and then “drive like fuck” through that ROM. The cue was shortened to “bounce then DRIVE” when I was whispering violent things into his ear before he lifted it. In a novice, I would have said, “push the butt UP, not back” and eventually would shorten it to “push the butt”, and later “push”.</p>

  <p>There’s a dichotomy in how people are motivated. As a coach, it’s your duty to determine what this is and adapt to the needs of your trainee; you need to be the Batman they need, the one they deserve. It doesn’t mean you have to like it, because your primary goal should be to get the most out of that person.</p>
<p>Back in the day, advice from an old grandpa would be, “Quit crying. Get the shit done.” And it’s really a valid point of view. Other times it might be, “You suck. Get better.” Some people respond to this defiantly and strive to be better. The totalitarian coaching approach is documented in people like Bill Parcells and Bobby Knight; the players will almost rally against them in defiance to be successful.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people have feelings that need to be considered. God forbid you actually offend someone. Instead, things are focused on “You are wonderful. You can do this.” Instead of someone taking an objective look at themselves and realizing that they have work to do, society would like to convince them that they are perfect the way they are. Bullshit.</p>
<p>If we were perfect the way we are, then we wouldn’t have anything to strive to achieve. There wouldn’t be anything to do but wallow in our perfectness, and that’s exactly what these people tend to do. It’s the reason fat people think that not only do they NOT have to pay for two seats on an airline, but that the airline should accommodate THEM by changing their policy (and lose millions of dollars in the process). Yeah, they are so lazy that instead of changing themselves, they developed a narcissism so powerful that other people should sacrifice their resources to accommodate such laziness.</p>
<p>This, my friends, is what the FUCK we’re up against.</p>
<p>But don’t worry, you won’t ever be coaching or training any of these people because they will never make the decision to stop being what they are. As a senior in high school I had to write a satire that was in the vein of Jonathan Swift (who, by the way, had some of the biggest testicles in history). My “modest proposal” was to take all of the fat and lazy people and ship them directly into the sun. This was made more awkward when I saw my obese teacher’s face when she handed the paper back to me. I don’t know if I wrote it then, but the cost of a sun-shipment would be less than a) the cost of supporting them via healthcare and b) the irritation caused by having to hold their hand and trying to get them to change – especially when they are convinced they don’t have to. Who knows, maybe their lard could be used as fuel (just like on steamboats on the Mississippi River used to do).</p>

<p>Look, I’ve been the trainer in a local “Biggest Loser Challenge”; you can’t help someone who isn’t committed. The TV show has to offer a quarter million dollars to get them to do it! You can’t teach or transform someone who is not willing to do what it takes; it’s just so easy to quit. Arnold Schwarzenegger realized the same thing when he quit personal training because people didn’t care as much as he did. Then he went and made millions of dollars, badass movies, and was the first foreign-born governer since Irish-born John G. Downey in 1862. Why? Because he gave a shit. No big deal.</p>
<p>There will be those people who are “lost causes”, but there are many more on the bubble. It’s all about motivation. If someone is paying you money to coach them, you have a choice. Do you stubbornly stick to your principles and run trainees off who aren’t compatible with you? Or do you adapt your style to get the most out of your trainee and eventually teach them the way of the Force? The former doesn’t require any skill as a coach. The latter is how you can make a difference. Your pick, champ.</p>

<p><em>2nd Edit: When I wrote the edit above, I left the bold HTML tag open, hence the big, bad boldness. I’ll close this italics tag now.</em></p>
<p><a href="/blog/2012/02/optimal-sleep-positioning/" target="_blank">Earlier this year</a> I talked about how I observe levels of efficiency in everything; a “proficiency in efficiency”, if you will. I think about what order I should complete my daily tasks and how to best run errands when I leave home. I observe and analyze walking gait, posture, and running and lifting mechanics. I can see every mechanical problem in a person through observation. That left foot is rotated out when walking; I remember my first <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-awareness/" target="_blank">navicular drop</a>. That thoracic flexion, <a href="/blog/2011/09/internal-rotation/" target="_blank">internal shoulder rotation</a>, and cervical extension is gonna continue your downward spiral, champ. Oh, you’re chronically anteriorily rotated in your hip? Have fun with that hyperlordosis, chief.</p>
<p>It’s different than ascending from Plato’s cave. It’s more like seeing some 60 year old guy’s balls in the locker room; you can’t un-see it. But I do not long to be like all of you, those who are naive and ignorant of a wrinkly pair of grandpa testicles. No, I must teach you to abre los ojos and SEE! I must show you the way of the plums. I must teach you that which from of. It is my density.</p>
<p>If we’re going to spend five to twenty hours of our week training, then we damn well better be efficient in how we spend that time. That’s a large portion of our waking hours! There’s 168 hours in a week. 56 of those should be spent sleeping (8 hours/night). 40 of those are spent at school or work. That leaves us with 72 hours of waking hours. Depending on how much you train, eat, and spend doing recovery work, that could be 10 to 20 hours of activity; about 14 to 28% of your non-working hours respectively. That’s time that we could be spending with our family, making money, doing the horizontal rumba, or doing anything else that relaxes or makes us happy. It damn well better be efficient.</p>

<p>Take a step back from your programming template. Is it working towards your goal(s)? Do you even have a goal? Does the set/rep scheme fit that goal? Do the selected exercises meet that goal? Are you fluctuating training variables appropriately for your current state of adaptation? Does your template provide adequate recovery? Are you properly implementing sound diet and mobility habits? These are all things that will dictate the success of a program. If these things are not dialed in, then you won’t be making efficient progress. It means that your hard work in and out of the gym is resulting in less of a return on your time investment. That, my friends, is bullshit.</p>
<p>This website exists to help with that problem. New and old posts (use the search bar) aim to help improve your training from an acute and chronic perspective. I don’t like seeing guys drive their dick into the ground because of poor programming choices (last weekend in Arizona, the female equivalent of this term was affectionately coined “burning the labia off”). I give readers the chance to ask questions every week, and I write posts, articles, and books to help with common issues. If something is inefficient, you (the reader) have plenty of ways to find out why and how to correct it. I’ll back up everything I say with logic and physiology or I’ll find someone who is smarter than me to answer your question. All you have to do is ask, because I’d hate for your to have to lose your dugan in the garden of inefficiency.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’ve been on a hiatus from doing Programming Consultations. Those will start back up next week. They will consist of a one time consultation and programming template creation. We will also be starting to do “Weekly Programming” in which you have contact with the consultation team each week to have regular guidance. 70’s Big does not create cookie cutter templates and all programs are custom made for the individual. If you are interested, send an inquiry to <a href="mailto:70sBigConsult@gmail.com" target="_blank"><a href="mailto:70sBigConsultation@gmail.com">70sBigConsultation@gmail.com</a></a>. <a href="http://youtu.be/0s-vHiIpmdo" target="_blank">Here is a video</a> that briefly shows some of what is done for consultations.</p>
<p>I enjoy helping people make their training as efficient and productive as possible. I’ll continue doing my best to help (and entertain you) by writing for the website, conducting seminars, writing books (there are many en route), consulting, and, of course, answering your weekly questions on this website. Whether it’s through me or someone else, make sure your training is proficiently efficient. Take this opportunity to get it figured out ascend from the cave…and see an old man in budgie smugglers.</p>
