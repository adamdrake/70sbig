  <p>I realize some of you have an aversion to conditioning because of a disdain for CrossFit. Others consider conditioning a waste of time because they are primarily strength athletes — powerlifters, weightlifters, strongman competitors, or just someone who wants to be strong. Well, it’s time to stop being a baby and avoiding something that can help your strength training, your health, and your horizontal rumba.</p>
<p>“Conditioning” is a term that I use to represent “Endurance”. The latter is most often associated with long, slow distance (LSD) training, so I typically avoid using it. “Conditioning” technically also means “conditioning structures like muscles, tendons, bones, and ligaments to a stress”, so the term is actually too broad to use. Because of that, in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a></em> we used the phrase, “high intensity endurance training” to more properly define “high intensity conditioning”. High Intensity Endurance Training is what I’m referring to here when I say “conditioning”, and it can help a lifter.</p>
<p>At the very least, conditioning can help improve a lifter’s ability to recover in between sets. If a set of five is a strain on “conditioning capability”, then that’s problematic in a training program. Not only are the muscle fibers and motor neurons having to recover for the set, but the energy systems as well. If that same lifter had better conditioning capability, then the demand for the energy systems to recover would be removed, and they’d have quicker recovery between sets. That means they would be fresher to apply more force properly in the actual set, yet it would also help initiate overall recovery for the next workout because they are causing a lower overall stress.</p>

    Justin, Luiz, and Chris do some conditioning on Camel Back Mountain

</div>
<p>Conditioning is also something that regulates body fat. The “why” is because of how high intensity conditioning causes a deficit in substrates. The body adapts in a way that it can handle that deficit of substrates again in the future, and one of the adaptations is lowering body fat in the long term. A skeptic can just look at the waif-like, yet lean figures in the men’s CrossFit population (the part that doesn’t strength train). Obviously there are more variables that go into body composition, but conditioning is something that improves performance but <em>also</em> can lower body fat. Compare that to something like “fasted cardio”; it’s only performed to decrease body fat and actually has some negative side effects (e.g. being on your feet and walking for 5 to 8 hours a week).</p>
<p>The cardiovascular and respiratory adaptations to conditioning training will also help acute and long-term health. It helps improve recovery between sets. Being able to sustain higher rates of work or sustain a given rate of work for longer will only augment your horizontal ramba capability, though it won’t improve your skill. There are many benefits a strength athlete can gain from conditioning, but the fear is that it will hurt the strength training or overall strength.</p>
<p>Chris has had this fear for a while. We talked about including two days a week of conditioning after the Arnold, but it wasn’t really implemented. As we visited together, I emphasized that conditioning — especially when placed in a program properly — won’t be debilitating to heavy strength training. We proved that this past weekend in Arizona. Chris had numerous factors that were negatively effecting his training: sleeping on a couch for a week, not eating good quantities or qualities of food, travelling, and being in the sun a lot. Then on Friday night, we climbed Camel Back Mountain with our buddy Luiz. Chris hasn’t climbed a mountain in five years and doesn’t really do conditioning. There were times when he had to stop to catch his breath on the climb, not to mention the hundreds of “lunges” he did going up and all of the eccentric work on his knees on the way down. Nevertheless, he came into the gym the next day (after more travelling) to squat up to 615 and 620 (video below). If there was a set of circumstances that would result in ruining his strength or strength training, it would have been what he went through in the last week.</p>

<p>The point? When conditioning is properly programmed, it will augment your health and training. It won’t be debilitating to your heavy days. Conditioning is relative to what a person is adapted to, and in the future we’ll look at how to determine what to do and how to do it.</p>

  <p>Today is a travel day after a long, yet enjoyable weekend in Arizona. Chris and I stayed in both Phoenix and Tucson for the 70’s Big Seminar at Evolution Fitness. I’d like to thank Chris F. and Tyler for acting as lovable hosts throughout the weekend. I’d like to thank all of the attendees for being a good crowd, eager to learn, and for laughing at my jokes. It takes a lot of energy to be “on” for an entire weekend, but it’s always worth when it’s for top notch folks. I’d also like to thank my homies Chris and Luiz for having good shit, good shit.</p>
<p>Here’s a sweet video we made that will give you an idea of the time we had.</p>

  <h2 id="pr-friday">PR Friday</h2>
<p>As always, post your training PR’s and updates to the comments. Last week I set a goal for everyone: “meet your daily protein intake with primarily meat; only allow 25 to 50g of whey protein for your daily allotment.” Did any of you do it? It requires a bit more planning to eat mostly meat, but it’ll put better quality protein into your body instead of insulin-spiking whey. Something to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Next week’s goal: Aim to do heavy farmer’s walks at the end of at least two of your training sessions next week. Next Friday you’ll post your weight and estimated distance.</strong></p>

<p>Also, after reading what you said about the low bar grip causing elbow pain. Is that because your shoulders are in a similar position as if you were benching with the bar to your throat, and thus a really shitty position? I realize that it’s necessary to keep the bar tight on your back, but what constitutes a “good” and “bad” low bar grip (besides obviously the one that doesn’t hurt). Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear willey,</p>
<p>The reason why people often can’t get into a good low bar grip position is because it puts them in significant internal rotation. This would require the internal rotators to go through that ROM, but it would also be dependent on the external rotators stretching to that extent as well. It would also depend on other muscle groups like the rhomboids and middle traps, and could even affected by the serratus anterior and lat areas. In any case, shoulder mobility is necessary for a good low bar rack position — so much so that the low bar can often cause more problems than it is worth in some types of trainees.</p>
<p>The reason that the elbow receives stress is because the shoulders aren’t mobile enough to put the hands on top of the bar. Instead, the bar pushes down in the palm (usually with bent wrists), and the downward force pushes the entire arm down. It’s easy to see why the medial elbow would receive the brunt of that force since they are on the bottom of the elbow in that position. The result is pain in the medial elbow that will best be alleviated by stopping the thing that causes the stress; the low bar grip.</p>
<p>Whether or not the low bar is “superior” is dependent on the goals of the trainee. To summarize <a href="/blog/2012/01/low-bar-vs-high-bar-squatting/" target="_blank">this article</a>, if you’re powerlifting use the low bar; if you’re weightlifting, use the high bar. Otherwise it doesn’t really matter. If you’re weak in the posterior chain, the low bar will probably help a bit, but so will properly executed RDLs and good mornings. <strong>If you have chronic pain in the elbows or shoulders, you aren’t a pussy for changing your squat style in order to work on your mobility.</strong> That’d just be a smart decision. Why use a squat grip that is debilitating to other lifts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Justin, you’ve talked a lot about different kinds of equipment, be it mobility, lift enhancers, or standard gear lifters should have, all of which has been very helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kind of moving in the opposite direction however,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>what would you say would be the least equipment necessary for a novice lifter to run an effective program, and for how long would you expect that novice to be able to progress without additional investment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear ksik19,</p>
<p>I’d say that standard necessary gear are shoes, a good belt, 3 lacrosse balls, a green band, and a PVC pipe. The mobility stuff can be obtained for pretty cheap (aside from the band), and the shoes and belt will last a long time. Even lower quality shoes (like VS Athletics) will still last at LEAST 18 months (I’m on a second pair and they have lasted over 2 years, though I will be getting higher quality shoes soon). The belt will be kind of expensive, but it should last at least 5 years, and more like 10 years (just size it correctly).</p>
<p>You can view equipment <a href="/blog/2011/04/gear/" target="_blank">HERE</a> (page needs to be updated, but it’s mostly good).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just a quick question about tapering for competition. Two weeks Last Friday I hit a 162.5 kg squat for three. Due to shitty shift work,lack of sleep food etc I struggled with 160kg for 2 Friday just gone. My competition is one week on Wednesday, 6th June. I feel my confidence has been shattered. My goal was to have a kick ass squat of 400ib. Not sure what to do now as I’m 10 days out. Current body weight is 100kg. My other lifts pulled 210kg for a double. Benched 135 touch n go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Sam,</p>
<p>Take a deep breath. Relax. You didn’t get weaker in a week’s time, you were merely under-recovered given your work and sleep schedule. You already know this because you already told me that. So settle down.</p>
<p>As for your taper, I would have you do some moderate singles on the squat and bench today (Friday) but not deadlift. Pretend like you’re going up to your openers. On Monday you’ll do a very light workout of some triples or so on squat and bench; no more than 60%. Then compete on Wednesday with conservative openers and don’t make crazy jumps. In the mean time, eat and sleep very well and stay hydrated. Eat more meat than normal.</p>
<p>As for your openers, I’d probably have you open squat at 160 or 162.5. I don’t know your meet history so I’ll say don’t make more than 10k jumps. On bench you’ll probably want to open at 120 and make 5kg jumps to finish at 130 (you could aim to finish at 132.5 if you wanted, but I wouldn’t expect you to hit 135 paused if you only did it touch and go). Actually, if you have no experience pausing, then you probably should open even lower. Plan accordingly. Deadlift could go 180-200-220 if you wanted to take your last warm-up on the platform, an intermediary jump on the second attempt, and then the money shot on the third.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, is based on almost zero information. Factor in what you know, but don’t try and be a baller and make huge jumps. I’d rather you hit a third attempt and feel that you could have done more than miss it and feel like a shit head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nick asks,</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During the summer I like to run around a lot (his message says he plays random team sports 2-3x/week) and I am struggling to fit weightlifting in. My goal is to the extent possible, not lose muscle mass/swolertrophy. Will complexes twice a week help me accomplish that, and what other options do I have, if any?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Nick,</p>
<p>Yeah, you can really do anything you want. You can still get decent progress lifting twice a week. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p>Squat</p>
<p>Press</p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
<p>Bench</p>
<p>Deadlift or RDL</p>
<p>You could tack on pull-ups or a barbell complex on either or both days. You don’t have to lift in a way that is nut-busting. You don’t have to do a maximal 3×5. Most people lift the heaviest weight they can deadlift for 3 or 5 reps. This won’t work in most non-powerlifting programs, and it will just tire you out for your sport fun. There’s no reason these workouts should take more than 30 minutes (45 if you’re doing a complex too). They’ll help with body fat percentage given the hormonal effect from systemic training and it will maintain or improve your lean body mass.</p>
<p>The only thing in your way is your willingness to do it. You have a good set up that many people avoid because they feel it would hurt their lifting. You don’t have to act like them and avoid something; merely adjust your schedule to pull it off.</p>

  <p><a href="/blog/2012/05/mobility-the-stick/" target="_blank">Last week</a> we started talking generally about mobility and then focused on “The Stick” as a tool that can help with soft tissue work. To fully maximize the use out of The Stick, or any other tool used for soft tissue work, it helps to have an understanding of how and why they work.</p>
<p>First, you would need a decent understanding of <a href="/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/" target="_blank">musculoskeletal anatomy</a>. Knowing how and where muscles attach to bones and how they function in movement lays the foundation for what we work on. For example, knowing where muscles attach would help us figure out why a person has poor overhead position or why they have pain when racking a low bar squat.</p>
<p>Second, knowing the structure and positioning of muscle fibers would help us understand where and how to apply force on the tissues. In most cases the force will be applied along the muscle belly instead of across it, but there are some instances where the latter is used.</p>
<p>Third, given all of these specifics, we can look at the musculoskeletal system as a whole. If a muscle or a collection of muscles are tight, then they are shortened. If they are shortened, then there is more tension at their attachment sites. Attachment sites are almost always joints, and therefore joint pain is prevalent when muscle bellies are tight. Doing mobility exercises helps alleviate tension on these muscles to relieve the multi-angled tension at joints. This, in turn, will decrease pain at the joint or along a chain of attachments (e.g. relieving tension at the hip from all angles will decrease lower back and sacral pain).</p>
<p>This is why The Stick is an effective tool because it allows for a more pin pointed application of greater force. The following video is the second half of the video I made with Mike Hom in showing how The Stick can be used. We focus on serratus anterior, the posterior shoulder, calves/achilles, and hamstrings but allude to other ways The Stick can be used. Notice that the stick is used on segments to alleviate tension in the muscle to lessen tension at joints, as described above.</p>

  <p>Normally the female posts are on Monday, but yesterday was Memorial Day. I want to keep highlighting 70’s Big readers who compete every weekend because it’s always been my aim to urge readers to compete in <em>something</em>. Given that all of us enjoy lifting, it’s natural to try powerlifting, but other things like martial arts or recreational team sports are fair game. For some people, being able to participate in an active hobby like hiking is enough. I just want you to do <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>People get so much out of competing. They put themselves in an uncomfortable situation to perform as well as they can against others while being judged on how well they do it. There may be similar pressures in a work environment, but the biggest fear for physical competition is, “I’m not good enough.” That’s exactly why you should compete; because you aren’t. If you were good enough, you’d already have been at the world level. But it’s not about how you compare to others, it’s how you compare to yourself. Can you overcome the fear, submit the entry application, and show up to something you’re uncomfortable with? Can you properly conduct yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally in a competitive environment?</p>
<p>99% of the time, people have a great time and learn a lot about themselves. Most importantly, it funnels your training into a single event. It not only gives you something specific to train for, but it holds you accountable every day to prepare for that event. Squatting heavy means more when you know it’s part of the build up for a state powerlifting meet.</p>
<p>You probably competed as a child or as an adolescent and it helped define your character. If you haven’t competed in a while, then make it a point to get back on the platform, the field, or the court. It’ll keep you keen and sharp.</p>
<p>This past weekend, a long-time 70’s Big reader, Kari (she posts as Karibot) competed in a push-pull meet. She benched 67.5kg (a PR and state record) and deadlifted 110 and 115kg. The 115kg was a PR, but “(she) stood up with it, locked it out easily, and was red lighted because (she) “apparently” put it down before the command. (She) will never let that happen again”. And she was complimented on wearing a 70’s Big shirt. Congrats, Kari — proud of ya.</p>

<p>Hi Justin —</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Competed in my first meet today. Results are in the comments from Friday’s post, but I thought I’d send in a picture repping 70s Big.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>And many thanks for urging all of us to get serious and compete. I never would have done this without the 70s Big support!</p>

  <p>Take a deep, luxurious breath. How does it feel? Normal? It should feel both normal and abnormal.</p>
<p>It’s normal because it’s the same as the million of breaths that have come before it. You’re an American breathing freely whilst pursuing your life’s happiness. Yet it’s abnormal and weird because the only reason you’re content taking that breath is because there is man or woman who has earned it for you.</p>
<p>An American soldier has pulled on his boots, shouldered his pack, and squeezed the stock of his rifle, sweating. This man forfeited his freedoms, left his family, and sacrificed his youth. This man did all of this, yet isn’t compensated for his sacrifices. In fact, he is often shunned for going out of his way to choose this fate.</p>
<p>Yet, this man is the reason you are able to take your next breath, the reason you can wake up in the morning and do whatever you damn well please. This man protects the richest of the rich, yet also enables the dredge of society to suck the teat and be rewarded for sloth. He’s the reason that a bar fight, this website, or a children’s spelling bee can exist. His sacrifice is blind to the recipients’ outcome, yet it is all encompassing nonetheless.</p>
<p>You may have known the man with the rifle, yet he has existed for more than 200 years and he gives you this next breath freely. You are free to do whatever you want with that breath, but it’d be a disgrace if it wasn’t spent doing everything you can to be the best person, father, brother, friend, son, worker, or stranger that you can. Your last breath was a freebie; now earn your next in honor of those riflemen who make breathing possible.</p>
<p>Lest we forget our fallen…</p>

  <h2 id="pr-friday">PR Friday</h2>
<p>Post your training updates and PR’s to the comments. <a href="/blog/2012/05/recap-prfriday/" target="_blank">Last week</a> I put a challenge to 70’s Big readers to do mobility work every day. Did anyone do it? <strong>Next week’s goal: meet your daily protein intake with primarily meat; only allow 25 to 50g of whey protein for your daily allotment.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t have any awesome stories like last week; I’ve mostly been inside writing (will announce some new things soon). Chris will be visiting me in Florida and we’ll do a Q&amp;A video with him. Post your questions to the comments as well.</p>
<p>I was kind of irritated on Wednesday (<a href="https://twitter.com/70sBig/status/204748545302085634" target="_blank">this may have something to do with it</a>) and decided to squat 405 for as many reps as I can after snatching up to 120kg. I was going for 12, but got confused when I was dying. Squatting strength is not a priority in my lifting, but I was still disappointed in this.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear Kyp,</p>
<p>Since you’re into weightlifting, I’ll assume you’re doing the lifts to some extent in your new 3x/week template. My suggestion would be using a Medium-Light-Heavy template with the lifts since that would coincide with using a TM approach to your squats. You could throw in push-presses on the Medium or Heavy days too.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Given that your program most likely involves the snatch and CJ on a daily basis, it might apply too much weekly work to use sets of five on the front squat. By using three triples (3×3), you can reduce the volume a bit. The lesser time under tension per set may help you recover a bit better so that you can go in on the Heavy day and lift well. On the other hand, doing triples would allow you to use heavier weight, so you still may be hampered. I used three ascending triples on a TM a few years ago (I low barred on the volume/intensity days), and it initially caused some fatigue, but wasn’t as bad when I adapted to it. You could use ascending triples to lower the overall intensity hit on the front squat day, yet still be able to hit a top set to help push your front squat and clean recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the discussion directly above, we could modify what you propose for your TM template. By the way, it’s not bad. I’d first point out that you would NOT want to increase Day 1’s load every week. It’s good that you aren’t using a 5×5, but if the 3×5 continuously increases, then your actual heavy set on Day 3 will be hampered because of a growing recovery deficit every week. The Texas Method E-book Part 1 states that we’d want to increase the heavy day (your “Day 3”) for three weeks before increasing the volume work (your “Day 1”). I’d emulate that in your program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can switch the front squats to ascending sets to ensure you’re still operational for Day 3. Furthermore, you could switch Day 3 to three ascending doubles to handle even greater amounts of weight. Doing a 5RM is fine in the early stages of a TM (first few months), but it’s time under tension is much higher than doing doubles or triples. And obviously you can handle more weight with fewer reps than a 5RM, and handling more weight for few reps is what Olympic weightlifting is all about. You could progress the 5RM weekly until it slows; while you do that, keep your Day 1 work load under control. Then switch to two triples or three doubles on Day 3 and progress that. There are plenty of options, but the optimal method usually revolves around not doing too much volume. Unless you’re on drugs.</p>

<p>When taking a 1-2 month hiatus, how should a lifter eat? I don’t want to start over from square one when I go back, but obviously if I still eat like I’m training, it’ll just get packed away as fat. Should I just try to eat clean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear juco,</p>
<p>Congrats on your procreation PR. This leaves the scope of this answer, but you can still get some decent training in at home without gym equipment. They could be short, 15 minute sessions at home that focus on plyos and power.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you follow the site you already know that I’m an advocate of lifters eating pretty clean regularly. That means a LOT of meat, potatoes, fats, and veggies. Realistically, if you drop the training out, then the only thing that would need to change is a reduction in dense carbohydrates and maybe the overall fat content. Judging by your question, I assume you do not eat like this when training, so the answer would be to use this opportunity to clean up your diet.</p>
<p><strong>Remember: fat does not apply force to move weight</strong>. Everyone here should aim to be big, strong, powerful, and athletic. John Welbourn did a really good <a href="http://talktomejohnnie.com/diet/what-should-i-eat" target="_blank">diet summary post for the power athletes</a>. I stress this type of diet because you’ll have better performance when you are actually training, but you’ll also set yourself with very good habits for old age and longevity. I think it’d be really awesome if 70’s Big existed for the next 50 years and we all grew old and hated each other, but we were still lifting weights, running around, and having sex with our wives (husbands?). I’d rather not hear about a bunch of readers dying. “Oh, you remember CriedTheFox? He fucking died while driving his boat on the lake. They said he had a cupcake in his hand…”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I’m misunderstanding part of this. So I get that it helps keep you in external rotation, which will help you bench better without it, much like how a belt strengthens your trunk. But those sets you did, are those then easier (like when wearing a belt) or harder (like using bands on the bar)? I feel like your explanation and mark’s say are said in ways that sound confusing/contradictory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear willey,</p>
<p>The Slingshot assists the bench movement by supporting the action of joints. A belt supports the trunk, a segment, by improving pressure. This is why a Slingshot would not be considered “raw”. I did sets of 185 and 275 in that video; they were easier because of the assistance The Slingshot provides. Normally I would need a lot more warm-up to get to that weight. Mark and I are saying the same thing, just in different ways.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been having some elbow problems (probably medial epicondylitis). I thought this was from dropping my elbows when coming out of the bottom of a low bar squat, and thus putting a lot of compression on that joint. However, after paying attention to it for a few workouts, I’m still having some residual pain that seems exacerbated by benching and pressing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think the slingshot will help alleviate some of this pain? In your experience, does elbow pain result from incorrect benching mechanics (maybe incorrect wrist or forearm positioning creating a shitty moment arm?)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear ksik10,</p>
<p><strong>Pain in the medial elbow is almost always caused by poor low bar squat grip placement</strong>. Sometimes I’d almost prefer everyone to high bar, because this such a common issue. You will feel the pain in your elbow when pressing or benching because it’s stressed from shitty positioning when squatting. You won’t feel the pain during the set because it’s subtle, but the compounding stress will leave it sore.</p>
<p>Since I’m almost convinced it’s caused by the squat grip, the Slingshot will not alleviate your pain. If you are internally rotating while benching, then The Slingshot may help reduce that pain by improving your mechanics, but it still ignores the cause of the problem. Start mobbing your shoulders yesterday; just search “shoulder” and do two videos a day. Internal rotators, external rotators, anterior shoulder girdle, thoracic spine, and lats. Go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can see how it (The Slingshot) helps with lift mechanics, but I’m confused about the benefits of it as far as “compressive overload” (I think that’s what I heard you call it in the video). Doesn’t the slingshot act similar to doing pullups with a stretch band? Even though more weight can be loaded on the bar, aren’t you effectively reducing the load when the slingshot is stretched at the bottom of the bench? Maybe I’m just not understanding it correctly…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>I said “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload" target="_blank">progressive overload</a>“. There is some marginal or arbitrary amount of load that is removed from the acting muscles as a result of the assistance The Slingshot provides. However, the structures still support the load (and therefore adapt to the greater load), and the lockout is still 100% unassisted. Despite there being a little bit of “help” out of the very bottom, the rest of the “ease” is due to the improved mechanics. The shoulders are in external rotation which allows the elbows to be “under the wrist”, a position that I coach. This ensures the triceps are fully involved.</p>
<p>It’s not at all comparable to doing pull-ups with a band because that merely has an effect on the overall load. The Slingshot has an effect on the mechanics which in turn has an effect on the load. That’s an important distinction, and the very reason that The Slingshot is not a piece of shit.</p>

Is there any structural and/or CNS benefit to doing huge overloads?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Paul,</p>
<p>Do you comb or brush your beard? Do you Stroup? Cloud? I let my facial hair get pretty long, longer than I think it was in the winter. Then I realized it wasn’t a good idea in 90+ degree heat and humidity.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It depends. Is your bench form solid? Or do you have issues with proper external rotation? It could be that your mechanics are limiting your muscular development and inhibiting your climb to 315. If you aren’t in a good, externally rotated position during your bench, your triceps will not apply force and develop as well. This would have an effect on your press or overhead movements (Paul has done strongman in the past).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, <a href="/blog/2012/01/qa-16/" target="_blank">I don’t like the phrase “CNS Fatigue”</a> (ctrl+f “CNS” to find relevant portion). There is some utility in undergoing those types of stresses, yet the adaptation would probably be most relevant to strongman. Yoke walks, fahmahs, Conan’s wheels are all badass, but we would need to keep the goals of the program intact. Is the goal to prepare for strongman? They need to be done. Is the goal to get stronger in the squat? Then squat. Heavy walk outs may help a guy think the weight is light, but it might be occurring at the expense of fatiguing him. Instead, if he had more recover prior to his next heavy session, then the weight might feel lighter. In other words, the heavy walk outs might be something that compounds stress, puts him in a recovery deficit, and doesn’t make his next heavy session feel lighter. But that would depend on the program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A general strength trainee can get benefit out of these “overloaded total body stresses”, but he will need to program accordingly. Especially when he’s not adapted to them. Sure, it’s cool to be a tough guy and endure an ass kicking yoke walk randomly, but it’s only detrimental if it inhibits the next squatting workout. Put it in context of the program and goals. The lifts/activities can definitely act as strength training, but they would require a proper progression into them (at least for the sake of joints, even in “fit” lifters).</p>

  Fitness fan found dead under crushing bench press weights
</h2>
<p>
  </a><br /> I&#8217;m not sure how a person can be a &#8220;fan&#8221; of fitness (who is on the team? who do they play against?), but this guy is dead from bench pressing. You may remember that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4512778" target="_blank">USC Trojan running back Stafon Johnson had a bar fall on his throat</a> while benching; he required surgery to repair the crushing damage on his throat and larynx.<br /> <br /> <strong>The bench press is the most dangerous lift you can perform</strong>. The bar is moving over the sensitive throat and face area, and, as you can see in the article above, people die from doing it. Here are things to keep in mind when doing it:<br /> <br /> 1. <strong>Never use a false grip</strong><br /> A false grip is one in which the thumbs are not wrapped around the bar; Stafon Johnson undoubtedly was using a false grip. . It&#8217;s easy for the bar to slip over the edge of the heel of the palm when the thumb isn&#8217;t wrapped. Always wrap your thumb around the bar for every pressing movement.

<pre><code>&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-6858&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
  This is the false grip. It is stupid as hell unless you have safety guards on your bench stand.
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
  </div>
<p><br /> People use the false grip because it puts their wrist in a close-compacted position and feels better, but they do so because they don’t know how to do it right with their thumb wrapped. I’ll do a post on this in the near future. If you’re using a correct grip and there are other people available…<br /></p>
</p>
<p>
  2. <strong>Have a good spotter</strong><br /> A spotter is there to prevent the bar from falling on your face and throat. Note that if a false grip is used, and the bar actually drops on you (as it did Stafon), there is nothing that a spotter can do. What they <em>can</em> do is prevent damage on the sternum or abdominal organs if the bar is pinned on the lifter (or obviously prevent the lifter from getting pinned in the first place). If you don&#8217;t trust your spotter, then get several to stand on each end of the bar. If you don&#8217;t have spotters, then&#8230;<br /> <br /> 3. <strong>When lifting alone, never use collars</strong><br /> The idiotic globo gyms don&#8217;t understand that if you&#8217;re benching alone, and the bar is pinned on you, it&#8217;s not easy to get it off. This is where internal organ injuries occur (there have been cases of people not knowing they injured something until the middle of the night when their internal bleeding became problematic). If the plates are un-collared, then it&#8217;s easy to slide the weight off of one side and then the other to get un-pinned from the bar. The guy in the article above probably was pinned under the weight with collars on.<br /> <br /> But he was also drunk, so it&#8217;s probably not a good idea to train or lift when you&#8217;ve been drinking. Unless you&#8217;re Chris Riley, who at one point drank a six pack and then PR&#8217;d on snatch. That is neither here nor there.<br />

</h2>
<p>
  Graham Harrell is the backup quarterback for the Green Bay Packers. This off-season he trained at Accelerate Performance Enhancement Center (APEC) to put on 14 pounds of muscle in 18 weeks. The training mostly consisted of active mobility work, rotational power, and strengthening the shoulder girdle.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;The first thing we did was try to break those (mobility) barriers,&#8221; Stroupe said. &#8220;And then we tried to strengthen his body through rotation. We strengthened the rotator cuff and scapula region. A lot of the same things you&#8217;d do with a pitcher, but we did a lot of it in motion because he&#8217;s always moving when he&#8217;s throwing as opposed to a pitcher.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  He did weight training three times a week and speed training twice a week. Each session started with about 45 minutes of &#8220;lunging, stretching, and functional movement&#8221;. This is what I&#8217;m summing up as &#8220;active mobility&#8221; work. His weight training had a shoulder emphasis, and it included him using rowing machines and high pulls &#8212; even rowing &#8220;six plates&#8221;.<br /> <br /> <a href="/2012/05/graham52212.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6862" data-permalink="/blog/2012/05/news-6/mjs-packers23-39-of-hoffman-jpg-packers23/" data-orig-file="/2012/05/graham52212.jpg" data-orig-size="300,207" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Mark Hoffman&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D Mark IV&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Quarterback Graham Harrell throws a pass during the Green Bay Packers organized team activities Tuesday, May 22, 2012 on Ray Nitschke Field in Green Bay, Wis.

This is important for a professional athlete, especially a quarterback. It&#8217;s easy for us as lifters to look at a program and pick it apart because it doesn&#8217;t have squats, presses, or power cleans. But high level performers need to be specifically trained to improve their ability at performing at a high level. Furthermore, various sport positions need to be trained differently than other positions. We don&#8217;t have Harrell&#8217;s program sitting in front of us, but we already know it worked.<br /> <br /> There&#8217;s a lot of stupid shit out there, and there might even be parts of various programs that we think could be different or better, but let&#8217;s not ignore when something has a lot of success. I admire Harrell&#8217;s work ethic because some NFL players won&#8217;t significantly improve their physical capability year-to-year. When a quarterback is labeled as having a weak arm, the media acts like it&#8217;s something he can&#8217;t ever improve. I hope Harrell proves them wrong this year.<br />

  <p>In my seminars I teach principles of mobility to help keep lifters/trainees/athletes healthy and soldiers operational. What we call “mobility” is just a general term to mean “maintaining or improving mobility to achieve proper positioning to perform well and prevent injury”. Overall, it’s a means to an end of not eradicate static and dynamic positional inhibition. Mobility is necessary for efficient and productive lifting. Mobility has several areas of emphasis:</p>
<p>– Soft tissue work</p>
<p>– Positional stretching</p>
<p>– Joint approximation</p>
<p>These areas can be effective by themselves, yet are best used to augment one another. One way to think of the results of mobility training is that it reduces tension on muscle systems. For example, a trainee’s neck hurts from a car wreck. They like to compete in Olympic weightlifting, yet when the volume of their lifting goes up, their neck hurts more. Without soft tissue work, they feel helpless and hopeless about their condition. This is a real world example because it happened to me (minus the hopeless/helpless part). Mobility training reduces that tension to alleviate pain at the neck, and could even improve existing anatomical assymetry (in this case, a temporarily rotated cervical vertebrae).</p>
<p>“The Stick” is a useful tool to work on soft tissue: muscle bellies, tendons, and fascia. When soft tissue is tight, it can cause dysfunction in the muscle or apply tension and subsequently pain at a joint (like the knee, hip, or shoulder). The stick is most effective when a friend uses it on you because they can reach areas you cannot and apply more force than you can solo. Be sure to purchase the “stiff” version of the stick, and not just for the laughs; I’ve put my whole body weight on it and it didn’t deform or break. The following video shows some general tips on using the stick as well as one specific example of how to use it on the upper shoulder and neck area. This would be excellent for Olympic lifters, anyone doing any overhead lifting, soldiers or back packers who carry a heavy pack/ruck, and anyone with a tight or painful neck.</p>

<p>“The Stick” can be found on Amazon or at Rogue Fitness. A future video will include calf, hamstring, lat/teres major, serratus anterior, triceps, and forearm work. The Stick is best used on any segment and has a much different (i.e. better) effect than just using a lacrosse ball, PVC pipe, or rumble roller. I highly recommend it.</p>
