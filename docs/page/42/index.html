  <p>A few months ago Matt Wichlinski wrote an article (“<a href="http://www.tssathletics.com/1/post/2012/03/slaying-the-dragon.html" target="_blank">Slaying The Dragon</a>“) that criticized how CrossFit coaches allow bad technique in the pursuit of a faster time. Often when someone makes this argument, they are on the outside of CF and looking in. Matt, like me, has the CrossFit Level II certification. It’s earned through a quasi-difficult testing process where the candidates lead a group of trainees through the CF teaching progressions. It’s the only identifier in the CrossFit world that a coach can adequately see movement problems, have enough personality to lead a group, and communicate decently. I assume Matt and I are similar in that we don’t rely solely on CF for training methodology, but we know enough about it to give fair, objective critiques. Matt’s revolves around the following idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone has the right to train and compete in any fashion that they want. But as a coach, I hate to see other coaches doing things that might harm the athletes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree. Poor, inefficient mechanics is something that bothers me. In the short-term, it’s something that reduces the effectiveness of the exercise and opens the trainee up to potential injury. In the long-term, crappy mechanics always results in some sort of mobility limitation or injury. If a trainee’s knees chronically jut forward at the bottom of their squat, the proximal (upper) rectus femoris (a hip flexor) tendon will become irritated and inflamed. If their knees crank in at the bottom, the glute medius and TFL become irritated. A collapsed thoracic spine on thrusters, squats of any kind, or overhead movements will jack up the proximal biceps, the external rotators, rhomboid and middle trap area, and can create a chain of tension that puts strain on the spinal erectors that can increase pain the lower back and hips. We’re not even getting into the ballistic movements on untrained achilles tendons or the severely internally rotated shoulders in overhead work.</p>
<p>However, I have a problem with how Matt is wording this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to be good at what you do, you have to understand what you are doing, why you are doing it, and how to do it safely and effectively. The first rule of training is “Do no harm.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I get what Matt is trying to say here. He’s saying, “As a coach/trainer, you shouldn’t be hurting your trainees. That’s the friggin’ opposite of what you’re supposed to do, so don’t set them up for failure with incompetence or ignorance.” Matt made a video that makes fun of some guys doing some really shitty power snatch reps in one of the open “WODs” that leads into Regionals competitive events. His emphasis of not doing harm is in response to routinely seeing harmful movement patterns and sloppy technique; I get it.</p>
<p>Yet, preaching the idea of “do no harm” is misleading. An adaptive stress, by definition, is something that does harm. If you apply three sets of five of work with the squat on someone with appropriate weight, that’s something their system and structures aren’t adapted to; they literally get damaged. Muscles are primarily receiving the brunt of the stress, yet ligaments, bones, and tendons do as well. The application of force disrupts homeostasis and forces the body to begin recovery processes in order to not only heal, but to adapt so it can handle that same stress easier or more of it in the future. This is Hans Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome. Said in another way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seyle proposed that all organisms mount an acute response, then a chronic adaptation after</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>surviving exposure to stress. The final adaptation enables the organism to tolerate a subsequent</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and more intensely stressful exposure to the same type of stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a>, by Kilgore, Lascek, and Hartman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know Matt knows this, or at least understands the underlying principle, yet I don’t think it’s a good mantra for other lesser coaches. In my seminars, Selye’s theory is the foundation for programming and I derive everything from it. The body will try to adapt to any sub-lethal stress, but that doesn’t mean we should apply a stress that is directly under the “lethality level”. There is a correct dose of stress that will garner desired results, and the job of the coach/programmer is to know this. The “Dose/Response Relationship” can be described mathematically. If there is a hypothetical level of stress, x, that will make the trainee stronger or fitter, then why apply x+5, 2x, or x^2? Progressive overload in stress application is paramount in programming, and it’s something that CrossFit often abandons.</p>
<p>On one hand, I may just be arguing semantics with something Matt wrote, but on the other hand it can effect how thousands of trainees or coaches go about their training (especially given that his article has been circulated well). Long-time followers of CrossFit will remember Greg Glassman saying that an effective training program will have some percentage of injuries. That percentage may be low, but is acceptable in a program that generates productive results. This concept may be true, depending on what percentage we’re talking about, but an injury in a training program is an indication of a problem.</p>

<p>In CrossFit we see plenty of shoulder issues that are no doubt related to kipping pull-ups. We see tons of calcaneal (achilles) tendon tears and ruptures as a result of superfluous box jumps and other jumping activity. We see lumbar and sacral dysfunction.. These are indications of deficient movement and movement capabilities in the trainees. No, a coach or program should not hurt his trainees. Yes, it sometimes happens in even good programs with good coaches. Matt observes that this is common in CrossFit, and it is. Here, harm means injury.</p>
<p>Yet harm to an organism and their structures is the basis by which that organism adapts. We place organized, purposeful stress on a trainee and their structures. It causes harm, and that harm is the stress that makes them adapt to be stronger and fitter. Let’s not confuse the distinction, but let’s use this opportunity to teach trainees and coaches about proper progression and development — vital aspects in a good program.</p>
<p>In the “Mixed Elemental Fitness” chapter I wrote in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a>, I go in detail about how to progress each component of fitness — strength, endurance, and mobility. It’s based on the foundation of understanding the stress/adaptation process as well as the preceding chapters in the book that focus on physiology and strength and endurance training. A CrossFitter could benefit because it shows how to structure the varying levels of high intensity conditioning throughout the week, and how to do so with respect to strength training. This often results in the mantra of, “Stop doing so much shit and focus your goals.”</p>
<p>Overall, Matt and I have the same sentiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re an athlete, please don’t hurt yourself in the name of elite fitness, focus on getting stronger and doing things better. Paying someone money to have them kick you in the dick never made much sense to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of your training method, ensure that you are moving efficiently, training productively, and not doing harm…in the injury sense.</p>

  <p>This last weekend various female 70’s Big readers performed well in raw powerlifting meets (and one long-time male reader, Yosh). I just wanted to give them some public congratulations. From now on, if you compete in a meet (or any other competition), send in your results to the <a href="www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a> and we’ll honor you on Monday’s post.</p>
<h2 id="708217s-big-chicago-lifting-group">70’s Big Chicago Lifting Group</h2>
<p>Ellee started a lifting group that regularly meets to train together, but they also are starting to go and compete together. Three women and one fella competed in a USAPL meet this past weekend and did really well.</p>

<p>Harj and Robin competed in an AAU powerlifting meet and one the top two “best female lifter” spots (Harj edged out Robin). Both of them have a background in CrossFit and they attended my 70’s Big Workshop, so I’ve been fortunate enough to coach them. I’m proud of both of them.</p>
<p>Harj squatted 176, benched 99.2, and deadlifted 220.5 (all in pounds) in the 114 lbs weight class. Robin squatted 195, benched 120, and deadlifted 285.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-recap">Weekly Recap</h2>
<p>Monday <a href="/blog/2012/05/spicy-bourbon-pork-recipe/" target="_blank">I gave you a tasty recipe</a>, and readers dropped some of their favorite slow cooker recipes in the comments. Tuesday discussed how <a href="/blog/2012/05/the-crossfit-quads/" target="_blank">CrossFit favors the anterior chain</a> and it’d behoove a CFer to do some extra posterior chain work. Wednesday we talked about the <a href="/blog/2012/05/the-slingshot-2/" target="_blank">Slingshot</a> again; I think it can be a nice tool even for a raw lifter. Thursday was a post on the possible short film “<a href="/blog/2012/05/the-artist-the-olympian/" target="_blank">The Artist &amp; The Olympian</a>“.</p>
<p>Here are two stories that <em>actually</em> recap the week. Wednesday night I was training with my friend Mike (not big AF Mike, Asian Mike). He ended up leaving the gym around 8:00 PM, so I was hitting some dumbbell hammer curls by myself. There was no one else in the free weight section, yet there were some girls using a Roman chair about 30 feet away. I was doing the last set, really cranking them out, when I suddenly and audibly farted. When I was younger, I might have been more concerned. In fact, I remember accidentally letting out farts in class and being absolutely horrified. It was an immediate shot of adrenaline; all my senses would sharpen and I’d just wait for someone (i.e. girls) to acknowledge it. THEY NEVER DID. I’d play it cool. Hey, it wasn’t me that farted, must have been that skinny kid with the lisp. I had a reputation to maintain. The kind that don’t fart in class, son.</p>
<p>Anyway, I look up to see if anyone heard me fart. Either they didn’t, or they did and pretended not to hear. So I continue hammer curling the 50s. Then ANOTHER fart escapes, yet this one was louder. I only have a few more reps, so I try to continue, but I can’t because I’m LAUGHING TOO HARD. I’m by myself laughing at my own farts, and I couldn’t finish the set. I racked the dumbbells, called it a night.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Thursday evening. I’m walking out of a shopping center where I got my hair cut. I’m wearing gym shorts, a tight T, and flip flops. I’m walking by two black ladies in the middle of the street. One of them is around 40. She stops in the middle of the road with her hands on her hips, looks me up and down.</p>
<p>“DAMN. You is SO sex-AY!”</p>
<p>After thanking her and laughing, I realized that some guys might think that this encounter was a result of the hammer curls they did the night before. NOT SO FAST, MY FRIEND. It’s because I’ve squatted twice a week for as long as I can remember. It’s the pressing, the cleans, the snatches; the lifting. It’s also the mobility work, the attention to nutrition, the sleeping, and the hydration. It’s the icing and rest days. It’s everything.</p>
<p>Moral of the story? Black women know what’s up. Or maybe this is the pinnacle of all of the work I’ve put into training. Regardless, if you want to be approached on the street, then get your shit together. It’ll help if you move to the south. And a low income town.</p>
<p>What else do you guys wanna talk about?</p>

  <p>[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/135145137/the-artist-and-the-olympian/widget/video.html]</p>
<p>Adam Scheiner has a vision that will portray art in its most natural form. “The Artist &amp; The Olympian” is a preliminary short for a full feature script. It will show the emotional and artistic connection between a painter and a weightlifter as they try and achieve the pinnacle of their potential. Weightlifting itself may seem bland to the untrained eye, but a weightlifter is always on the quest to the perfect form, the perfect lift. A weightlifter aims to brush off their blemishes, their failures in the pursuit of the perfect lift, that one moment in time that will represent their years of bleeding ache.</p>
<p>A painter’s life is spent releasing their emotions onto canvas. They only hope that the viewer can understand the image that resulted from opening their soul. This artist has a feeling in mind, a concept that they are struggling to emit into the visual realm. The artist paints and strokes. The lifter strains and toils. They are one in unison; they search for the truest form of art, one that brings peace to their heart.</p>
<p>This is the story that Adam wants to tell. And did I mention that <a href="http://donnyshankle.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/never-let-go" target="_blank">Donny Shankle</a> will be the weightlifter? Yeah…</p>
<p>However, a well done short film is not easy, and it isn’t cheap. In order for this project to be possible, his production team <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/135145137/the-artist-and-the-olympian" target="_blank">needs to raise $15,000 dollars</a> (at this time, they have raised $2,210). The full line by line cost of the project is included on that information and donation page. I encourage anyone who is interested to donate a small amount to this fund. If 25% of 70’s Big readership donates $1 — a single doll hair — then Adam’s team will have more than enough to make the project a reality.</p>
<p>On a similar note, if you’ve ever heard anyone bitch about how nobody does anything to improve weightlifting in the U.S., then show them <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/135145137/the-artist-and-the-olympian" target="_blank">this page</a>. This video can open the door to a full feature film that shows the purity in weightlifting — one that will resonate and garner the interest of non-weightlifters. Forward this link to all the USAW haters, all the people who think American weightlifting is failing, because donating to this video actually accomplishes something instead of just bitching on the internet. Remember, every doll hair counts, so don’t feel pressured to drop more than one.</p>

  <p>There are only a few products that I wholeheartedly endorse, and <a href="http://www.howmuchyabench.net/" target="_blank">Mark Bell’s Slingshot</a> is definitely one of them. <a href="/blog/2011/11/the-slingshot/" target="_blank">I’ve written about it before</a>, but it was before I met Mark Bell and Jesse Burdick at the 2012 Arnold Sport Festival. Mark and Jesse were both really nice guys and they took the time to let me demo the Slingshot as well as chat about it afterwards. Observe the demo:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwIY7QmUd9s" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The weight on the first set was 185 while the second set was <strong>275</strong>. Note that they told me it was 225 on the bar for the second set, so I felt like a fucking loser when it felt hard (your demo secret is out, Mark, you bastard). I’m not an exceptionally strong bencher (I’ve done 350), yet I usually do sets of 135, 185, 225, and 255 before I move to 275 for my final warm-up on bench (I found that more sets on pressing movements helps warm me up better). As you can see, I do 185×10 and then 275×9 with about 20 seconds of rest in between. As you can see, the slingshot allows the lifter to impart an exceptional work load on their benching musculature.</p>
<p>With a Slingshot you can either perform more reps at a given weight, more weight in a give set/rep scheme, more total sets, improve your mechanics, or improve your raw bench lockout. That’s some impressive utility, and that’s just for a raw powerlifter. Learn more in the following video:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0rgSyZ56MQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The mechanics are improved because the Slingshot helps keep the elbows in a good position that results in an externally rotated shoulder. If you’ve <a href="/blog/2011/10/lats-while-benching/" target="_blank">read this post</a>, then you understand that the lats are stretched and isometrically acting during a bench press (they are internal rotators, so when the shoulder is in external rotation, they are stretched). This provides greater shoulder stability in the bench and is necessary for a strong bench. The Slingshot can reinforce shoulder external rotation, especially in lifters (male or female) who have issues with habitual internal rotation. Chronically stroking the bench with good mechanics via a Slingshot will develop the musculature to do it raw.</p>
<p>Since the Slingshot provides the most assistance out of the bottom and maintains good mechanics, the triceps are properly recruited to do their job in locking out the bench. This is amplified when the lifter is using greater loads or volume with the Slingshot.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it’s a great tool. Pick one up if you’ve run into shoulder or elbow problems when you bench. It’s not a substitute fix-all for shoulder health (e.g. you still need to do the overhead press properly), but it can allow quality bench training despite the normal bench-related injuries.</p>

  <p>It’s funny how CrossFit has such a staunch anti-bodybuilding sentiment, yet it’s participants clearly share a narcissistic vibe. Early on the workouts were short, intense, and effective and the high enthusiasm laid the foundation for how well CF has expanded. True athletes like my friend Eva Twardokens and Greg Amundson excelled and were highlighted, and everyone wanted to be like them. There was that element of “showing some skin”, but an argument could be made that it was for the sake of utility. For example, <a href="http://youtu.be/U3x7vb0CffI" target="_blank">in this video</a>, Amundson starts fully clothed and sheds the shirt mid-workout.</p>
<p>I’ve done a lot of CrossFit and high intensity training in climates that are much harsher than California, and I can assure you that life is easier without a shirt on. But nowadays, fashion — whether it concerns the clothing or the body — is the norm in CrossFit.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: <strong>there’s nothing wrong with this</strong>.</p>
<p>I’d rather it be that way. Let’s be honest, we like seeing attractive people. Lots of people also like clothing fashion as it relates to CF. I know nothing of fashion, but I know this because I see, “Can’t wait to see what everyone is wearing in the CF Regionals comp this weekend!” on Facebook.</p>
<p>I, of course, have a bias in that I appreciate well built folk who are exceptionally strong, powerful, and athletic. It’s why this website exists. So when I see people fawning over a 170 pound guy’s quads, I’m not really impressed. And it’s not just because he’s 170 pounds (though it doesn’t help). It’s because he severely lacks a posterior chain — hamstrings, adductors (groin), and gluteals. This isn’t relegated to males, because I see it equally in females.</p>
<p>Most of the CF training progressions are anterior chain dominant. There’s the air squat, front squat, and overhead squat. Press, push-press, and push-jerk. Deadlift, sumo deadlift high-pull, and med-ball clean. All of the squats are anterior chain dominant. The way that the push-press/jerk is taught is anterior dominant (bend knees). Other than the deadlift, the SDHP and med-ball clean typically turn into anterior chain movements. In reality, the deadlift is <em>supposed</em> to be a posterior chain movement, yet it hardly ever is (especially in almost all CF environments). Whether it’s fatigue, going to heavy too soon, or bad coaching, lumbar flexion is overly common in all of lifting, but especially CF, and this results in slack, non-working hamstrings. You can read more of my thoughts on this topic in <a href="/blog/2012/01/qa-13/" target="_blank">this Q&amp;A post</a>.</p>
<p>These teaching progressions aren’t necessarily bad, especially when compared to the lack of compound movements in the conventional fitness world, yet they don’t inherently build a posterior chain. Being an athlete requires a balance of musculature around the hips to achieve optimal performance and prevent injury. CrossFit is an activity that, for better or worse, allows trainees to ignore their muscular weaknesses and still “get by” or excel; you can have good CF performance and still have weak hamstrings.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see when someone has a weak posterior chain because their quads will be quite noticeable while the backs of their legs are not (you can see this in some weightlifters too). When they are in action, you’ll see them shift their mechanics to put an emphasis on using the quads and alleviating the tension on their hamstrings; it’s because their hamstrings are unable to withstand the load and tension due to lack of development.</p>
<p>When I work with CrossFitters I like them to peform two posterior chain movements each week, not counting deadlifts. My favorites to program are <a href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/" target="_blank">RDLs</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/05/banded-good-morning/" target="_blank">banded good mornings</a>, and glute-ham raises. Of course, regular good mornings could be used, and reverse hypers are very effective (though they are more focused on the lumbar/gluteal area than the hamstrings). Each movement can be done for 3 to 5 sets of 5 to 15 reps (depending on which exercise and the goal). Strengthening and building the posterior chain is the single most important thing athletes can do to improve their performance, and that’s infinitely more so for a CrossFitter.</p>
<p>As an example, my friend Shana Alverson is someone who has performed at a high level in CrossFit, is someone that has a pretty good posterior chain. At this point, she doesn’t do any direct accessory work, but she has a good balance of musculature (read: balance across anterior/posterior chains) that has yielded a 66kg snatch, 77 clean and jerk, 102kg squat, and 148kg deadlift at a 60kg body weight. It’s all paid off because she’s qualified for the CF Games for the 4th year in a row.</p>

  <p>Unless you’re a skinny teenager or a bulking Dave Tate, you don’t need to (and shouldn’t) eat like shit all of the time. Sure, it’s pretty cool to slam “dirty” food like a binging bulemic, but chronically doing so will have negative effects on your body composition, your health, and (ironically) more important, your training.</p>
<p>You’d think health would be most important, but clearly the majority of western society isn’t concerned with health when they put things into their mouth. Food quality is more important than the “lifting culture” admits. Choosing low-inflammatory foods that are dense with nutrients will curb systemic inflammation and therefore allow the body to devote all of its resources into training recovery and healing. Shitty food creates more work than the recovery work force can handle. Anyone who pretends to take their training seriously and doesn’t focus on food quality isn’t <a href="/blog/2012/04/start-taking-your-life-seriously-mate/" target="_blank">taking their life seriously</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="/blog/2011/07/eating-like-an-asshole/" target="_blank">there’s a place</a> for lower quality meals for the sake of consuming calories (or enjoyment). No, it should not be the norm. It’s possible to hit appropriate caloric and macro-nutrient demands with higher quality food, and anyone who claims otherwise is a poon and probably cries about how uncreative they are. Don’t be a dumbass; start eating better food.</p>

<p>I made this recipe up after finding a “Spicy Bourbon Pork” seasoning packet at the store. The package called for ribs in the oven. Instead, I used a slow cooker. You’ll need:</p>
<p>– boneless rib meat (at least 2 pounds)</p>
<p>– several sweet potatoes (at least 2)</p>
<p>– 2 gala apples</p>
<p>– seasoning (I used “spicy bourbon pork” seasoning)</p>
<p>– .5 to 1 cup of orange juice</p>
<p>– water</p>
<p>Slice the rib meat up if you want, but it will end up being so tender it’ll fall apart. Cut up the apples and sweet potatoes; they can be large pieces because they too will fall apart. Throw all that stuff in the cooker. Mix the seasoning with a bit of orange juice and water and then pour it over the meat/potato/apple combo. Cover and cook. Typically a slow cooker on ‘HIGH’ will be done in 4 to 6 hours while ‘LOW’ is kinda like 6 to 8. If you’re going to work and training all day, you probably want it on low.</p>
<p>Voilà. A non shitty meal that is “paleo”, has plenty of protein with quality carbohydrate sources. If you’re worried about insulin sensitivity or fructose density in your diet, just use less orange juice (or none at all). If you need more fat (extra calories for recovery), then just consume it with or after the meal. It’s not hard to eat good quality food, and you need to pay attention to what goes in your mouth if you want to look “jacked” instead of just “like some fat guy who puffs his chest out when he walks”. It’ll also make you tan.</p>

  <p>It’s been a hectic month, and things still aren’t normal. I’d like to formally thank Tom, Pete, Shannon, Shaun, and Shari for a lovely time in Australia. There are plenty of other assholes — like Stu, Josh, Sean, Jobbo, Kurt, Jeff, Steady, Sharpie, Gary, and plenty more that I’m forgetting — that made the trip heaps of fun. To all of you: stay in touch, train hard, eat well, and mob your genitals off.</p>
<p><em>Edit: I also have some good footage of a koala flipping his shit (literally and figuratively).</em></p>
<p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve had a formal day to post training updates and PRs, so make sure and do so. I’ll remind you that one of the coolest parts of this site is the interaction between the readers, and if you don’t actually post, you miss out on that indefinitely. I’d like you guys to point out any specific aspects of your programming that you think have helped out in the past several months. This could be a programming template, a mob, or an accessory movement.</p>
<p><strong>Pan American Championships</strong></p>
<p>The Pan Ams begin today and will mark the last chance any American men have at earning the single spot to the Olympics. Chad Vaughn has pulled out of this competition due to a groin injury — Chad had an excellent career and competed in the last two Olympic games and was a top 20 world competitor. Kendrick Farris is currently sitting in the driver’s seat for the single spot while Donny Shankle will try to hit massive numbers to earn the spot. More information on this throughout the day (after I train) as well as any streaming links. There may also be a live chat with the stream as well as current coverage of the competition. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> will provide the most updated coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Week In Review</strong></p>
<p>On Monday we talked about the “<a href="/blog/2012/05/banded-good-morning/" target="_blank">banded good morning</a>” (with video) and how it has immense utility in working the posterior chain, rehab, and a finisher that can aid recovery. I highly recommend it’s inclusion in most programs. On Tuesday we talked about how <a href="/blog/2012/05/prilepins-chart/" target="_blank">Prilepin’s Chart</a> can a trainee’s programming template to ensure appropriate doses of stress. There will be a follow up on using different intensities in the same training session. On Wednesday we took a look at the <a href="/blog/2012/05/london-94kg-battle/" target="_blank">94kg class</a> in preparation for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. It seems that Ilya Ilin and Artem Ivanov are hitting great numbers in training, and it could lead to a toe-to-toe battle in London.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>There won’t be a Q&amp;A this week, but feel free to ask questions for next week’s Q&amp;A in the comments. If it’s a simple question, some of the other readers may attempt at an answer, and I’ll take the best ones for next week’s column. I’ll also sift through some of the comments, e-mails, and messages I received while abroad and pick out the good ones.</p>

  <p>I took notice of how 2008 gold medalist Ilya Ilin (94kg) had charisma at the 2011 World Championships. I couldn’t decide if I liked him because he seemed to have a good time, but I could see him acting kind of like a dick towards his opponents. At one point, he hit a lift (I think it was his first or second clean and jerk) and as he was walking off the platform he gestured to an opposing lifter by throwing his palms upward as if to say, “What ya got, SON?!” He then smoked the hell out of a 226kg clean and jerk on his second attempt to win the world championship on body weight (because Artem Ivanov missed a WR 227kg clean and jerk on his third).</p>
<p>The other day I posted a video of Ilya hitting some shit-hot snatches (below), working up to 192.5kg (which I think is 4.5 above the WR). He looked ridiculously solid, but lifters typically do in training. They have the luxury to weigh more than their competition weight, but they are probably in the middle of some kind of drug cycle that inevitably has to be tapered for a competition. Nevertheless, it’s a significant improvement over his 181kg second attempt snatch from the 2011 World Championships.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Kevin P. commented on the video and said that the Ilya vs. Artem Ivanov battle would be a good one. He cited that Ivanov hit 190/230 in a competition recently in the Ukraine. I don’t know if there is video, but that’s a scary improvement over what he did at World’s in 2011. Watch <a href="http://youtu.be/HlJqEKVAF74" target="_blank">this video</a> and you’ll see his 186kg snatch, which was kind of hard, and his crack at 227 on his third CJ (there was no chance on the jerk, maybe because of the jump). Now watch his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrniua8R6mY" target="_blank">second attempt CJ at 221</a> and you’ll see an unstable jerk. It’s surprising that he can make such a stark improvement. However, maybe the “meet in Ukraine” didn’t drug test, and he’s humming on a cycle? I mean, c’mon, a 406 total to a 420 total?</p>
<p>I’d expect Ilya to improve upon his World Championship total because he missed a 184 snatch on his third, yet he cranked the hell out of his snatches up to 192.5 in the first video (shown above). I’d expect him to go at least 186, maybe 188? I guess it depends on what Ivanov is hitting. However, Ilya’s strength is in the CJ, and his potential wasn’t tapped in the World Championship last year. It’s almost scary how nonchalantly Ilya hits his CJs; <a href="http://youtu.be/F1o13d5znr8" target="_blank">this video</a> shows him easily hitting 230 (allegedly in response to Ivanov’s recent 190/230 meet). He’ll go for whatever he needs, and I think he’ll make it. I just don’t think Ivanov is going to have enough to beat Ilya.</p>
<p>If we base it off their performance at last year’s World’s and their potential to improve, Ilya clearly had weight left on the bar and Ivanov was clearly maxing out his potential. If they both have improvements, it would seem that Ilya will still have the edge. If Ivanov can hit similar numbers as his 190/230 meet (he won’t), it will be close, yet I think Ilya would still edge him on CJ after they go toe-to-toe on snatch. If Ivanov wins, it’d be a hell of an upset, but I don’t see it happening. There’s something about Ilya’s attitude about enjoying competition and training that will have me rooting for him when the showdown occurs in London. <a href="http://youtu.be/_uxn3RoqTOQ" target="_blank">Can’t wait</a>.</p>
