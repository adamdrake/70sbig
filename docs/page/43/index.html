  <p>Prileipin’s Chart is the result of a lot of Russian research done with Olympic weightlifters. It depicts the optimum number and range of reps given a certain percentage to increase strength. The researchers looked at bar speed, technique, and the lifter’s next competition max and developed the following numbers (for more on Prilepin’s Chart and it’s use on strength training, check out <a href="http://www.elitefts.com/documents/prilepins_chart.htm" target="_blank">this solid article</a> by Tim Kontos on EliteFTS).</p>
<p><a href="/2012/05/Prilepins-Chart.png"><img data-attachment-id="6774" data-permalink="/blog/2012/05/prilepins-chart/prilepins-chart/" data-orig-file="/2012/05/Prilepins-Chart.png" data-orig-size="391,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Prilepins Chart" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/05/Prilepins-Chart-200x99.png" data-large-file="/2012/05/Prilepins-Chart.png" src="/2012/05/Prilepins-Chart.png" alt="" title="Prilepins Chart" width="391" height="194" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6774" srcset="/2012/05/Prilepins-Chart.png 391w, /2012/05/Prilepins-Chart-150x74.png 150w, /2012/05/Prilepins-Chart-200x99.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></a></p>
<p>The “Percent” column indicates the percent of the lifter’s 1RM. The “Reps/sets” column represents the range of reps that can occur for a single set. The “Optimal” column shows the optimum number of total reps at this percent range to implement a correct dose of stress (fewer reps would be too low a stress, more reps would cause too much stress). The “Total Range” column indicates the lower and higher extremes a lifter could use when lifting in the indicated percent range. For example, the 55-65% row says that a lifter would use three to six reps per set, the optimal rep total is 24 reps, and the range of total reps is from 18 to 30. If the lifter used sets of 3, they could perform 8 sets to achieve the optimal 24 rep total.</p>
<p>This chart is a very good way to structure a training day, though it isn’t really necessary unless you’re more of an “advanced intermediate” type of lifter (i.e. someone who has been using intermediate programming for at least six months, and probably at least a year). Let’s say you found yourself going hard too often in your training, and de-loads were necessary and often. If you actually looked at your percentages and rep totals, you might find that you’re essentially doing three heavy days a week. Instead, you could fluctuate your week’s training better (perhaps with a Heavy-Medium-Light set up) by orienting your training sessions with Prilepin’s Chart.</p>
<p>If Monday you went heavy, the chart would help you see that “heavy” is anything over 90%. You’d do about four total reps by hitting a couple doubles or some singles, and you definitely wouldn’t breach the ten rep mark — it would just be superfluous training volume at this percentage. If you kept the rep ranges the same, you could aim to improve the weight slightly the following week. This is essentially what is done in the Texas Method and Advanced Texas Method protocols (though numbers of sets and reps are modified for goals, like raw powerlifting).</p>
<p>Prilepin’s Chart also allows for proper progression. If you’re less adapted to using its protocol, then you would stick to the lower end range of reps within a given percentage. For example, instead of using 15 to 20 reps in the 80-90% category, you’d stick to the lower rep range of 10 and build it up over time (perhaps adding a rep or two every week). You can see how it’s easy to apply more stress via total tonnage than simply adding weight, and this is also why you’d want to be more advanced before even worrying about any of this. Less adapted intermediates can make plenty of progress with a good training template and not over working themselves, but this Chart can corral those who are ignorant, belligerent, or not on a given template (hmm, two of those three describe Brent…).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.westside-barbell.com/" target="_blank">Westside Barbell</a> and Louie Simmons are the primary sources that educated the general strength population on Prilepin’s Chart. Louie based the DE/ME structure on these percentages and rep ranges and has tweaked them over the years (I’d suggest getting a copy of the “Westside Barbell Squat and Deadlift Manual” if you’re interested to see his implementation). Things are tweaked because a) the Westside lifters are using supportive gear and b) the above chart is based on the the quick Olympic lifts. Supportive gear will assist the lifter in his performance, so heavier percentages can be used. The Olympic lifts have a much lower time under tension and can be typically labeled as “sub-maximal” with respect to absolute strength, so a powerlifter or strength athlete will typically use fewer reps than an Olympic weightlifter. Also, Tim Kontos pointed out that a sport athlete (who is running, attending practice, or using a broader range of lifts) will use fewer reps so as not to apply too much stress that would inhibit the rest of the training.</p>
<p>Prilepin’s Chart is a good tool to use for experienced lifters, yet it can give a good programmer a strategy for how to plan his session, week, and training. Take a look at your own training and see how it compares with these rep ranges. If you decide to use it, remember to start with the lower rep ranges. If you experiment with something and it works well, then let us know (but include your stats and previous program). Don’t forget that less experienced lifters will complicate a good progression by trying to adhere to percentage-based training.</p>

  <p>I was teaching a seminar at <a href="http://shirespeedandstrength.com.au/" target="_blank">Shire Speed and Strength</a> in my first weekend in Australia when <a href="http://warriorperformance.com.au" target="_blank">Shannon Green</a> started talking about the banded good morning. He was suggesting them to an attendee who competed in MMA. In a world of deficient posterior chains, I fell in love with this movement immediately.</p>
<p>The banded good morning is done by wrapping a band around the base of the neck (not on the front, you can do it that way when you’re in your bedroom) while the other end is attached to the bottom of a rack several feet in front of you. It’s also possible to place both feet on the band, yet I think they are less useful this way. The exercise works the posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, and adductors), lumbar spine, upper back, and cervical spine. The only other neck assistance work specifically targets the area (neck harness extensions and neck bridges on a bench), so this is an excellent way to work the neck while training the posterior chain. After your first exposure, you’ll be sore in most of the area above the scapulae. I’ve pre-measured my neck to see if it increases the thickness over time.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1pMkMY4uM9k" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>When the band is on a rack, the force vector is downward and forward, which changes the trainee’s balance forward. The hips are pushed back with a neutral lumbar (this would be “extension” for tight people, “neutral” for very mobile people) to place tension on the hamstrings. Regardless of band loading, the trainee shouldn’t bend down so far that their lumbar unlocks or flexes; if the lumbar flexes, then the hamstrings slacken. This is a common error in the barbell GM or RDL; the trainee lowers the back below horizontal and flexes the lumbar or knees. In the banded GM on the rack, the trainee will only need to achieve a 45 degree back angle (or slightly more) to achieve good hamstring tension.</p>
<p>Also notice the emphasis on speed out of the bottom by driving through the band with the base of the neck. This can add an explosive component to the exercise — one that is also severely lacking in most trainees. This exercise can be used as a strength movement to increase the size, speed, and explosiveness in the posterior chain, but can also be used as a finisher to help aid recovery and improve muscular balance. Use 3 to 5 sets of 10 to 15 reps for strength, power, or muscle development. They are an excellent rehabilitation tool when used with lighter bands and higher reps (i.e. 3 to 5 sets of 20 to 30 reps).</p>
<p>Trainees can benefit from varying the GM’s in the same way that Westside Barbell varies their lifts. Use wide stance, close stance, point the toes out, change the speed (but do them explosively at least 75% of the time) and use different band tensions and placements. My only criteria would be to maintain band tension at the bottom of the movement. If you’re in a pinch, or want a variation, try the version in which you <a href="http://youtu.be/fTxTFVELEzQ" target="_blank">stand on the band</a>. I’ve done them this way, but I think they are better when attached to a rack because it provides a unique angle of tension.</p>
<p>Again, this is an excellent exercise that I am in love with. If I could marry and divorce an exercise, this would be it. It can be thrown in at the end of any type of training day. They are perfect for CrossFitters given that CF often results in a very anterior dominant trainee (developed quads, no posterior chain). I would suggest their inclusion at least once a week, but they can be done up to 3 times a week (depending on when/if you pull). If you don’t regularly deadlift, then use a higher frequency. Lastly, the balance is weird when performing them, so be careful that you don’t do a fucking header into the rack. I’d like 70’s Big to remain death free.</p>

  <p>There are many people who write about weightlifting in the USA, but they don’t always agree with each other. There are intricacies in the set-up or pull that will set some coaches on opposing sides of the battlefield. Despite these differences, there are still aspects of programming and mechanics that should be universal. My pal Jacob Tsypkin, the hated YouTube sensation, does a nice job of summarizing these “truths” that should be accepted as self evident. Jacob has been learning and training under <a href="http://pendlayforum.com/" target="_blank">Glenn Pendlay</a> at <a href="http://www.californiastrength.com/" target="_blank">California Strength</a>; he will be a very good weightlifting coach in the future.</p>
<p>Below are five important concepts that, when followed, will yield appropriate training and execution. Read the full article on <a href="http://tsypkin.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/general-philosophy-for-development-of.html" target="_blank">Jacob’s blog/site</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#1: Position Is Everything</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>#2: Mechanics, Consistency, Intensity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>#3: Regularly train at or near maximal weights</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>#4: Everything which is not a competition style snatch or C&amp;J is an assistance exercise</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>#5: Never stop doing the full lifts. Ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that these concepts are specific to an Olympic weightlifter; some may not apply to a general strength and power trainee. Do you think Jacob left any important concepts out? What else would you add?</p>

  <p>I went to the Australian Sport and Fitness Expo this past weekend, and it was glaringly unimpressive. Conventional fitness and nutrition information still maintains precedence, and the culture reflects that. Thankfully, Derek Boyer was present. Derek is a long-time strongman competitor, powerlifter, Guinness World Record holder, and actor. He’s even dabbled in some sumo wrestling and won the 2011 Oceania Open Championship as well as a multi-national powerlifting champion. A few years ago he was on Australian Gladiators, and he’s undefeated in every Australia’s Strongest Man since 1997. He’s qualified for the World’s Strongest man 8 times with his first appearance in <a href="http://youtu.be/j9CkPcGlAKY" target="_blank">1996</a>. Derek is THE strongman authority in Australia.</p>
<p>He put on a demonstration by lifting a V8 engine and carrying it around (see video below). Unfortunately, the weakling Aussie goobers standing around didn’t have an appreciation for this feat.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkv6HuE8dV0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>I chatted with Derek a bit after the demonstration. Recently he hasn’t focused on powerlifting, yet he deadlifted 370kg. However, another Aussie guy (the name escapes me) deadlifted 372.5. Derek has vowed to not only crush this number, but to deadlift 400kg by the end of the year. If I recall correctly, he deadlifted 360 or 365 last week in his second pulling session, and the first session he did 330 or 340 for a triple. Not too shabby, eh?</p>
<p>It was refreshing to chat with Derek in a sea of CrossFit, bodybuilding, and supplements. If you’d like to read more about Derek, as well as watch some impressive videos, then visit <a href="http://www.derekboyer.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.DerekBoyer.com">www.DerekBoyer.com</a></a> and check out <a href="http://boyerweightloss.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.BoywerWeightLoss.com">www.BoywerWeightLoss.com</a></a> for his weight loss program.</p>

  <p>When 70’s Big began, it was a stark contrast to several workout themes that were popular online. First, it was a detraction from the CrossFit/Zone and conventional fitness mentality that resulted in a man being a waif. Men are supposed to be burly and brawny. They shouldn’t be fat nor a willowy stalk, but instead own a stature of impressiveness. Secondly, our philosophy focused on achieving such a physique through the trials of strength training as opposed to aesthetic focused training. It’s easy to identify a lifter from the upper body boys that populate most fitness gyms; the lifter’s muscular structure carries broad traps, a bouldered back, and evenly tree-trunked legs.</p>
<p>There were other themes early on, like encouraging competition and opening the door to females to train, but the emphasis of the site started with extending one middle finger upward to the societal norm while the other fist powered skyward (or into another man’s face in slow motion). Our core group of guys that inspired the website trained hard and ate lots, yet we were all in our early twenties. The dietary intake the focuses on mass caloric intake isn’t something that can or should be sustained in the long term. It’s time to <a href="http://youtu.be/zVT_o1LVHIY" target="_blank">sort your fucking life out, mate</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve adapted this phrase for use in the workshops in Australia. If someone acknowledges they aren’t using mobility appropriately, eating well, or doing something that would help their recovery, I’ll say, “Well, it’s time to start taking your life seriously, mate.” It’s most often used regarding dietary topics, since most guys aren’t putting much effort into what they eat.</p>
<p>If you agree with the above philosophy — that a strong, muscular, and athletic athletic man is most impressive — then ignoring food quality won’t get you there (or if it has, it won’t keep you there). Here are some topics that I’ve been developing with my mate <a href="http://warriorperformance.com.au/" target="_blank">Shannon</a> that can help you start taking your dietary life more seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Eat A Stronger Brekkie</strong></p>
<p>Your first meal of the day will help tweak and control your hormones and therefore energy levels. If you don’t eat anything, then start eating a fat/protein rich meal. If you rely on whey protein, as I used to, then have some eggs or meat. The carb content doesn’t need to be extraordinary unless you’re training early in the morning. If you don’t have much time, then prepare an egg casserole or meat the night before. It also doesn’t take long to cook a few eggs that you can throw down the hatch along with some whey (with the point being that “meat + whey” is better than whey alone). Remember to get a quality fat source via eggs or oil (coconut or olive) — your afternoon energy level will thank you.</p>

<p>If you eat the same thing every day, then aim to vary up your food choices. We base everything in training on the stress/adaptation cycle; if you accept this, then it shouldn’t be absurd to think that your body won’t get adapted to a monotonous diet. The same goes for meat choices; if you only eat ground beef, try out another animal like lamb or pork. Get different cuts and see how many animals you can eat in a week. I’m less of a fan of turkey and chicken, but different protein sources will provide balance in a diet.</p>
<p>Also, if you eat the same types of meals every day, then see if you can vary them up. Always have a shake mid-morning and a solid meal at lunch? Occasionally switch them up. You’re probably not developing a food intolerance, but the variety will prevent it. Oh, and if you are eating “clean” and not having any change in your body composition (especially having an improvement at first), then you need to vary it yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>The Carbohydrate Continuum</strong></p>
<p>A lifter doesn’t actually need a lot of carbohydrates to function. Training for an hour or two is not enough to deplete muscle glycogen stores, despite what stupid-ass bodybuilding mags might claim. However, carbs are useful for spiking insulin, an anabolic hormone. However, the trainee needs to have a healthy sensitivity to insulin for this “spike” and anabolic effect to work. Trainees who do lots of high intensity conditioning and endurance athletes will need a larger carbohydrate intake (relative and absolute) given that they are tapping into that substrate source, but a lifter doesn’t require them to fuel their training (other than as maintenance and caloric content). Have carbs densely around the training session, yet getting them through vegetable sources throughout the day will help the sensitivity to insulin and also provide a lot of quality nutrients to help with systemic inflammation. Remember that “systemic inflammation” is exacerbated with crappy food and it will inhibit your recovery.</p>
<p><strong>A Nice Stone Glass of…</strong></p>
<p>Don’t like vegetables? Lamenting about not eating brownies every night? Can’t eat enough calories if it’s all clean food? Look, you aren’t Michael Phelps; the maximum effective range of an excuse is zero meters. This isn’t just about properly fueling your body to recover optimally about training, it’s also setting you up so you can train (and do dirty things to your wife) when you’re an old, yet jacked, geezer. Start taking your life seriously, mate.</p>

  <p>If you have followed 70’s Big you’ll know that there is typically a post on every week day. Currently I’m in Australia hanging with some fantastic people, doing neat things, and eating good food. The frequency of posts will dip slightly as I’m gone, but I have some good content for you.</p>
<p>With that being said, I suggest that Americans from the U.S. make an effort to visit another country. Sydney is still has a similar culture and lifestyle, yet it has many unique traits. In countries like the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Australia, the governments function in a way that results in a free citizen. None of the governments are perfect, of course, and we can point to policy that limits our removes freedom, but generally speaking we are free to live how we want and are able to partake in luxury. Part of that luxury is that we are free of the worry of how to obtain or maintain freedom. We don’t have to care about the functioning of our government, foreign policy, or what else is going on the world because our respective governments won’t mess things up too much to force me to pay attention. Some of you may disagree, but the end result is that people only have to worry about themselves. This egotism is especially prevalent in American culture since it’s not as common to travel to other countries (I know people who have never left their own state, much less the border of the U.S.).</p>
<p>In the two trips I’ve been here, I’ve grown to have an appreciation of humanity. Sydney is interesting because the people that populate it are different. The proximity of Australia to Asia, the pacific Islands, and even the Middle East creates a different melting pot. However, it also seems that there are more Europeans that visit or live here, and a lot of folks here eventually travel abroad. My experience is that they seem a bit more “worldly” than people in the U.S., and I think that’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>I will say this: Australians are great fucking people. They have a good sense of humor, they’re not sensitive, and they are extremely generous. Hanging out with Australians in any setting is always a good time, and if you visit, make sure to try and make some friends (the other night, a bloke who doesn’t train that I was with was offered a cigarette, and he looked at me before saying defiantly, “No, we’re elite athletes.”). I’d like to thank and commend Tom Vale, <a href="http://warriorperformance.com.au/" target="_blank">Shannon Green</a>, and <a href="http://shirespeedandstrength.com.au/" target="_blank">Peter Upham</a> for entertaining this unworthy American.</p>
<p>And fuck me drunk, son, the food is good here. That aforementioned melting pot with a large population means there are a plethora of places to eat. Yesterday I had octopus tentacles right before having lamb skewers (yes, it was a grilled version of <a href="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/304354/304354,1263135930,2/stock-photo-octopus-tentacle-44191852.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>). They don’t have smoked meat and chili, but there’s some damn fine food here to make a trip worth it.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you make it to another country. I haven’t been to many, but I know I enjoy Australia quite a bit. Immersing yourself in another culture will make you appreciate the diversity in humanity, but it lets you appreciate the freedom you have in being able to safely experience it all. GLHF.</p>

  <p>A program is a program is a program is a program, right? Nah, that ain’t me. We know that programs aren’t created equal, but it’s not because one is necessarily better than another. It’s because one is better for an individual or group of similar individuals. This is one concept I teach when I travel to do 70’s Big Workshops along with providing the thought process behind programming.</p>
<p>Peter Upham of Shire Speed and Strength hosted a workshop again, and on Tuesday I was working with one of his athletes. Sean is a “gridiron” (AKA American football) player who is on an interesting training template. It’s a template that fits his available schedule and needs. Peter is unique in that he is the head coach of his gridiron team in addition to owning a gym that coaches many different types athletes. He likes to utilize the Olympic lifts for football players, and it is clearly paying off since Sean’s older brother, Blake, started at left tackle as a freshman at the University of Hawaii. (On a side note, I saw Blake lift last year, and he’s pretty impressive).</p>
<p>These athletes aren’t doing the full Olympic lifts to compete in the sport, but instead to improve their explosiveness and flexibility for football. In other words, they aren’t specialist. The program that Sean is on still has him low bar back squatting and benching along with two days of conditioning that prepare him for the sport. Watch the following video for a description of the program:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FAr3wTj3gN0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The first conditioning day is more focused on all out efforts with complete rest. The second day is more of a work capacity day, and as it gets closer to the season it emulates the intervals of a football game (resting 35 to 40 seconds between sprints up a sand hill, for example). Notice that the program is simple, trains the whole body, and accomplishes the goal of turning a young, lesser experienced fella into a powerful, strong football player. The only thing I suggested as an addition was some more posterior chain work (perhaps in the form of good mornings with the band around the neck — more on these later).</p>
<p>Programs don’t have to be complicated to do well. This is an example of one for a specific individual in a specific situation with specific goals, yet the program could be followed by general strength trainees with equal success.</p>

  <p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Post your training updates and PR’s to the comments. If you’re a regular poster (especially if you’re funny), then I take more of my time to help you if you ever have any questions. Plus, when you actually post, you get immersed into this community. The guys that loiter here are all really good guys and can help you with your training. Let us know how this week went in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Week In Review</strong></p>
<p>On Monday I did the first <a href="/blog/2012/04/female-mobility-case-study/" target="_blank">Mobility Case Study on a female lifter</a> named Tamara. The post includes two videos (<a href="http://youtu.be/SPpAECK8jFs" target="_blank">long</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/kWNwURA3hM4" target="_blank">short</a> version) explaining her mobility prescription, yet most of you could benefit from the same “mobs”. On Tuesday, Dr. Kilgore, co author of <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a></strong>, climbed out of his Scottish ale/research house to write an <a href="/blog/2012/04/risk-managed-out-of-health-fitness/" target="_blank">editorial on risk management and how it relates to fitness</a>. On Thursday I gave you some insight as to <a href="/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/" target="_blank">why it’s important to learn and use anatomy</a> in the fitness or strength and conditioning realm. Then I traveled for about 30 hours and my luggage didn’t make it with me, so I’ll just keep wearing the same clothes, it’s fine.</p>

<p>I’m pretty knackered from the flight into Oz, so I’m gonna try and stick to simple to answer questions this week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I do some mob work for my internal hip rotation, the inner side of my knee hurts. What is this and how do I deal with it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Cory,</p>
<p>It would depend on the type of mob that you’re doing. If you’re doing <a href="http://ericcressey.com/2009/03/lyingknee-to-kneestretch-300x225.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> (from Eric Cressey’s site), then it would be easy to see why the medial knee would be stressed. Have you tried doing the anterior banded distraction on the proximal hip, then kicking the foot out to the side a little (which internally rotates the hip), and then mobbing as normal (typically by contracting the glutes and sinking hips forward)? Your positioning and general tightness will have an effect on medial knee pain. Also keep in mind that the gracilis is the only hip internal rotator that crosses the knee, and it does so on the medial side. Perhaps you are mobbing correctly and the gracilis is strangely tight? I would assume you’re doing a mob wrong or something that you shouldn’t be doing, but you could also work the adductors and gracilis by rolling on a PVC.</p>

<p>Dear Jonathan,</p>
<p>I have been meaning to do some videos with them. Sadly, I am in Australia right now for several weeks and I miss the pups very much. I do have some video on my computer, so I’ll put something together when I get some down time. They are really funny and cute, but I’m obviously biased.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s some good mobility movements to help someone keep their shoulders back when cleaning the bar? My shoulder likes to roll forward and I have to fight like hell to keep them back and pinching the lats together is also difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Kurt,</p>
<p>Sounds like you need to search “<a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/?s=front+rack" target="_blank">front rack</a>” on MWOD. If your shoulder and thoracic mobility is shitty, then start working on it. Search, find, and complete “5 way shoulder” as well. In the mean time, your grip might be funky. If you have long arms, especially long forearms, widen the grip a few finger widths. Think “elbows up and in”. The “in” part puts the shoulder in external rotation; internal rotation would promote that “shoulders rolled forward” position you’re trying to avoid while external rotation puts the shoulders back and down in their efficient spot. Update me on your progress.</p>

<p><em>Anthony R. asks</em></p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any recommendations for a beggner weightlifter who has trouble with locking the legs completely before second pull of clean? No trouble with it on snatch though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Anthony,</p>
<p>It sounds like you need to learn and execute a progression. Teaching progressions typically account for this kind of thing before hand. I recommend checking out Glenn Pendlay’s teaching progression. Reduce the weight and do the progression un-weighted and then weight it slightly and complete it again (he should explain that in the videos). Update me on your progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tom H. asks,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can anyone recommend any videos on how to snatch and clean and jerk properly? Triple extension vs catapult, brush vs bang, how much my feet should move, ‘rebending the knees in the scoop’… My head is spinning from so much material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t worry so much on the discrepancy of techniques. Instead, just start learning the efficient one by watching videos on <a href="http://californiastrength.com/videos/viewcategory/12/olympic-weightlifting" target="_blank">California Strength’s site</a>. Stop thinking and just do the progressions and work from there. Update me on your progress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m a crosfitter that works in strength cycle on my own. I usually have success with 5-3-1 and use that for 3 months on and 1 off for rest cycle and to give myself a mental break from the work on top of standard crossfit sessions. I have noticed that if I go more than 3-4 weeks without heavy back squat or deadlift I struggle with the motor plan, mechanics and general feel for the heaviness. Is this to be expected? Should I stay more consistent with 3 weeks on/1 week off regularly to avoid this fall off? Following the standard of squatting 2x/week and deadlifting once is hard to fit in without overtaxing myself given the long list of crossfit things to work on. I wonder if I am trying to bite off more than I can chew. I like lifting heavy, just not the loss of numbers after a rest period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Josh,</p>
<p>I don’t know what your goals are. If they aren’t competing in CrossFit then you CrossFit too much if it’s included on every strength training day. This doesn’t mean I think you shouldn’t do CrossFit or that I think strength training is better, it’s that if your goal is to be well conditioned and strong, then your balance is off in the programming.</p>
<p>You reference going almost a month without heavy squatting or deadlifting and notice that the neuromuscular efficiency is off. You already know it’s because you haven’t done it. You won’t maintain a neurological and physiological (to include the cardiovascular system) adaptation to lifting heavy if you don’t do it.</p>
<p>I don’t know what type of meal you’re trying to eat, but, yes, you are biting off more than you can chew. Let me say that again: you are trying to do too much shit and you could be more efficient. Again, this doesn’t mean I don’t think you should do or use CrossFit, but if you don’t define a goal, then this will soon get ugly (you aren’t decreasing in age). I respectfully inform you that it sounds like you need to improve on what you have done in the recent past, regardless of your goal.</p>
<p>Okay, I’m still fucking KNACKERED and I have a workshop in the morning. Have a jolly weekend.</p>

  <p>I’ve had pain in to the left of my spine, a little inferior (below) the scapula and just lateral of the vertebrae, off and on over the last year. It’s often not debilitating, but it will get worse when I sit for long periods of time. I have strained several times where I couldn’t train for a few sessions. I did it in January when I was playing Skyrim, and another time it happened when I was front squatting in Texas (2010, I think). The earliest I ever strained it was before I even did CrossFit, so that must have been in 2007 (I was doing a dumbbell row). I have a slight curve to my thoracic spine which would probably explain why the erector spinae muscles on that side have issues. Most people have a small degree of scoliosis that is hardly noticeable without an x-ray.</p>
<p>I’ve tried a lot of different things from Mobility WOD, and they helped, but the pain still lingers. I used two parts from “5 way shoulder” (specifically a) flexion and external rotation to stretch the lats and b) the cross-chest stretch in external rotation that pulls the scapula away from the spine. They helped, and my thoracic flexibility improved (to the point that those stretches don’t accomplish as much anymore), but I still have the pain. I’ve noticed that sometimes I tend to slightly over extend at my thoracic/lumbar junction and my sacro/lumbar junction in an attempt to not slouch. This could be something that makes it worse. When I laterally flex to my right side, the left side feels stretched and alleviated. Also, if I push my left ribs to the right, and push my right hip to the left, I get an overt stretching sensation along the lower erector muscles.</p>
<p>All of the above is to give you an idea of the data I’ve collected on this injury and how it could help me work on it to improve it. Deep rooted types of pain or injuries will not respond as well to merely stretching them, and there aren’t really any joints to approximate in the spine (like you can do with the shoulder, elbow, hip and knee). This is a long term issue, so if I’m going to penetrate deeper into the tissue, I will need to use a lacrosse ball and at least my own body weight laying on top of it. I can increase the amount of weight by using a weight (plate, dumbbell, dog, etc.) on my chest. However, what I do while on that lacrosse ball is important.</p>

<p>Look at the three muscle groupings that make up the erector spinae. Some are right next to the spine while others fan out and attach on the ribs. By knowing what’s going on under the skin, I can better attack these muscles to alleviate their “deep rooted” problem. It may be that my anatomical assymetry (slightly curved thoracic spine) has helped them get tight, or it might be that they have gotten tight from how I sit at my computer and drive (likely). Someone might look at this and say I have a muscular imbalance. Yes, there’s an imbalance, but not necessarily due to a “weakness”. If there’s a weakness (and I don’t think there is), it’s due to the chronically tight position, not the other way around. Or, there might be some ROM limitations that result in a a weakness (the same way that if your biceps couldn’t move through the full ROM, it’d look or feel like a weakness).</p>
<p>Instead of just laying on a ball and just mashing stuff around, instead I should have a plan. How can I have an effect on these particular muscles to relieve tension, let them slide over one another, or function better? Let’s move along the muscle belly. I hadn’t really focused on moving along the muscle belly of these erectors until last night, and the effect was instantly noticeable. I tried tack and stretching medial to the scap as well as inferior to the scap, but it never really produced the effect. However, after looking at the muscle attachment sites and looking at a trigger point therapy book I have, I realized I hadn’t moved along the muscle belly. I worked from above the pain, towards it, on it, and then below it, and I freed up those tissues and had an instant relief of pain. Neato.</p>
<p>If you are a coach or if you lift alone, improving your anatomy knowledge is important in your ability to prevent and treat injuries or “issues”. Obviously I think anatomical knowledge is important for understanding the lifts themselves, but that’s pretty easy to grasp. To understand injuries and how to rehab and treat them, you need an understanding of the smaller details. Knowing “hamstring” and “quad” isn’t enough; you need to know where those muscles attach (like how the hamstrings wrap around the head of the tibia after crossing the knee).</p>
<p>My little epiphany also brings up the point that if you know the muscular anatomy, then you know how to work on it with a lacrosse ball. Instead of blindly smashing on tissues, work along their muscle bellies. There are instances when feathering over the muscle perpendicular to how the fibers run is necessary (like when working on the TFL after carrying a heavy pack on your back), yet there I bet most instances work better when you move parallel with the fibers — especially when there is a long muscle belly like in the erector spinae group. Think about other muscles that have long bellies: quadriceps, hamstrings, biceps, back muscles, and the forearms. If you have pain in a region, then see what happens if you move “upstream” and “downstream” of that pain with careful, controlled undulations on a lacrosse ball. But before you do, learn the anatomy of the structure so you know where to put that lacrosse ball.</p>
<p>My favorite musculoskeletal anatomy book is the “Trail Guide to the Body”, a book made for PTs and massage therapists. I had to get it in school, and it’s phenomenal. I’ve heard other people cite other anatomy books, but nothing has the detail, muscle action, origin/insertion, and how to palpate every structure like this book. There’s a 4th edition out, but you can find the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=trail+guide+to+the+body+3rd+edition" target="_blank">3rd edition</a> for pretty cheap (I just bought another copy for $15, which is an absolute steal).</p>

<p>I use this book every time someone asks me an injury question. The good thing is that every time I get a question, I review what I’ve learned in the past by studying the area again. It helps me learn how to rehab things (by getting the muscle to contract) as well as how to mob things (as I described above). Combine this book with “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Without-Scalpel-Dr-Kilgore/dp/0615390722" target="_blank">Anatomy Without A Scalpel</a>” and you’re set up to have a good understanding of musculoskeletal anatomy.</p>
<p>I’m surprised to learn how many coaches and lifters do not have a good understanding of anatomy. Make it a point to improve this understanding because it will heighten your understanding of lifting mechanics, but also help with injuries and mobility work.</p>
