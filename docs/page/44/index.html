  <p><em>Today’s post is written by Dr. Lon Kilgore, research leader and senior lecturer at the <a href="http://www.uws.ac.uk/schoolsdepts/science/sports-studies/LonKilgore.asp" target="_blank">University of the West of Scotland</a> and co-author of <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a></strong>, a no-nonsense book on effective fitness that we wrote with Dr. Michael Hartman.</em></p>
<p><strong>Risk Managed out of Health &amp; Fitness</strong></p>
<p><em>by Dr. Lon Kilgore</em></p>
<p>I was recently told by a university administrator that I wasn’t allowed to move classroom desks (weighing in at a whopping 5kg) as it was a health and safety issue. Apparently, as a faculty member, I’m not trained or qualified to safely move physical objects of any mass greater than a dry erase marker. If I was to be injured moving something as simple schoolroom chair, I would not be eligible for sick leave benefits.</p>

<p>The basic principle this illustrates is that we live in an aggressively and progressively risk averse world. The fear is upon us. The fear of risk exposure, the fear of litigation, the fear of failure, the fear of injury, the fear of disease, and the fear of pain. I should say that the fear is thrust upon us by those who believe they know what is best for us; politicians, lobbyists, law enforcement, professional organizations, lawyers, clinicians, insurance companies, the press, and even our neighbors.</p>
<p>So how does fear and risk management relate to compromised health and fitness?</p>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Let’s look first at one well known example of health &amp; safety measures inducing an unintended health result. We’ve all been told since we were kids don’t put that in your mouth, keep out of that mud puddle, don’t get dirty, you touched that so go wash your hands, and more. We have become an overwhelmingly clean society, afraid to touch anything resembling dirt or to be dirty in order to not be infected by the reportedly rampant germs present everywhere. But that is supposed to be good isn’t it? Cleanliness, that is. Yes, it assists in reducing disease transmission. Keeping equipment, mats, and floors clean absolutely helps prevent gym outbreaks of staphylococcus aureus and other contact transmissible pathogen infections. BUT an unintended effect of clean is that our kids, well, all of us are no longer exposed to environmental allergens, the things that were in the dirt (but weren’t germs), the dirt we were supposed to avoid or clean away to keep healthy. We all know the concept of biological adaptation elucidated by Selye or more famously recognized in Neitsche’s “that which does not destroy me makes me stronger” quote. To become more survivable we have to be exposed to a homeostatic disruption (that’s how vaccinations work). In the case of a super clean society, the absent exposure to allergens has resulted in a maladaptation, asthma. The being too clean or hygiene hypothesis has been around for a while and hasn’t really been broadly accepted as it doesn’t seem to fit with our concept that sterile environments are safe and healthy, preventing infection and allergy (think of all the hygiene signs and regulations of which you are aware). But very new data just published in Science suggests that childhood exposure to pathogens and allergens reduce the life-long inventory of invariant natural killer cells in the body, having many of these cells is linked to asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. We have developed as a culture to assume that we are managing the risk of infection in our children’s health by bringing them up with virtually no exposure to “dirt”, but when we are never required to adapt physiologically to our environment, we are setting up conditions prime for development of auto-immune pathologies … unless we want to be the boy in the bubble.</p>
<p>Getting back to the fitness aspect, this same principle of lack of exposure exists in the fitness arena as well. I can’t move a 5kg chair at work by regulation. Skateboarding, BMX biking, and Parkour are illegal by most urban codes as they pose a risk to health and safety. The American Academy of Pediatrics, while acknowledging the large benefits of children training with weights, and while acknowledging that data suggests that it is healthy and much safer than average exercise, recommends against powerlifting, weightlifting, bodybuilding, high intensity, and progressive training for those same children as they may be at increased risk of injury (even though they acknowledge there is no data to support this position).</p>
<p>Everywhere we turn, someone or some group with incomplete information and who is very short sighted has placed a limitation, regulation, or practical barrier to being physically active as part of our work and play. Ostensibly, this is because they believe they are protecting us from ourselves, who apparently want to act irresponsibly by being physically active or by just doing our jobs. In the context of preventing us from being physically active, they have done the opposite. No physical activity means that we cannot adapt to the stress of our occupation, of daily life, or towards supporting a health recreational life. In a very practical sense, risk management and safety policies, operations, and conventions seem to be functioning counter to their intent in respect to what a prohibitive approach does to the physiology of the human body.</p>
<p>What’s the solution? Anarchy? Civil disobedience? Occupy? Protest? Political Action?</p>
<p>Probably the best solution is to simply get to the gym … planned and progressive exercise is much better and more efficient at reaping the physiological and health benefits we want than randomly placed physical activity within a workday.</p>

  <p>This “Mobility Case Study” is on my pal, the beloved Tamara. Many of you know who she is because she posts on the internet at least 37 times a day. I think some of you misunderstand her because you think she’s a pain in the ass. In any case, she likes me because I’m a pain in her ass (figuratively, not literally).</p>
<p>Tamara has a host of mobility issues that I can sum up in saying that she’s “jacked up”. Not in that “she’s so muscular” kind of way, but more along the lines of “she moves like <a href="http://youtu.be/IfFW-Yezv0k" target="_blank">James Harrison</a> was getting paid to hurt her” kind of way. Let me show you:</p>
<p><a href="/2012/04/tamara-85k-clean.png"><img data-attachment-id="6705" data-permalink="/blog/2012/04/female-mobility-case-study/tamara-85k-clean/" data-orig-file="/2012/04/tamara-85k-clean.png" data-orig-size="292,218" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="tamara 85k clean" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/04/tamara-85k-clean-200x149.png" data-large-file="/2012/04/tamara-85k-clean.png" src="/2012/04/tamara-85k-clean.png" alt="" title="tamara 85k clean" width="292" height="218" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6705" srcset="/2012/04/tamara-85k-clean.png 292w, /2012/04/tamara-85k-clean-150x111.png 150w, /2012/04/tamara-85k-clean-200x149.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /></a></p>
<p>In this picture you can see her toes out, knees tracking in, left knee shifting medially, and her right knee pushed forward inside of her right foot (with the assumed collapsed arch in the feet). Nonetheless, she’s decently strong for a 36 year old woman with a history of knee problems and only lifting for a couple of years. Tamara is primarily an Olympic weightlifter who front squats and low bar squats a lot. Recently she hurt the radial ligaments of her right wrist while missing a clean. As a result, she can’t rack a front squat without pain and has been using safety bar to squat. This flared up her peroneals (lateral portion of the shin) on her right leg. She also has a pretty crappy bottom position in the snatch.</p>
<p>Here are some videos of a heavy <a href="http://youtu.be/29MBPBFUKcY" target="_blank">clean</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUabnRsDR0o&#038;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">snatch</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30kbxFbc2ms&#038;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">front squat</a> — you can see how the mobility limits her. She’s losing a lot of her force application due to the inefficiency. In other words, all of her strength is not being applied to the specific movement of each lift.</p>
<p>This stuff is hard to talk about in text, so I made a video that analyzes Tamara’s faults and provides a “mobility prescription” on what she needs to improve. There is a short and long version. The short version is just the intro and the summary; the long version shows all of the elaborations on what she needs to do (it’s specific to her, but will apply to everyone else).</p>
<p>Short video:</p>

</div>

<p>Tamara’s chronic positional issues need to be rectified if she’s going to improve her lifting efficiency. She can address the specific acute instance of peroneal pain by working on the peroneals, but she needs to address the underlying cause by improving her mobility in her hips, knees, and ankles. I recommend that she:</p>
<p>– work on her external rotators with a lacrosse ball (while keeping the hip in flexion, like the bottom of a squat) for at least two minutes each side, every time she trains</p>
<p>– use anterior joint distraction at her hip with a band for 1 to 2 minutes each side (and each leg), contracting and releasing her glute and “exploring the joint capsule” (as Kelly says) to find her tight spots. She can also contract the glute and then a) sink the hips forward or b) rotate the torso to find her end ROM</p>
<p>– use the two couch stretch variants after doing the joint distraction. This will free up the muscle belly of the quadriceps so that the couch stretch opens them up better. There are two variants: a) keeping hands on floor, torso horizontal and sink the hips forward with contracted glute and b) posting up so that the torso is vertical, which will open everything up from the hip to the knee. In both variants, keep the lower abdominals tight to avoid anterior hip rotation.</p>
<p>– Tack and stretch the supra-patellar pouch of the distal quadriceps (right above the knee and patella). This helps alleviate tension at the knee from the superior aspect (above it).</p>
<p>– Anterior and posterior joint distraction at the ankle while going into dorsiflexion and lightly pushing the shin lateral with respect to the foot</p>
<p>– Lacrosse ball work to free up the foot arches while using foot strengthening exercises to help establish the arch integrity over time.</p>
<p>Tamara has a lot of stuff to work on. Typically these things are important for everybody, but they are more important for her since her lack of mobility is causing problems in other places. In this case, her lack of hip/knee/ankle mobility is causing peroneal pain due to the weird knee torsion that occurs. If she works on them diligently, we can expect her to improve her overall ROM and subsequently the efficiency in her lifting.</p>

  <p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Post your training updates and PR’s to the comments. This is a great way for you to interact with other 70’s Big readers. I think this community is very cool and I’ve met a lot of the guys that post here; they can provide friendship, a good laugh, or at least encouragement in your training. Only one or two are mouth breathing creeps.</p>
<p>Also, if you post regularly then I’m more inclined to go out of my way to help you. I’ll also be ‘rewarding’ a few of the regulars with training logs on the site soon. What I’m saying is that if you post on PR Friday, it will enhance your experience with this site and you’ll get more out of it. Let us know how your week of training went.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Recap</strong></p>
<p>Monday I talked about <a href="/blog/2012/04/boobs/" target="_blank">boobs and other boob topics</a>. Tuesday I showed you that <a href="/blog/2012/04/the-evolution-of-chris/" target="_blank">Chris started as an average lifter</a> and has worked his ass off to be as strong as he is today. Then my pal Brooks Conway wrote a good <a href="/blog/2012/04/cutting-weight-for-a-meet/" target="_blank">article on cutting weight</a> before a lifting meet. Yesterday we admired the <a href="/blog/2012/04/russians-going-off/" target="_blank">Russian ability to be stronger</a> than a redneck’s heritage pride.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Reading List</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]I am finishing Joe Abercrombie’s “The Heroes” and highly recommend it, though I suggest reading the preceding four books to fully appreciate it (see my thoughts on the other books from <a href="/blog/2012/03/qa-24/" target="_blank">last week</a>). What books have you guys been reading?</p>

<p>“If the lifter is in a meet, then it’s probably in their best interest to abuse the rules and use their boobs to decrease the total ROM that they have to move the bar. Note that I think this is “jelly dick” behavior”- Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Angdesj,</p>
<p>Just so everyone else knows, angdesj is a very good female bencher (200 pounds at something like a sub 150 pound BW). She lowers the bar to her nipple line, but her boob size isn’t so massive that it significantly reduces the ROM of the bench (perhaps two inches at the most, but more like an inch). But she does it that way because that’s the ROM she was taught. I assume she wasn’t taught this way to take advantage of the boobs being there (but I could be wrong). Anyway, I deem the above “jelly dick” because when there’s a blatant attempt at bending the rules, it bothers me. I don’t know, I think it makes the person a chump, though it’s within the rules. Two examples against me would be sumo deadlifting and pre ’72 pressing. Sumo deadlifting decreases the ROM to do a deadlift. I don’t really think it’s jelly dick, but I don’t like it. I’m more impressed from a conventional deadlift than I am a much shorter ROM’d sumo, but maybe I’m a purist who doesn’t like gear (yes, raw lifters use sumo, but my guess is that sumo developed to take advantage of the gear). Pressing prior to ’72 was supposed to have locked out knees, yet everyone clearly had knee bending in the start of their press. This is more so due to the inconsistency in judging over a several year period, but the lifters were doing whatever they could to win within the rules. I guess another example is holding in football. I played linebacker and was up against the tackle or tight end a lot of the time when I rushed the quarterback. In high school, people really couldn’t block me, so they would try to hold me. Usually I did not let this happen, but occasionally it did, and it was usually blatant (arm across my chest grasping my opposite shoulder). But it was the O-lineman’s prerogative to hold their opponent to allow for a successful play or to prevent a negative play. After all, “if you ain’t holding, you ain’t trying”. I don’t know, I wouldn’t hike my trainee’s boobs up to decrease her ROM (and not just because I wouldn’t have her lower to her boobs anyway); it isn’t an actual representation of her strength, and that’s what powerlifting is supposed to test.</p>

<p>Inspiring post, proof that hard work and dedication pays off. This spoke to me, probably because I’ve been feeling fatigued the last week or so, and have been lifting like shit. I’m curious as to how Chris dealt with a “off” training session or week. My approach has to just keep lifting, but things are not improving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear mlsimmons,</p>
<p>I talked to Chris about this on the phone. He reminded me that there was a period of almost six months in 2010 (after his first meet) where his deadlift and squat did not really improve. We both attributed this to a couple of factors, listed in order of importance:</p>

<p><em>Chris had to learn how to do non-gym stuff better</em>. Chris has always loved to eat, but he had to improve the way he ate so that it was consistent throughout the day, and provided a better set of macros. It wasn’t until the last year that he really improved the quality significantly, but back then he started eating more meat and getting a higher daily protein allotment. He also made it a point to improve his sleep schedule; this is usually done by managing time throughout the day better. Over the past couple years he has learned how to take care of his body better (including resting properly and doing mobility work), and it significantly helps him recover. Back then, the two main things were diet and sleep.</p>

<p><em>The program wasn’t any good</em>. I accept the blame for the deficiency in the program, but an important point is that we were still sort of under the guidance of Rippetoe. I had been doing more experimenting on my own in programming by January of 2010, but it still took some time before I made larger, more significant developments in how we program Texas Method related stuff. I think the biggest thing that held Chris back was doing the “halting deadlifting and rack pull” alternate. It’s just something that I strongly dislike because it causes more harm than providing any benefit, not to mention there are a variety of other ways to improve pulling strength that still allow for full ROM deadlifts. The beauty of the advanced Texas Method template is that it ensures that the lifter is fresh for their heavy day every week (this is all in the second e-book).</p>

<p>When you arrive at a gym feeling shitty, it isn’t because you “just don’t have it”. There are variables that effect your readiness. It’s possible that you can’t control some of the factors (e.g. a fire fighter’s shift is filled with putting out fires), but there are many you can control (e.g. using progressive relaxation to alleviate life stress). What I mean is that you need to identify the problem-causing variables and address them <em>outside of the gym</em> to improve your training inside of it.</p>
<p>Also, take a look at your program. It’s possible that you may be doing too much to recover from. Feel free to post your template in the comments for my response. I’ve consulted with many people that didn’t realize they were doing too much volume. While it’s true that it is nearly impossible for a recreational lifter to “overtrain”, they definitely can overreach their recovery capabilities to the point that it inhibits their training. Whether it’s eating more protein every day, sleeping better, reducing your volume, or alleviating life stress, there is something that can help you train.</p>

<p>Would it be fair to say that Chris has exceptionally high genetic potential, with it being understood that it takes tremendous work to approach ones potential?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear curt1s,</p>
<p>It’s a fair question, indeed. I want to point out that one of the reasons I wrote this post is to stave off the notion that Chris is “genetically gifted”. People have said this about AC and even me in the past. I dislike that conclusion cause it makes it seem like we all accidentally got to where we are, and the difference is that we all train our fucking dicks off every single week. I’ve had people say the same about Brent, admiring his strength to body weight ratio. Well, you know what? Brent has trained an average of three times a week for at least four years. If he wasn’t at his current strength level, you wouldn’t know who he is because he would have been in a coffin years ago.</p>
<p>But seriously, we aren’t genetically special. We are “special” in that we are consistently training hard — really fucking hard. That’s the point I want to get across. You guys don’t know what “genetically gifted” means. Look at the NFL Combine; the majority of NFL players are the cream of the genetic crop. There are guys that walk into the weight room as teenagers and squat 500 the first time they touch a bar. There was a guy who lifted at a CrossFit Total Meet in WFAC several years ago who had never deadlifted before, and he pulled well over 600 pounds. <em>Those</em> are the genetic freaks. That’s what it means to have a high genetic potential. The rest of us? We’re just the regulars who have belligerently stuck around long enough to get strong.</p>
<p>I’ve been lifting weights regularly since I was about 13. That means I’ve squatted at least once a week for about 13 years (and in the last few years I’ve squatted at least two or three times a week). I’ve also played sports since I was five. AC has lifted since early high school, so he’s been doing squat, bench, and deadlift for about 10 years. Yes, I may come from good Slovakian stock (my non-training brother has a good frame and is around 195 pounds), but I’ve trained my dick off ever since I first touched a barbell. In the football off-season, I would train during weight training, and then I’d go back in the weight room after school and train again. Compare this history with someone who did not play sports growing up or have only been lifting for one or two years.</p>
<p>Concerning Chris, he didn’t lift much in high school. In fact, he swam for a portion of high school. Yet he has a very good (i.e. big) frame for lifting. He also has some medical conditions that slow his metabolism, yet seemingly help him increase muscle mass and body size. Chris’ “genetic potential” may be higher than most of us, but that shouldn’t stop you. Chris boldly said, “I want to deadlift 600 for 5.” I had my doubts, but I thought that, one day, it could be possible. And it was; last Saturday. My only regret is that I couldn’t be there to see it because I know how important it’s been to both of us.</p>
<p>The point of the article is that we aren’t special, it’s just that we’re special in how we go about doing it. And, most importantly, we’ve been doing it right and learning how to do it better over the last few years (by programming better and learning how to recover better). It’s an excellent lesson in putting your sight on something and busting your balls to get there. You are capable of doing this too, and now I hope you believe that you can.</p>

<p>What’s up Justin, my name is Bryton from Ohio. I’ve been squatting and deadlifting for about a year and a half now and started working the OL about 6 months ago following my USA OL Certification. Love the site lots of useful info. I have always looked for quality sites like yours but they really did not exist, I have learned more in the last year than all of my training history combined. I have a question about Complexes and general conditioning. Should complexes be done along with normal training? Or should they only be done when really trying to lean out? Also how many times a week should they be done for how many reps? Also how much conditioning work should be done in addition to lifting, is 2 days of hill sprints etc. in addition to lifting too much? I am trying to lean out while maintaining progress in the lifts. I appreciate any help, thanks for all the cool shit man truly inspiring. 6’3 [BW 245 BF 20% Deadlift 315 x 5 Squat 225 x 5 CJ 185 x 1 Snatch 135 x 1]</p>

<p>Bryton</p>

<p>Dear Bryton,</p>
<p>Thanks for following the site! “How much” conditioning is usually dependent on the lifting schedule and template, but generally speaking I think two days of conditioning is plenty. For example, in my “<a href="/public_html/files/Articles/Lascek_S&#038;CP_v2.0.pdf" target="_blank">S&amp;C Program</a>” template that I used for CrossFitters, they only conditioned twice a week. Everyone got stronger, the guys gained muscle mass, and their CF times were either faster or equal to what they were before. In other words, they got stronger and maintained or improved their conditioning via two days a week of conditioning.</p>
<p>In general strength training and raw powerlifting programs, I think it’s important to have some conditioning (assuming there isn’t a meet in the next month). It helps recovery between sets and improves conditioning for life. This is just an introduction to the matter, but you need to consider how the conditioning will stress the system and the muscles. An activity can be mildly stressful to the system, but extremely stressful to the musculature — especially if the trainee isn’t adapted to the movement. In contrast, there are some things a trainee can do that are pretty stressful to the system and not very stress to the musculature (a Tabata row on a rowing machine, for example).</p>
<p>For lifters, high intensity conditioning should be capped at ten to fifteen minutes. The higher the intensity, the shorter the cap. For example, walking with a sled can be extended to 15, maybe 20 minutes (including rest periods). On the other hand, sled sprints might need to be capped at ten minutes. These are just guidelines, though. But if you’re a lifter who hasn’t conditioned recently, keep this in mind: START EASY AND START SLOW. If you go knock out some hill sprints without having ran at all, then you’re either going to be so sore that you’re going to interfere with your training or you may possibly injure yourself.</p>
<p>Regarding barbell complexes, they work very well. They have been known to retain and even build muscle mass because they provide a higher repetition count with multi-joint movements (<a href="/blog/2010/08/barbell-complexes/" target="_blank">post one</a> and <a href="/blog/2011/09/barbell-complexes-2/" target="_blank">post two</a> about barbell complexes). You can throw them at the end of a strength session, or on their own day (if your template calls for conditioning on its own day).</p>
<p>I don’t like it when conditioning is done on the rest day, because it is applying a stress while the recovery processes are trying to do their job. Do not condition the day before heavy lifting, and do not use it on your rest days if the precede the next lifting session. In other words, your template shouldn’t have Lifting-Conditioning-Lifting on three consecutive days, unless you are lifting light on that second lifting day (and even if you are, I’m not a fan of three training days in a row).</p>
<p>Don’t over think conditioning. The placement is the most important part. Always do it after lifting (if done in the same session), don’t do it the day before lifting (especially a heavy session), and don’t do something stupid (i.e. don’t do too much too soon). You can ask about acceptable forms of conditioning in the comments, but most of everything is acceptable as long as it isn’t stupid. For lifters, it will usually be pulling/pushing a sled, assistance exercises done in a circuit, barbell complexes, rowing, and mixed modal stuff with calisthenics and implements.</p>

  <p>I think Brian checks his YouTube subscription for new weightlifting videos every six minutes because he dropped a video-link-deuce on the fan page this morning before I knew what was going on. Here are videos of various Russian weightlifters that are preparing for the 2012 London Olympic Games (27 July until 12 August). <a href="http://www.london2012.com/games/sport-competition-schedules/olympic-sport-competition-schedule.php?sport=Weightlifting&#038;venue=&#038;date=&#038;Search.x=40&#038;Search.y=15" target="_blank">Here is the weightlifting schedule</a> (we’ll worry more about this later), but note that Klokov is going to lift at 1700 local time on Monday, August 6th, which will be noon in the EST time zone.</p>
<p>Let’s kick it off with the whammy, a 9 minute video of Klokov preparing to lift interspersed with warming up and hitting some numbers. He misses a double at 200 on snatch, and then says “fuck iiiiiiiit” and throws 205 on. After hitting that, Chigishev gives him a golf clap and Klokov is all, “Hey brah, that’s only 5kg over the World Record, SO COOL YOUR JETS.” And Chigishev is like, “lol bro, you cray cray”. I also want to note that the building they walk into in the beginning is exactly what I pictured in the dream I had where I chatted with Klokov on a park bench (in front of the building) with KGB guards posted everywhere.</p>

</div>

<p>Now here is Klokov nonchalantly clean and jerking 232.5.</p>

</div>

<p>Here is Maxim Matveev, who is a younger Russian 105kg lifter, doing a push-press with 185kg. It may not be <a href="http://youtu.be/KtxQFmRlKaY" target="_blank">Klokov’s 225</a>, but it’s still a whole lotta weight. But <a href="http://youtu.be/mDHtCTH_ZaI" target="_blank">Matveev has jerked 250 out of the rack</a>, and that’s admirable, no?</p>

</div>

<p>Then an easy front squat followed by a power jerk…with 210kg? Thank you sir, may I have another.</p>

  <p><em>Today’s post is written by Quest Athletics lifter/coach Brooks Conway. He routinely cuts over six pounds of body weight for his meets and has developed a method based on wrestling experience, advice from fighters, and what he’s learned from a world-class coach. I’ve gotten weight-cutting advice from Brooks in the past for my lifters, and I thought you all would benefit from his advice.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cutting Weight</strong></p>
<p><em>by Brooks Conway</em></p>
<p>It’s not always necessary to cut weight. For example, if you’re doing your first meet, there’s absolutely no reason to cut weight. Go have fun; you don’t need to add any stress to the process. However, if you want to be competitive, it’s time to consider what weight class you’re going to be strongest. If you’re 170 pounds and beginning to post some pretty big numbers, it’s worth it to cut the 5 pounds rather than lift with the 181s and have mediocre results. The question always comes down to: do the benefits of cutting the weight (being the biggest in the weight class) outweight the costs (possible loss of strength and mental strain)? Consult a doctor before beginning any diet or a weight cutting program concocted by a math major.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of cutting weight is the <em>smart</em> manipulation of water. I put emphasis on the word smart because any idiot can wear a sauna suit, run around in circles for 3 hours, and sweat off 6 pounds. But the aforementioned idiot certainly won’t be able to lift to his full potential two hours later. I use a simple water loading/depleting template a buddy of mine who fights on the amateur level gave me. Six days out until three days out, drink 1.5 to 2 gallons of water. Two days out, drink 1 gallon. Day before, drink half a gallon (all of it before 4pm if you have a 7am weigh in, spread it out through the full day if you have a 2pm weigh in). One thing to consider when doing this is that drinking excessive amounts of water is liable to flush out a lot of important vitamins and minerals from your body. I typically have a Powerade Zero as 32oz of my daily water allowance to get some electrolytes in. I also take extra amounts of our <a href="http://www.quest-nutrition.com/store/scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=188" target="_blank">Ultra MEGA-4 Mineral Complex</a> because minerals are just as likely to get flushed out of your system as electrolytes. Water loading/depleting works because if your body isn’t receiving ample amounts of water, it holds on to every ounce you put in because it’s in survival mode and doesn’t know when the next time it will receive water. If your body is receiving plenty of water, it readily excretes it, knowing more is on the way. Your body doesn’t adjust very quickly though. For example, the first day of consuming 1.5-2 gallons of water you may not piss as much as you expect, but on day 6 (the day before the meet) you will continue to piss almost as much as you were the previous few days because your body thinks more water is on the way.</p>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>There’s a few other things to consider that are going to determine how much water your body is holding onto. Sodium is the most important thing to take into account. Six days out, you DO NOT want to limit your sodium. Don’t go out of your way to consume extra sodium either, but if you begin to limit your sodium for a full week, while consuming 2 gallons of water for four days of that week, bad things will happen (<em>Editor’s Note: low sodium concentrations, AKA <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001431/" target="_blank">hyponatremia</a>, means that the body’s cells swell with too much water and can cause mild symptoms like diarrhea, headaches, and fatigue, but can also cause more serious problems like heart, kidney, and brain problems</em>).</p>
<p>Beginning two days out, keep your sodium to a bare minimum. You can’t, nor would you want to, cut sodium out entirely. I would aim to consume under 500mg/day the two days before the meet. The next thing to consider is creatine consumption. I no longer take creatine monohydrate, I take our <a href="http://www.quest-nutrition.com/store/scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=44" target="_blank">Jacked Stack</a> which has Kre-Alkalyn which seems to make me hold on to a little less water weight while still giving me the strength gains (I’m not going out of my way to promote our supplements, but I legitimately do live on quest products). If you’re taking creatine monohydrate, after your last heavy squat workout, cut your dosage down to 3mg/day (under 200lbs BW) or 5mg/day(over 200lbs BW) to maintain the stores</p>
<p>in your system. On the Kre-Alkalyn I take 3-4.5mg/day while training and cut it down to 1.5mg/day while cutting. If you are a jabroni and take creatine year round, do not alter anything. Lastly, consume extra B-vitamins, as these seem to help with the excretion of water. I take Kroger brand B-complex, and typically take about 9 tablets the last two days before the meet. Also, if you drink coffee, make your first drink of the day 8oz more than you typically drink on the day before the meet. Caffeine is a natural diuretic.</p>
<p>You made weight. Congrats. The next two hours are far more important than everything you did the previous week (<em>Editor’s Note: USAPL and USAW weigh-ins begin two hours prior to the start of the lifting session</em>). The second you get off the scale, begin drinking a Pedialyte. Don’t chug it because it will probably make you sick, but also don’t sip too slowly because you only have two hours until the meet starts. Pedialyte will help to get the electrolytes back in your system. Aim to finish the bottle in fifteen minutes. Next consume the saltiest thing you can stomach. Sometimes Sherman, the owner and head coach at Quest Athletics, has me put packets of salt in my Pedialyte. Other times, I’ll have something like a sub sandwhich because of the high sodium content in the lunch meat. Don’t go crazy and eat something your body isn’t used to after dieting for a meet. After this, begin sipping on either another Pedialyte or a Gatorade. If you cut less than 4-5 pounds, do half Pedialyte and half water (Gatorade can also be used here, though it’s not as effective at Pedialyte). Consume at a little slower pace than the first pedialyte, because you’re likely to begin feeling full at this point. Assuming you’re warming up 45 minutes out (an hour and fifteen minutes after the weigh in) try to have most of the second pedialyte finished before you begin warming up. Again, after you squat, immediately eat something with a decent amount of sodium, and begin sipping on a Gatorade. Next thing to consider is your creatine. Typically, I begin to re-up my creatine stores the night before weigh-in because it won’t make me hold much water within 12 hours. With the Kre-Alkalyn, I take 6mg the night before, 6mg upon waking the day of weigh-in, then 6mg after squat. This could be overkill, but I want to make sure I’m getting as much back in my system as possible. If I were doing monohydrate, I would do 10mg the night before, 10mg morning of, and 10mg after the squat.</p>
<p>Something else to consider is your bowel movements. I think the myth that John Wayne had 40 pounds of impacted feces in his colon has been debunked at this point, but nonetheless, if you have waste waiting to be passed, that’s just dead weight. Primarily, the extra water should be enough to ensure you’re going once or twice a day. If you’re not, and especially if you’re going less than once a day, consider either a fiber supplement or a mild stool softener/laxative (emphasis on mild, no one wants to shit their singlet.. seen it happen). A pharmacist once told me miralax is the mildest. I was taking Green Vibrance before the meet and that helped keep me pretty damn regular. It’s the green powder made of barley grass, broccoli powder, spirulina, and probably the CEO’s grass clippings from the lawn of his million dollar mansion because that stuff is expensive.</p>
<p>What’s a good weight to train at or begin this water depletion at? If you have 48 hour weigh ins, you can take all of this to a much more extreme level. But with a two hour weigh in you have to be realistic. Sherman says 4%, or in extreme cases 5%, over the weight class is the most you want to train at more than a month out. For 183 thats 190-192. For 205 thats 213-215. To use this template to cut weight I would suggest being within 2.5% of the weight class, for 183 thats 187.5 (almost exactly what I weighed the day before the arnold). If you have more weight than that to cut, you need to look at your diet farther out than a week or consider moving up a weight class. Remember: the goal is to make the weight class while retaining all your strength, not just to make a weight class for the hell of it. My old roommate is a natural bodybuilder and he did my macros for 12 weeks before the Arnold becuase I was creeping up in the mid 190s after an enjoyable Christmas break. I ate within the confines of what I thought was good for my body (grass-fed beef, brown rice, steel cut oats, etc.), but he adjusted the carb/fat/protein amounts I consumed per day as my weight changed. This was extremely effective as opposed to just guessing portions, but also made me go out of my mind some days when I din’t feel like weighing a chicken breast. He offers this service at a price for anyone interested. Lastly, don’t gain a whole bunch of extra weight in the offseason just for the sake of it. I only recommend this if you are gaining weight slowly and methodically through proper nutrition, but your current weight happens to not match up with your weight class. You can bet if they had a 188 weight class, I wouldn’t cut to 181/183 just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>The more times you go through this, the better you will be able to adjust the finer details to fit your body. This is just what has worked best for me with the limited knowledge I’ve rounded up in my 3 years of powerlifting and during high school wrestling.</p>

  <p>I moved to Wichita Falls in January of 2009 and didn’t know anybody at all. I became friends with Brent when he would come into the gym and train by himself. Shortly after, I met Chris. I’ll keep the sappy stuff to a minimum, but since then he’s been one of my best friends and is a hard working, hilarious, and caring friend who has always been there for me. You guys see his videos these days and see a guy who is stronger than cat piss, but it wasn’t always so. I want to show you how far he’s come so that you understand that you’re fully capable of it too.</p>
<p>Chris deadlifts 705 at the Raw Challenge at the Arnold:</p>

<p>In early January 2009, Chris wrecked his shoulder doing a jerk in a weightlifting meet (he probably required surgery). A few weeks later he knew he wasn’t going to be able to do the Oly lifts any time soon and wanted to get as strong as possible. This is where our “training relationship” started; we became training partners and I started programming his training. If you’ve never had a true training partner, you’ll know that it’s an intimate relationship where you feed off of their energy when lifting. To this day, I still get exponentially more amped up when Chris is lifting than I ever have for my own lifting.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>At this point, Chris was squatting in the mid to high 300s for reps and was deadlifting in the low 400s for a set of five. He did not lift in high school but had been at it a couple of years. His favorite lift was and is the deadlift. We were on a linear progression together, though we couldn’t always train during the week together (I was always present during his session since I was always at the gym). Early on, I asked Chris what his goals were, and without hesitation he said, “I want to deadlift 600 for 5.” When he said that in March 2009, I looked at him, thought about where he was at (about 425×5 or so), and I said, “That would be sweet.” It was a lofty goal, but I thought one day he could do it, though it would take some time.</p>
<p>Every time Chris deadlifted, he would wear this old, hole-ridden Arkansas football shirt. He happened to wear it on every deadlift session to the point where I started joking around and saying, “Hey man, is that your deadlift shirt?” He laughed and was like, “Yeah man, I’m gonna wear it when I do 600 for 5.” And so that became his thing. He would wear this ratty-ass shirt with holes in it when deadlifting, and we made jokes that it would explode off of him as he pulled the fifth rep at 600.</p>
<p>Let’s begin our timeline.</p>
<p>July of 2009 — <a href="http://youtu.be/_whTgZnwXW0" target="_blank">Chris deadlifts 515×5</a>. This set a milestone as the heaviest weight he had ever deadlifted period, and the heaviest he had done for a set of five. Something about this video makes me laugh. Maybe it’s cause Chris looks like a kid, or maybe it’s because when he deadlifts this weight nowadays, he rips it off the floor so fast the bar flings back and forth at the top. I dunno.</p>
<p>Note that there was a two month period where Chris couldn’t squat because of a groin strain (it was somewhere in the April/May/June time frame)</p>
<p>September of 2009 — <a href="http://youtu.be/g9lj-DI7IEE" target="_blank">Chris deadlifts 600 for the first time</a>, then hitched 625. We worked his “one set of five” deadlift progression up to 545, and it was close to a limit set. I hadn’t decided what I wanted him to do on the next deadlift day, so when he walked in (with that smelly, ratty Arkansas shirt), I said, “Let’s do 600 today.” His eyes got all wide; 600 was a barrier, a giant milestone for Chris. He got pretty nervous, and he had to wait until after squatting and pressing to do it.</p>
<p>November of 2009 — Chris and I are now on the Texas Method. I’ve since started competing in Olympic weightlifting and he’s continuing to get stronger. I embedded this video because I want you to see him squat 500×3. The set isn’t very hard, but it isn’t easy. He also misses a fifth rep on a 215 press and does some haltings (which I do not recommend).</p>

</div>

<p>April of 2010 — 2010 Texas State Meet (all meets are USAPL, I’m handling him at the meet unless otherwise noted, and Chris competes raw and un-drugged). Chris squats 600 for the first time and deadlifts 633 (no video).</p>
<p>May of 2010 — <a href="http://youtu.be/FPT6tNVrhZk" target="_blank">Chris pulls a routine 600</a> without getting amped.</p>
<p>July of 2010 — <a href="http://youtu.be/KKyt5SFKA6s" target="_blank">First national raw meet</a>. He misses a third squat at 606, misses his second bench of 368 due to the lower back cramping (I waved the third), and <a href="http://youtu.be/KKyt5SFKA6s?t=2m57s" target="_blank">misses a heartbreaking 650 deadlift on the third attempt</a>.</p>
<p>September of 2010 — <a href="http://youtu.be/aVIz4yX-EnU" target="_blank">Chris deadlifts 600×3</a> in training.</p>
<p>October of 2010 — <a href="http://youtu.be/A6xs-XnrxVY" target="_blank">Chris squats 585×2 in training</a>.</p>
<p>November of 2010 — <a href="http://youtu.be/-pZB8b9mfvo" target="_blank">Chris squats 600×2</a> in training (still using Texas Method, modifying it and tweaking it as we go and developing it into what the second e-book consists of).</p>
<p>April of 2011 — Fast forward to the <a href="http://youtu.be/7GHDyhk2rOQ" target="_blank">2011 Texas State meet</a> (I wasn’t there). Chris squats 644 on his third attempt, misses a third bench at 385 (363 on second), and deadlifts 661. <a href="http://youtu.be/7GHDyhk2rOQ?t=2m19s" target="_blank">He’s also a good dancer</a>.</p>
<p>August of 2011 — 2011 Raw Nationals (no video). Chris squatted 622 on his second (missed the third), made a 374 bench on his second (missed third), and devilishly deadlifted 666 on his third.</p>
<p>November of 2011 — <a href="http://youtu.be/rDoMsDj2duk" target="_blank">Chris deadlifts 625×3</a>.</p>
<p>December of 2011 — Holiday Classic in Arlington. Chris misses third squat, but got 639 on second, benches 380, and <a href="http://youtu.be/aygYX2MA4yM?t=57s" target="_blank">deadlifts a solid 677</a> (I wasn’t at this meet, Mike/Chris used it as a training day). Later in the month he <a href="http://youtu.be/vBrrKQTEKis?t=33s" target="_blank">rack pulled 650×3</a>.</p>
<p>January of 2012 — I realize my programming fault on his squat, modify things, and <a href="http://youtu.be/CnWhlww29kI" target="_blank">Chris squats 610×2, 620×2, and 630×2</a>. He also rack pulled 675×3 and <a href="http://youtu.be/evHE2N2Qh5M" target="_blank">then 700×1</a>.</p>
<p>February of 2012 — <a href="http://youtu.be/uRHA50pJcz8" target="_blank">Chris squats 640×2 on his third double</a> (did 600/620×2 as well).</p>
<p>March of 2012 — <a href="http://youtu.be/P4RAPRC4BKM" target="_blank">USAPL Raw Challenge at the Arnold Sport Festival</a>. <a href="http://youtu.be/P4RAPRC4BKM" target="_blank">Chris squats 661</a>, close grip benches 374 (shoulder hadn’t been enjoying the regular grip), and <a href="http://youtu.be/jXlgEPzEU8g" target="_blank">deadlifts 705</a>.</p>
<p>April of 2012 — Chris aims to deadlift 600 for max reps with the minimum goal of 5 reps. Three years ago while weighing about 245 and deadlifting in the mid 400s, Chris told me he wanted to deadlift 600 for 5. Let’s see what happens:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Edit: You can view <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/criley3434/videos" target="_blank">Chris</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ghoststoglory/videos" target="_blank">Mike</a>‘s YouTube channels for additional training footage.</p>
<p>600 for 6. Three long years of ups and downs. The one constant thing in Chris’ life is that he trained hard every. single. week. The only time I can remember him missing a session is when he was sick for several weeks before the Arnold this year. Training is a priority in Chris’ life not because he thinks he has to do it, but because he loves it. I’m glad to have been a part of the journey in being his friend, training partner, and coach. Mike is also an integral part in Chris’ training, coaching, and handling (at the smaller meets) and has the same mentality with his training.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever doubted yourself or thought a goal was too lofty, then look at where Chris started. You see him deadlift 705 and think it’s a lot, but he was just an average lifter three years ago. It’s absurd to claim that he’s genetically superior, because if he was, he would have been hitting this weight three years ago. He didn’t just all of a sudden squat 661 and deadlift 705, he had to earn it every step of the way. Remember that you may have come a long way, but you still have a journey ahead of you. What are you committing to today?</p>

  <p>_Monday’s are devoted to female related topics to help females begin or continue to train. This particular post is borderline irrelevant.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>It’s not that I’m above posting about boobs (I’m not), it’s just that I routinely get questions about them. I have a stinking suspicion that the questions are from male readers disguised as women, but, alas, I am a man of the people! The most common questions I get are:</p>
<p><del datetime="2012-04-02T15:56:51+00:00">How much do you love boobs?</del></p>
<p>What if my boobs are too big for cleaning and snatching (the Olympic lifts; stay focused)?</p>
<p>What should a big-boobed woman do about her big boobs when she benches?</p>
<p>Well, my good readers, to answer these questions we will need a lesson in anatomy. Boobs, uncommonly referred to as “breasts”, are a collection of adipose tissue that lay over the pectorals. They are held to the clavicle and pectoral fascia via suspensory ligaments that extend through the mass of the boob to help maintain structural integrity. I find suspensory ligaments interesting. Normal ligaments hold bones together to form joints; their strength is dependent on their cross-sectional area, and they respond to loading by becoming stronger and stiffer. A regular ligament’s strength decreases due to immobilization and lack of stress. This is why un-fit, sedentary, and old people will injure themselves easily (especially when attempting activity that they are not adapted to). Suspensory ligaments are a very different in that one end is anchored on a bone, and the other end attaches to organ tissues, namely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper's_ligaments" target="_blank">boobs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspensory_ligament_of_penis" target="_blank">penises</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspensory_ligament_of_ovary" target="_blank">ovaries</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspensory_ligament_of_eyeball" target="_blank">eyes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspensory_ligament_of_duodenum" target="_blank">intestines</a>, and so on.</p>

<p>Suspensory ligaments of the boob are probably under stress when the boob is subjected to gravity. The modern woman often wears a bra, and this probably relieves the suspensory ligaments of tension and may help prevent the “sagging” appearance of boobs (that is, until “old age” has its effect). We can probably observe middle aged women from primitive or tribal cultures and see a distinction between their level of “boob sag”, yet I don’t think this hypothesis has been scientifically tested. I would also hypothesize that a woman who routinely exercises would maintain the integrity of their suspensory ligaments in a way that keeps them “stronger and stiffer” like their bony ligament cousins; consistent exercise probably staves off the “saggy boob effect” to some extent because of applying stress to the tissues (other than gravity).</p>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>However, we are more concerned with working around the boobs when lifting. The modern woman, especially one with above average boob size, wears some sort of supportive garment when exercising. This usually harnesses this “boob issue” to the point in which it’s a non-factor. But there may be other women that actually do have an issue with the size of their boobs, and this is probably most related to their size. No, not boob size, but the size of the gal. Consider D-cup size boobs on a woman who is 5’11” tall. Despite these boobs being large in the absolute sense, they are relatively normal looking because her frame is tall. Now consider D-cup size boobs on a woman who is 4’11”; her boobs will look extremely large, joyously massive even. Her body’s frame is much smaller, and therefore the same size boobs will appear to be extremely large. Boob size, like time, is relative.</p>
<p>I would expect females that have lifting problems due to the size of their boobs to either a) have a smaller frame with relatively large boobs or b) have extremely large boobs regardless of her frame. The former isn’t common (given that boobs typically fit the body frame), and the latter doesn’t really exist in nature. Ah, but of course, the modern woman has resources to obtain unnatural boobs (I don’t like saying “fake”, because they are most definitely <em>not</em> fake).</p>
<p>Unnatural, or artificial, boobs pose additional considerations dependent on their method of placement. There are four ways in which the implant is placed into the boob:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subglandular – The implant is placed behind the glands and in front of the pectoral muscles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subfascial – The implant is placed behind the fascia of the pectoral muscles, but in front of the pectoral muscles themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subpectoral – The implant is placed partially behind the pectoralis major muscle tissue, but the lower portion of the implant is in the subglandular area. This method “releases the inferior muscle origin” of the pec major; it severs the lower attachment sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submuscular – The implant is placed entirely behind the pectoralis major without severing the inferior muscle attachments. Instead, the lateral muscle attachment — serratus, pentoralis minor, or both — is severed and they are sutured to the pec major after the implant is inserted.</p>
</li>
</ol>

    You have no idea how hard it is to find a SFW boob training pic. Sadly, this one has a smith machine in it. Oh, and hers are probably subglandular implants.
  </p>
</div>
<p>I don’t know which of these methods “looks better” or is “more durable”, but I do know that I would not want any of my trainees getting their anterior shoulder muscles severed for the sake of implants. I do not know how the muscular severing/suturing has an effect on the performance of the muscles in lifting (e.g. real lifting, not fitness or dumbbell lifting), but I can’t imagine it being very efficient for transmitting force, especially if fibers of the serratus or pec minor are reattached to the pec minor. I did find some research comparing the function with implants that were administered subglandular (in front of the muscle) or submuscular (under the muscle) in women who exercised. Overall, women with submuscular implants had a longer recovery before returning to exercise. Some of the submuscular women also reported a decrease in function in exercises that use the pectorals and a couple reported pain. The subglandular women didn’t report any pain, and most of the women (regardless of implant placement) said they would have the implants placed in the same way again. (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19336160" target="_blank">ARTICLE LINK</a>)</p>
<p>It’s clear that women who want implants must take these varying surgical procedures into account if they care about their training. If they already have had the procedure, then their focus is probably on preventing their investment from damage. Women with large natural boobs are probably interested in not damaging theirs as well. Here are some methods.</p>
<p><em>When Benching</em></p>
<p>Most of the questions I hear about large boobs relate to the bench. In fact, one female reader (who has experienced some boob trauma while handling 36DD’s) has seen a woman at a meet use her implants to her advantage in a powerlifting meet (the implants were apparently hiked up higher by her boyfriend’s hands to give her two more inches on top of the five inches she allegedly already had). Let’s ignore the outlying “excessively large unnatural boobs” issue; that trainee will just have to work around them. Let’s focus on the women who want to train their bench through a full ROM.</p>
<p>A proper bench set up will have maximal scapular retraction (shoulder blades pinched) with thoracic extension (chest pulled up). Note that the lumbar spine does not need to be in maximal extension. Using a proper grip (one that allows for vertical elbows at the bottom ROM) and proper shoulder and elbow positioning (with <a href="/blog/2011/10/lats-while-benching/" target="_blank">external rotation for maximal muscle recruitment</a>), the bar will usually be lowered to the top or middle of the sternum. If the bar is being lowered to the boobs themselves, then the lifter is either a) lowering the bar with too much shoulder internal rotation (flaring the elbows) or b) not in enough scapular retraction and thoracic extension. The point on the chest or sternum that the bar is lowered to is dependent on body dimensions, but it will typically be the sternum instead of the pecs, boobs, or nipple line. When in doubt, lifters should take the bar to the top of the sternum as it will help them achieve proper external rotation (since the elbows will need to be at a 45 degree angle with respect to the torso in order to lower the bar to the sternum).</p>
<p>If the lifter is in a meet, then it’s probably in their best interest to abuse the rules and use their boobs to decrease the total ROM that they have to move the bar. Note that I think this is “jelly dick” behavior.</p>
<p><em>When Cleaning</em></p>
<p>No! This isn’t a discussion on the boobs should or shouldn’t be doing when a woman is cleaning the house (with help from her scantily clad man-friend, obviously)! Stay focused! I’ve never seen a woman who couldn’t clean properly due to large boob size — if the boobs <em>are</em> hit, it’s usually because the lifter did something wrong — but theoretically it could happen. My first suggestion would be to strap those babies down with two sports bras. I knew a girl in college who did this when she was going to use the elliptical or run; it’s necessary to prevent excessive movement (and probably reduces strain on those suspensory ligaments). Assuming the boob potential is harnessed with proper attire, and the lifter is routinely hitting or skimming her boobs, then her form fault should be addressed. If such a lifter doesn’t have a coach, she can link her clothed video to me (I’m being serious, this isn’t a request for racy vids, but if you are hurting your boobs, then I can help clean up the technique so that you don’t hurt your boobs — hurting boobs is like hurting puppies and I want to put a stop to it).</p>
<p>We have been on quite the journey today, indeed! We have learned some basic anatomy about boobs, inquired about the longevity of boobs, discussed boob relativity, learned about different boob implant procedures, learned how to accommodate large boobs in lifting, and allowed me to say the word boob 55 times. A joyous day indeed!</p>

  <p><strong>Recap</strong></p>
<p>I started the week by <a href="/blog/2012/03/youll-never-be-perfect/" target="_blank">trying to break the myth</a> that all lifting will be perfect all of the time. There were tips for coaches and lifters on how to prepare trainees or the self for successful lifting. Tuesday I readdressed the issue of <a href="/blog/2012/03/a-half-squat-is-not-a-squat/" target="_blank">squatting to depth</a>. I believe most of 70’s Big readers train properly, but just in case they didn’t, they know that a partial squat is not a squat. Wednesday we talked about the <strong><a href="/blog/2012/03/australia-workshop-april-1415/" target="_blank">70’s Big Workshop in Australia in April</a></strong> and I complained about <a href="/blog/2012/03/feel-the-burn/" target="_blank">lazy betties in the gym</a>. Thursday I gave some <a href="/blog/2012/03/rack-pull-tidbits/" target="_blank">pointers on the rack pull</a> to ensure that trainees get the full worth of the movement.</p>
<p><strong>PR Friday</strong> is a day where we talk about our training ups and downs. It’s a chance to keep other people on the site updated with your progress. The “regulars” all know who each other are and like to see how their internet friends are doing (“I met a cool guy on the internet”). Post your weekly PR’s, but also your training updates to the comments. You lurkers should jump on it too; we’re all friends here.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Reading List</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Last night I finished reading <a href="http://www.joeabercrombie.com/" target="_blank">Joe Abercrombie</a>‘s “Best Served Cold” and really enjoyed it. It was the first stand alone book after “The First Law Trilogy”, which is amazing, and the precursor to the recently released “The Heroes”. “Best Served Cold” introduces some new characters, but also uses some side characters from the trilogy. The pacing seems different, as if this book develops more gradual. Instead of constant diabolical activity, it’s larger in scope and the characters develop and evolve throughout the book. Trust in the fact that Abercrombie won’t bore you with a repetitive plot; the second half of the book functions differently than the beginning. I found it interesting how Abercrombie interweaves grandscale plot points into the ending of the book that will resonate outside of this particular story. Since he’s signed on to do several books in this “world”, the books stand apart from one another yet you can see how he’s developing a behind the scenes plot in addition to the one on stage. Abercrombie’s books fit into the new “gritty fantasy” genre infused with medieval and colonial realism and topped with subtle viking overtones. His characters are dynamic, and, just like in George R. R. Martin’s work, the line between good and evil is blurred. “Best Served Cold” may start as a superficial revenge story, but it ends with the characters inadvertently philosophizing to validate the decisions and changes they’ve made. “Best Served Cold” is gritty, bloody, and poignantly satisfying.</p>

<p><a href="http://robertsontrainingsystems.com/blog/you-dont-coach-exercises/" target="_blank">You Don’t Coach Exercises…</a> – I don’t know much about Mike Robertson, but I agree with his observation here. The difference between us is that I got bored from coaching one-on-one much faster than he did, and “coaching people” still isn’t enough to harness my creative interest (with respect to one-on-one training). The writing style is pretty raw (particularly the constant page breaks), but I’m not a perfect writer.

<blockquote>
<p>Are you wearing New Balance Minimus shoes in that pic? if so, how do you like them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Chris,</p>
<p>Those are New Balance Minimus Trails (MT10), and they are my favorite pair of shoes I’ve ever owned. I got them last July and they are a fantastic shoe for running and wearing casually. If you remember some of my foot posts (<a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-awareness/" target="_blank">Foot Awareness</a> and <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-drills/" target="_blank">Foot Drills</a>), you’ll know the importance of good foot structure. I no longer wear flip flops all the time because of this and instead have been wearing the MTs without socks when I go outside (granted it isn’t extremely hot outside yet). I have sprinted and ran short distances in them (&lt;2 miles) and they are very good running shoes that allow for good POSE technique. They are not good shoes for agility given the lack of stability in the upper and the lack of &ldquo;grip&rdquo; (via friction) in the sole, but they only have a 4mm heel differential and fit my foot like a glove (I have wide feet). I purchased the MX20s (cross trainers), and the sole was entirely too narrow so I sent them back (for a refund, haven&rsquo;t gotten any others). I would not like wearing the cross trainers for casual wear, but I would not wear the trails for lots of &ldquo;met-con&rdquo; work (if you&rsquo;re a CrossFitter). I will note that I&rsquo;ve done conditioning in the trails and haven&rsquo;t had a problem.</p>
<p>Some “real trail runners” complained that the soles were not secure enough to avoid sharp rocks from hurting the feet, and I can see that happening. However, New Balance just came out with the Minimus Zero series that has a 0mm differential (compared to the previous 4mm), and the trails are supposed to have a harder sole to prevent foot damage when on an actual trail. I’ve never worn the Reebok CF shoes (probably over priced) nor have I tried on Inov8 shoes, but I really like the NB stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Justin, you bring up the noncoached trainee. How would you recommend a noncoached trainee stay motivated when multiple failures/resets happen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear aramirez,</p>
<p>Your question is broad, so it’s difficult to get specific with my advice. The first thing I would say is that there’s always a reason that failures occur. Whether it’s due to mechanics, a bad program, too much frequency or volume with a given lift, poor nutrition, bad sleeping, and, the most common, poor mobility. One thing you can do is film your sets and send them here. The other you can do is learn as much as you can about programming (I routinely try and teach it here), but you can also questions on this site, Twitter, or the Facebook Fan Page. For example, if you’re on a 5×5 program, that would probably explain why you’re unable to recover. If you’re squatting 3x/week and near the end of your linear progression, you probably should look into a 2x/week squatting program (Greyskull LP helps a lot of guys that had trouble in later stage SS). You might be trying to make progress too fast, or you may be trying to do much. Who knows? But I do know there’s a reason you’re failing, and so let’s figure it out.</p>
<p>Oh, and constant resetting is not going to be conducive for progress. If you’ve reset several times and are (allegedly) recovering properly, then you probably need to stop banging your head into the same program.</p>

<p>Last year you gave me some very helpful advice for choosing my powerlifting attempts. Lisa and I are competing on April 14. I think I know what to do, but I’m not sure how to choose her attempts. I’ve read about how females tend to have a 1RM that is closer to their working weight. Since this is her first meet I just want her to go 9/9, but I also want her to lift something that she can be proud of. She’s been doing a 3×5 linear program.</p>

<p>Dear Maslow,</p>
<p>Here is a table from “The Texas Method E-book – Part 2” from the “Using the Texas Method for Powerlifting” chapter. Primarily look at the “Intensity Day” sessions at the end of the week since you guys are not using the TM (click to enlarge):</p>
<p><a href="/2012/03/beginnertaper-TexasMethodPt2.png"><img data-attachment-id="6646" data-permalink="/blog/2012/03/qa-24/beginnertaper-texasmethodpt2-small/" data-orig-file="/2012/03/beginnertaper-TexasMethodPt2-small.png" data-orig-size="450,210" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="beginnertaper-TexasMethodPt2-small" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/03/beginnertaper-TexasMethodPt2-small.png" data-large-file="/2012/03/beginnertaper-TexasMethodPt2-small.png" src="/2012/03/beginnertaper-TexasMethodPt2-small.png" alt="" title="beginnertaper-TexasMethodPt2-small" width="450" height="210" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6646" /></a></p>
<p>You can see the overall strategy. Note that two weeks out, all of those singles are starred. This is because I don’t think they should be maximal efforts, but they should be at least “second attempt efforts” (this is explained in more detail in the chapter). When you said you guys were going to deadlift maximally two weeks out, instead I would “single on up” to something that isn’t nut/ovary-busting, but something that breaches into the “maximal” arena. The squat and bench singles are there so that they lifter can perform them with the judging commands; this will be a good refresher for you, but good for Lisa given that this is her first meet. Have someone sit in a chair in front of you guys and perform the normal “squat/rack” commands, and do the same on bench. If Lisa hasn’t paused her bench yet, then this will give her some practice with it. Just like in your plan, there is no deadlift the week before. At most there could be a few speed pulls just to practice the movement, but that is only necessary if the lifter hasn’t been deadlifting full ROM reps (perhaps they were doing haltings, or something else I wouldn’t recommend).</p>
<p>As far as choosing attempts, stick with the mindset of “easy opener, moderate second attempt, match or set a PR on third”. Especially with Lisa. You want her to crush her opener. It might even be something like 150 pounds. Sure, she’s doing 175 for reps, but some are high. The point is you set her up for success early, but don’t make too big of jumps. You will probably make a 10kg jump to her second, and then a 7.5kg or 5kg jump to her third, depending on how it looks. I’d suggest aiming to hit a third of 180 or 185, so 175 on the second, and 155ish on the opener? Remember that she probably isn’t adapted to the higher intensity lifting, so be more conservative than you think you need to be.</p>
<p>If she hasn’t been paushing on bench, I would aim to get a 95 lbs meet PR. You could see how she does in the next few weeks, but 100 may be doable. With experienced guys, I know that if they can double it touch-and-go, then they can pause it (but don’t apply this to Lisa yet).</p>
<p>On deadlift, I prefer the strategy of</p>
<p>1st – last warm-up</p>
<p>2nd – intermediary jump between 1st and 3rd</p>
<p>3rd – the target weight for the meet</p>
<p>NolanPower is the first person to have drilled this idea into me. The first meet or so, we kinda did this, but he developed the idea for me. Notice that Chris opened DL at 595, then went 650, then went 705 at this last meet. The announcers commented on how much of a huge jump it was to the second attempt. Not really; he can pull 650 for multiple reps. But it was the intermediary jump to get to the 705. Had Chris done something like 640/665/700, he wouldn’t have had any gas in the tank for the third. I think this is where raw lifting differentiates itself from geared lifting; wearing gear (even though it doesn’t help as much on DL as it does on squat) may allow the lifter may be able to do multiple near max deadlifts, but raw lifting doesn’t.</p>
<p>For Lisa, I would suggest an easy opener (like 190), then 215 on her second (she’s done it for five), and then go from there. Perhaps 231? 236? (Those are the kilo jumps of 105/107.5). Either way, it’s cool that she either pulls 225 lbs or 100kg in her first meet (the same way that benching 100 lbs in her first meet is cool). They are milestones in a lifting career. The data you collect in the “singling on up” training session can help you. I wouldn’t have her pull more than 220 or 225 in that session though, and I would need to see the rep before that if I was going to clear her for 225.</p>
<p>Overall, my coaching strategy for meets is to be more conservative than not so that the lifter has more success. Remember that it’s about tacking on pounds to the total. If you go too high on a third attempt and miss it, you’re left with only your second attempt and the total is lower than if you made a smaller jump to the third. Once a lifter has done a few meets, then you can start pulling the trigger. I pulled the trigger on Chris’ 650 deadlift in 2010, and it didn’t happen. I pulled the trigger on a 666 third deadlift attempt at 2011 nationals and he got it. We programmed his training better and I pulled a big fucking trigger on the 705 this month at the Arnold, and he got it. It’s all about the lifter and coach learning together, but third attempt success can be traced back to the program itself. The point is, early in the “career”, be more conservative, especially when the lifter hasn’t been hitting maximal reps in training.</p>

<p>Dan Tara Do the same anterior forces apply to the knee during dip/drive from a push press and or jerk?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I edited it slightly for clarity</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Dan,</p>
<p>It depends; such a glorious answer! It depends if the lifter is utilizing his/her hips in the dip/drive or if they are primarily intending to use their knees. If the lifter “uses their hips”, then their knees typically go out and they also bounce off the stretch in their posterior chain. If the lifter “uses their knees”, their knees translate forward and they primary bounce off of the knees and quadriceps. I do not like the latter because it neglects musculature that I train people to get strong in and it puts a lot of anterior stress on the knee. As stated in the half squat post, achieving a full depth squat will engage the hips — even if it’s a high bar squat. But the dip/drive has a limited range of motion so mechanics will need to change if the hips are going to be used.</p>
<p>The best example I’ve seen of the hips being used is Ben Claridad’s homie, CC:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eVBb8J41rI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>She’s pretty awesome, huh? Here is an example of someone that <a href="http://youtu.be/kGJ2LOMK-tU?t=4m32s" target="_blank">shifts their knees forward</a>. I do not like the “knees forward dip/drive” because I think its mechanics are inferior in how they use the musculoskeletal anatomy; it reduces the amount of musculature used and puts unnecessary stress on the anterior knee.</p>
<p>How can it be cued so that it looks more like what CC is doing above? I’d have to see it in person, but placing the weight on the heels (“heels”) and shoving the knees out on the dip (“knees out”) can help. However, a demonstration drill is probably necessary. The hamstrings and posterior chain need to be engaged, so the hips will move back slightly, but not so much that they angle the torso forward. A trainee can practice this by standing up (without a bar), and only bending their knees to dip/drive. Then they can dip/drive with their knees <em>and</em> hips while keeping their chest up. I typically run someone through this drill and make simple corrections (difficult to do via text), and then shift them back to the bar. It’s easy to coach, yet hard to explain from afar.</p>
<p>Overall, yes, the dip/drive in a jerk or push-press can create anterior knee force. This is why a workout like Fight Gone Bad can result in sore knees (via push presses and box jumping). However, if the posterior chain (which includes the hamstrings) are utilized in the dip/drive, then it reduces the anterior knee force. Besides, if we’re going to spend time getting the posterior chain strong, then we might as well use them in the dip/drive.</p>

  <p>The rack pull is a great exercise for developing the hamstring’s ability to withstand massive amounts of tension to improve the deadlift lockout. I prefer to program them for “intermediates”, and usually those that are more experienced in that realm. Don’t get hung up on labels like “beginner”, “intermediate”, and “advanced”; I’m merely referring to someone that’s been involved with “intermediate level” programming (typically defined by a weekly stress/adaptation cycle) for at least three to six months. They can be used with less experienced trainees if they have a severe deficiency in hamstring involvement in the deadlift. This post doesn’t aim to be a comprehensive lesson in how to do rack pulls, but highlighting some key points.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Position</strong></p>
<p>Whenever I use the term “rack pull”, I’m referring to one in which the bar starts below the patella (knee cap) and at the upper part of the tibial tuberosity (the bony potrusion on the tibia that is below the patella). Other people may call these “below the knee rack pulls”. This style of rack pull is much harder to do than it’s “above the knee” counter part because it is supposed to remove the quadriceps from pushing the bar up. Instead, it’s aim is to load the hamstrings and force them to extend the hips while the lumbar erectors hold the pelvis in place. I bring your attention to this picture I drew in MS Paint to illustrate this point in a Q&amp;A in January.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/03/hamstringtension.png"><img data-attachment-id="6640" data-permalink="/blog/2012/03/rack-pull-tidbits/hamstringtension-2/" data-orig-file="/2012/03/hamstringtension.png" data-orig-size="453,374" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hamstringtension" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/03/hamstringtension.png" data-large-file="/2012/03/hamstringtension.png" src="/2012/03/hamstringtension.png" alt="" title="hamstringtension" width="453" height="374" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6640" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the lumbar will help hold the pelvis in a neutral position to allow the hamstrings to stay stretched (left side). If the lumbar fail, then the pelvis will posteriorily tilt and slackens the hamstring (right side).</p>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The “below the knee” starting position puts a much higher demand on the hamstrings and lumbar, and that’s why it’s preferable. It’s likely that the lifter won’t be able to rack pull as much as they deadlift, and it’s often much less with these mechanics. That is okay, because the point is to train hamstrings to extend the hips while under immense tension. If a deadlift lockout is void of hamstring involvement, then the lumbar spine rounds and puts unhappy stress on the vertebrae. Injury potential increases and muscular involvement decreases. A deadlifter will pull more weight if he actually had strong hamstrings and actually used them, and that’s what the deadlift will train.</p>
<p><strong>The Knee Position</strong></p>
<p>A good starting position won’t guarantee a good movement pattern. The primary thing we’re trying to avoid is the knees moving forward under the bar. This knee flexion will reduce the tension on the hamstrings (because the hamstrings cross both the knee and hip joints). It occurs because the hamstrings are unable to handle the tension, and the body shifts to remove that tension. The result is that the bar doesn’t move up, yet the torso becomes more vertical. It almost always rounds the lumbar spine because the hips have to move forward since they are attached to the other end of the femur. The result is that the lifter quad pressed the weight up with a rounded lumbar spine, and then must extend that lumbar spine to finish the lockout. It’s not a good position and significantly increases the chance for injury. Here’s an example:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBFWVm51fQQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This is just a random video I found, and this guy might be very strong, but his hamstrings weren’t adapted to handling large amounts of tension here. He actually has a good starting position (with vertical shins), but you can see his hamstrings shaking (tut-tut-tut) and then the knees shift under the bar. Re-watch it and look at his lower back; it rounds. It’s not terrible, but it’s there. Look at the picture/diagram I drew above; he’s doing what’s on the right side. This won’t be productive for improving the hamstring strength or deadlift lockout.</p>
<p>Here are two videos of Mike and Chris (rack pulls start at 2:33 and :53 respectively)</p>
<p>Mike:</p>

</div>

<p>You can’t see their shins, but they are vertical. You can note the care and precision they have in keeping their lumbar in neutral position. Had their lumbar rounded, their hamstrings would shorten and be removed of tension. Both of them do an excellent job of this, but I’m particularly proud of Mike’s diligence because his deadlift lockouts are pretty fugly (he has exceptionally long femurs, and this makes it hard to lock DL’s out; his lumbar is usually pretty round). Chris’ body type (long torso, short femurs) was made to deadlift. Both focus on keeping their hamstrings and lumbar tight. Note that both of them are rack pulling below their known 1RMs (at one point Chris rack pulled <a href="http://youtu.be/evHE2N2Qh5M?t=45s" target="_blank">700×1</a> at one point, but a little over a month later deadlifted 705).</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>If you decide to use rack pulls in your training, take care to use a vertical shin starting position and do not allow your knees to track forward underneath the bar. Remember that with this movement, knee flexion will slacken the hamstrings and reduce tension. The entire point of this exercise is to train the hamstrings to extend the hips while experiencing extremely high amounts of tension so that when they are called to do so in a deadlift lockout (say, on a third attempt), it’s not a big deal.</p>
