  <p>At the gym I attend, there’s this guy who “trains” a group of catty women. His session is comprised of him not having a plan and randomly picking things for them to do. They often include torso rotations with a wooden dowel, half lunges, and pull-up negatives accompanied by lots of chatter and exasperated expressions. It drives me fucking insane.</p>
<p>The women never stop talking before, during, or after exercising. As a general rule, if you’re talking during an exercise, then it isn’t a friggin’ exercise. No worthy physical adaptive stress is imparted during conversation.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I hate them so much. Maybe it’s because they have no respect for the sanctity of hard work? They talk about frivolous bullshit while I’m trying to press, snatch, or squat. There’s a reason I go and turn down the the volume on the TVs (that are inevitably airing Fox News) next to the squat rack when I get there; it’s not a fucking break room, it’s a gym.</p>
<p>Maybe I hate them because they are fooled by this guy whose only qualification is wearing a collared shirt and his only preparation is thumbing his butt hole before arriving. It seems like he licks his <del datetime="2012-03-28T17:41:29+00:00">finger</del> thumb, holds it to the breeze, and nonchalantly gauges the windspeed before randomly picking out a fitness destination for his clients. There’s no objective, no tact, no <em>substance</em>.</p>

<p>But they feel the burn. The women walk around in their designer workout clothes and hold their water bottles between their thumbs and first two fingers. After all, they went to the gym today. They can go home satisfied and turn on Desperate Housewives (why are they <em>so</em> desperate?) followed by calling their sister to tell her how she saw another woman with the <em>exact same</em> shirt and pants combo that caused her to go back inside and change.</p>

  <p>Oi! 70’s Big is headed back to Austraya in April to hang out with top fuckin’ blokes and conduct some workshops. The first big date is the 70’s Big Workshop Weekend on the weekend of April 14 and 15. This will consist of the Saturday Lifting Workshop (where participants receive coaching on lifting) and the Sunday Programming Workshop (where I lecture on various programming topics and teach you how to program). There will also be an opportunity to do some small group or one-on-one training. <a href="mailto:70sBigWorkshop@gmail.com" target="_blank">E-mail me here</a> to inquire.</p>

  <p>I was at the gym last night and a younger guy stepped into one of the squat racks. <em>This outta be good,</em> I thought. If someone actually does squat in a fitness gym, it’s a half squat done with a back pad. To my pleasant surprise, this guy walked out 135 and squatted it to full depth; I’d rather see light weight squatted fully than heavy weight done partially. After a few minutes, I motioned for him to take out his headphones and said, “Hey man, I just want you to know I appreciate that you squat to full depth.” After a split second of confusion, I added, “Cause nobody ever does.” He nodded in recognition and I walked away. We never talked again.</p>

<p>I hate half squats…<a href="/blog/2010/10/squat-all-of-the-way-down/" target="_blank">so fucking much</a>. <strong>Every time you don’t squat to depth, I pour a beer down the drain. And I HATE wasting beer.</strong> I just don’t understand why people think it’s okay to do partial reps of <em>anything</em>, much less in squatting. Muscular development or strength is achieved by working muscles through a full range of motion. Squatting, benching, or curling through half of the ROM only trains the musculature through that given ROM and typically subjects it to injurious forces. For example, a half squat will not utilize the adductors, hamstrings, gluteals, or external rotators and as a result place excessive stress on the anterior aspect of the knee. This is why ignorant people claim that squats are bad for the knees. And wWhy would someone want half a muscle?</p>
<p>Ego lifting is such a joke. Aside from the “let’s see how many plates I can put on the bar”, it isn’t quantifiable whatsoever. There’s no way to determine if one rep is comparable to another. It drives me insane and I can’t evedslkf;j;lasdkjfaskdlgkad;svn w089yt204389fvay xgch’jbk’fuck</p>

<p>Never, ever half squat. If you do we should all just quit lifting and start drinking mermosas while getting pedicures and facials.</p>

  <p><em>Monday’s are devoted to female related topics to help females begin or continue to train. This particular post is relevant to fellas as well.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Walter Sobchak: Donny you’re out of your element! Dude, the Chinaman is not the issue here!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dude, Wlater Sobchak, and Theodore Donald ‘Donny’ Kerabatsos display stereotypical personalities placed in an ever evolving group dynamic. The laid back Dude is faced with extraordinary circumstances that include kidnapping, severed toes, and potential death. The Vietnam veteran Wlater Sobchak aggressively confronts any and all situations based on his war experience. The introvert Donny is pushed into a submissive and passive role by Walter’s repeated domineering actions. This hilarious dynamic turns normal conversations into fantastic character dialog that still makes me laugh with every viewing of “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/" target="_blank">The Big Lewboski</a>“.</p>
<p>Personalities and group dynamics are incredibly interesting and every human integrates themselves into groups to socially survive. In the realm of coaching and training, personalities and interpersonal relations dictate the rapport and performance of coach and trainee. A good coach will read a person and adapt their individual communication style to the trainee, but also do so with a group. The coach should groom the trainee’s attitude and ego while they teach the trainee how to move properly. Despite all of this effort and skill by the coach (and usually due to the lack thereof), it’s possible to have rogue trainees that maintain their unique mentalities when lifting.</p>
<p>A common trait among women is that they aim to be perfectionists in their lifting. (Note that not all women exhibit this trait, but enough for me to experience it and two separate females — one a coach and lifter, the other a lifter — to point it out and give me their thoughts on the subject.) The female aims to achieve perfection in their mechanics and lifting skill to the point that it’s detrimental to their success or increase in weight. Knowing why this occurs can be helpful to a coach so that they can help focus the trainee on what really matters. The “perfectionist” mentality seems to be more prevalent in females, but I also see it with men, too.</p>
<p><strong>The Coach’s Fault</strong></p>
<p>I put a lot of the responsibility (and blame) on a coach since they are supposed to be the teacher, guide, and mentor to a trainee’s success. They are supposed to exhibit and implement leadership to not only result in successful lifting, but successful mindsets for lifting. When I’m coaching, I honestly feel I can coach any situation, any movement, and make it the most efficient and successful movement possible given that person’s ability. I also feel that I can communicate efficiently with them to the point that they are prepared and confident about the activity. The real “in the trenches” aspect of coaching is what occurs between sets. Sure, the cues and how they are given are important, but the interaction and discussion in between sets is more important. I feel that coaches spend too much time discussing the mechanics or technique of what just happened.</p>

</div>
<p>Having a coach means that the trainee shouldn’t have to think about what you’re doing; sometimes I tell trainees to turn their brain off because I am now their brain. If I give them one or two cues to focus on in a set, and they are also thinking about several other things, then that’s way too much shit going on and none of it will be right. Sometimes coaches will also cue other things that they didn’t focus on before the set, or even things that haven’t yet been taught, and things get complicated really quick. A trainee seeking perfection needs to stop thinking and let the coach tell them what to do.</p>
<p>However, the coach can make things complicated by getting deep into a discussion of mechanics and then not “bring it all home”, a phrase that whittles the conceptual lesson into simple, practical cues. Did you just spend 90 seconds explaining why shoving the knees out improves tightness in the squat? Then give them one or two cues to accomplish it. I even sometimes say, “Okay, that’s all the conceptual shit, but here’s what you’re doing to do: 1) track your knees over to, so “track knees”, and 2) push your butt out of the bottom, so “push butt”.” Then as they are setting up, I’ll remind them again, “Track knees; push butt”. Set the trainee’s brain up for success by simplifying their world into one or two points of emphasis. During the set, focus on these things, but if alternate cues are needed, make sure they are descriptive and simple. Only use “other cues” if the trainee is experienced.</p>
<p>Yet the coach should be prepping the person’s ego from the moment they meet. The act of doing so is entirely dependent on the individual trainee, and the coach should adapt their personality to them. Trainees can be unsure, aggressive, motivated, willing to learn, or skeptical (among other traits). If the coach gets the impression the person will be timid or unsure of their ability, then they should passively address it from the start.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna do great, lifting isn’t as hard as people make it out to be.”</p>
<p>“That’s a really good set for a beginner.”</p>
<p>“And that’s a squat. First set down and you’re already a pro. Guess you don’t need me anymore, huh?”</p>
<p>Obviously you won’t lie to the trainee, but if you’re a good coach, then they are going to squat well; the point is that you let them know they are.</p>
<p>You will also have long-term trainees that develop this attitude. They feel that since they have worked with you, they should be perfect. This is the time when you remind them where they came from.</p>
<p>“Remember when you got here you were just squatting 50 pounds? Now you’re doing 135, AND you’re tracking your knees properly.”</p>
<p>“You forget that it was a struggle to do 65 pounds, and now you’re doing 95 pounds with rock solid form.”</p>
<p>“You’ve really come a long way. A year ago you were soft and weak, and now you’re lean and strong. Sure, we’re having trouble with 200, but it’s a hell of a lot more than any of the girls you work with can do.”</p>
<p>All of these comments are things I’ve said to female trainees before. When a trainee is kicking themselves for “not being good enough”, it gives them perspective on where they are at and how much they’ve improved.</p>
<p>One of the coach’s jobs is to reduce the amount of thinking a trainee needs to do and act as their brain to improve technique. The other is to maintain a positive outlook, show perspective, and give credit when it’s due. Sometimes a trainee loses sight of all the impressive progress they have made. But what if you don’t have a coach or you aren’t a coach?</p>
<p><strong>The Trainee’s Fault</strong></p>
<p>Most trainees are the “type A” personality that actively wants to improve and get shit done. They want to do something, be good at it, and be the best at it. They lack perspective in that they think they will be excessively awesome at everything they do just because they jump into it with fervor. But things like squatting, snatching, and cleaning are simple to learn, but hard to master. If they were easy to master, then coaches wouldn’t exist and we’d have a lot more competitors (people often don’t compete because they think they aren’t good enough, an unfortunate fallacy). There aren’t many people who can easily replicate movement patterns by viewing them. And if they can, it doesn’t mean that they will be flawless. The first step to reducing the desire to be perfect is accepting that you aren’t.</p>
<p>Trainees should also avoid comparing themselves to others. It’s okay to have a role model or admire people who excel, but to constantly compare themselves to the best can result in the “I suck” mentality. In reality, you may suck, but who gives a shit? Decide to get better every training session and commit to doing it consistently. A year of determined training will result in progress.</p>
<p>Un-coached trainees should also create one or two simple cues to focus on each set. They should aim to create a triage that focuses on the big issues before worrying about little specific movement details. Most of these “big issues” can be picked up from cues that I talk about on this site or by listening to other coaches online (but keep in mind the cues may be specific to their system, or the coach may not be any good). By only focusing on one or two things, the trainee won’t have a sensory overload from trying to make everything perfect at once. It also frees up the mind to let the movement freely occur without restriction.</p>
<p>Trainees who aim to be perfect will get frustrated when they aren’t. They need to realize that failing and not doing well are apart of the growing process — that goes for life or lifting. Missing a snatch or failing a squat triple are data points that help provide information on how to get better. The “getting better” process is more difficult without a coach, yet the desire remains high to do so. Frustration is vented in different ways. Guys will typically get pissed and probably kick things (possibly breaking something). Women will typically get so fucking pissed that they tear up and want to avoid the situation altogether (“If it’s not right, what’s the fucking point?” or “I was supposed to PR and I didn’t”) Some women, including the strongest and best performers, will sit down on the platform and have a bit of a cry. It happens. Instead of saying, “Forget this,” the trainee should take an objective look at the situation.</p>
<p>Failure is an opportunity to observe what went wrong and figure out how to improve it, but failure is an irritating bitch. Take a second to vent your frustration, but then objectively analyze the situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All things considered, this isn’t a big deal. I missed a training lift? Okay, I’m not hurt. This is but one training day of many, perhaps a lifetime. Oh, wait, this was a meet and I bombed out? This is a national meet and I hit my chin and missed a jerk? Fuck iiiiiiit. At least my dick/ovaries/boobs are still attached. Worse things have happened to better people.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put it all in perspective. One time, John Welbourn told a 15 year old kid I was training, “Well, you’ve got two choices every morning. You can wake up and put the barrel of a gun in your mouth, or you can go and kick ass all day. The choice is yours.” He strode away, and after taking a breath from laughing, I told him that the kid was 15, to which he replied, “Oh shit. Hey, don’t kill yourself; I thought you were at least 18.” But the point still applies: be a quitter or figure out what you need to do to be the best you can be. The choice is yours: Glock or go.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Aiming to be perfect is a natural trait, especially in someone who is motivated to succeed. Yet lifting is easy to learn and hard to master; if everyone was perfect then coaches wouldn’t exist. The coach should aim to be the trainee’s brain and simplify their cues to improve execution. The coach should also prepare the ego and confidence for lifting, and that usually means giving credit where it’s due and giving the trainee perspective in how they have improved. Trainees need to accept that they aren’t perfect and stop comparing themselves to better lifters. The un-coached trainee should also simplify their points of emphasis, or cues, to one or two things for each set; these should always focus on the gross motor aspects of the movement instead of frivolous details. Lastly, the trainee should put everything in perspective. How far have I come from when I started? Does a lack of perfection matter in the grand scheme of things? Make a decision between “Glock or go”; quit or kick ass. Adjust the mindset and work to get better instead of worrying about deficiency.</p>

  <p>It’s <strong>PR Friday</strong>, so post your training updates and weekly PR’s to the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Question of the Weekend:</strong> What is a piece of training information you learned recently <em>outside</em> of 70sBig.com? This can be from an external source or based on personal experience.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Reading List</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Unfortunately I haven’t read many internet articles this week because I’ve started Joe Abercrombie’s Best Served Cold. I actually started reading The Heroes, but realized BSC comes first. They are stand alone novels, but there are some characters and plot points from BSC in The Heroes, and I didn’t want to read them out of order. For those of you who don’t know who Abercrombie is, he wrote the amazing “First Law Trilogy”. If you have a vague interest in diabolical plots, dynamic characters, mild fantasy, or viking and barbarian violence, then you need to read that trilogy as soon as fucking possible.</p>
<p>Here are some articles that I’ve been linked in the last week. To be honest, I haven’t read them, but I think that they will either be good, or will spark some discussion. I’ll get to them and try to post my thoughts in these comments.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A Time</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Justin,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After reading some of Rudy Nielsen and Louie Simmon’s observations on training using the Prilepin table, I’m wondering if you had any thoughts on the applicability of the table to conditioning. Would it make any sense at all to include the lower end of the table (55-65% of 1RM) into any continuous activity? For example, with a deadlift max of 500lbs, would a conditioning workout consisting of 6 continuous rounds of 4 reps of deadlift at 275lbs coupled with some other exercise (lets say pushups) make any sense, or would the lack of rest completely destroy any benefits of such a workout? I suspect it might, but does that mean that anything above 55% of 1RM is verboten for conditioning work?</p>

<p>**CONTINUE READING THE Q&amp;A</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Dear canuckian,</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever seen “verboten” used in a sentence before. Regarding your question, I do not base conditioning stress on Prilepin’s table, but I suppose it could be used as a guideline. Prilepin’s table exists to serve as a guideline for strength training. “Conditioning” is a loose term; in FIT, we define it to mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A) habituating structures to tolerate new activities,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(B) improving the cardiovascular and respiratory systems ability to supply energy to the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>working muscles in order to sustain a task over time, and (C) developing the ability of the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>muscle to take up and utilize the energy delivered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your case here, we’re specifically referring to the body’s ability to sustain work for an arbitrary time. When I program for a goal like this, it’s mutually exclusive from strength training. If I aim to condition, then I want the most efficient conditioning workout given the desired adaptation, so I’m not going to blend the two. There are some instances where the trainee only requires “light conditioning”, and this can be accomplished by performing the session’s assistance exercises in sequence (like circuit training) to get the heart rate up and create more of an endurance element. However, if the program aims to effectively condition the gained strength (whether that conditioning is very specific or general), then I will not fuse strength training into conditioning since, by definition, they are different things.</p>
<p>That being said, Prilepin’s table can give you an indication of what not to use in conditioning. Given that the maximum repetition range at 55% is 30 reps, it should tell you that if you go beyond this rep range with this percentage, you are applying too much of a stress. I will point out that these rep ranges are typically dependent on very fast bar speed to illicit a good strength training stress; by using these percentages for conditioning, the effect is entirely different. That means I would really creep into that range to begin with if strength training is the goal (since it will interfere with proper strength training recovery).</p>
<p>If your goals demand conditioning in addition to strength, then the ‘window’ is more ‘open’ on what percentages you use. If you are training for the CF Games, like most of Rudy’s trainees, then you will probably have to breach this percentage realm, albeit intelligently (he seems to do so). These are just my thoughts and what I would do given general S&amp;C trainees. Rudy may have thoughts on whether he uses the table for his purposes.</p>
<p>TL;DR — Do not fuse conditioning with strength. Condition with lighter stuff. In FIT I give parameters on repetition ranges and percentages for conditioning. Prilepin’s table can provide a guideline of “don’t go above this percent”, but keep in mind it was designed for the sole purpose of building strength (and it’s lighter percentages are best used with very high bar speed).</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was just wondering what a “respectable” press to jerk ratio would be for someone that lifts weights to supplement other sports as opposed to someone that specifically trains Olympic lifts. For example, if I can press 150, what should my jerk be, without spending years specializing in the O-lifts?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I dig the site,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rob R.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Rob R.,</p>
<p>Thanks for diggin’ the site. I really don’t have an answer to this. CrossFit folk may have an answer given that they press and jerk enough to get some data points, but my opinion is that this isn’t easily summed up in an average. The jerk is a skill movement; if you suck at it, then you won’t jerk much. I know people with pretty good presses that jerk like shit. I also know of weightlifters who don’t press very much, but jerk quite a bit (I have heard that Caleb Ward pressed around 70k when he clean and jerked 203kg — even if he pressed 90 or 100k, that’s still huge).</p>
<p>Basically I don’t think it’s something you should worry about. Instead of comparing yourself to the average, or even comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to you. Rhetorically, what is your best jerk? Why is it not higher? Does your grip or foot position suck? Your dip/drive? Your foot-work? Aim to improve those things (among others), and your jerk will improve. The same goes for your press: if you’re pressing 150 lbs, do you want it to be higher? If so, what can you do to improve it? Who gives a shit about other people, just be the best that you can be, assuming you are wanting to do so. Let me know what you figure out.</p>

<p>Dear JR,</p>
<p>Thank you for being a long-time reader. You may remember <a href="/blog/2011/04/gear/" target="_blank">this post</a> that has some info on knee sleeves. I was going to chastise you for not searching the site, but there isn’t a whole lot of knee sleeve info here (though there is in that link above).</p>
<p>Neoprene knee sleeves encapsulate the entire knee joint in neoprene in order to provide some proprioceptive tightness and reflect the body’s heat back onto itself. The proprioception just “feels better” in that it provides a little bit of compression, but mostly just makes the lifter’s knee feel a little tighter and subsequently safer. The ‘body heat’ thing increases the temperature and pliability of the superficial structures of the knee. So the patellar tendon and ligaments along with the other connective tissue is warm, pliable, and less prone to experience pain.</p>
<p>I hear you on the knee wraps thing. Knee wraps will actually add assistance to the extension of the knees (not in my definition of “raw”). Knee sleeves will not provide much assistance, if any. But they will feel better and you may find that you perform better in them. I don’t think they are critical, but they can help keep the knees feeling good when lifting frequency is high.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Justin, I don’t know if this is slightly off topic but I am 6′ tall and have obtained pretty good growth in my hamstrings and glutes due to low bar squats I was doing for about a year. I see some growth in my quads but not much. I tried doing high bar squats to get more growth in my quads but my previously injured right lateral knee flares up. I am thinking this is due to the more forward knee potition in the high bar (the sme reason I injured it in the first place before I learned how to do squats properly). So I went back to low bar and no pain. Do you think I was doing high bar wrong, or is my knee doomed forver thus no quad development?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear aramirez,</p>
<p>It’s a misconception that the high bar causes knee pain; if it did, then weightlifters everywhere would be rendered useless due to their ballistic high bar style. However, if you spend at least a year doing low bar, then you will require a progressive adaptation process to high bar or front squat techniques — <em>even when you are doing the correctly</em>. Again, even if you have good technique with high bar or front squats, and you have been doing low bar for a year or so, you will need to progress the vertical style stuff slowly to let your structures adapt. I was told at 23 or 24 years old that I wasn’t going to be able to improve the knee pain I had as I front squatted more (I had low barred for almost 2 years at this point). Bullocks. If you never do a movement, and then suddenly do it, then your structures and connective tissue won’t be adapted, plain and simple.</p>
<p>It’s possible your technique was crappy as most un-coached people have crappy technique, but it’s also possible you did too much too soon. Regardless of what your actual strategy was, if you attempted to do them again, you’ll have to do progress it slower than whatever you did before, because it didn’t work. There is hope for your quads, my friend. Just take time as you introduce high bar or front squats into your training.</p>

<p>My feet sometimes do this when I’m really pushing through a tough rep, but I never understood why. I have to squat with toes out about 30 deg., otherwise I get knee pain (but my mobility started off absolutely atrocious and is only now slowly improving).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear terrible,</p>
<p>If your feet are laterally shifting at all, including one side coming off the ground, during your squat, then that is not good. Figure out what is causing it and aim to fix it. You’ll never be as strong as you can be if you’re not stable, regardless of toe angle.</p>

  <p>Throughout 70’s Big’s history, we’ve put an emphasis on entering and training for competitions (<a href="/blog/2009/12/letter-of-intent-day/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="/blog/2010/01/the-letter-of-intent-part-deux/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/01/letter-of-intent-day-2011/" target="_blank">3</a>, etc.). Today’s world is one where a person can wiggle through life without any real confrontation, any real challenge. The biggest challenge they face may be waking up on time in the morning or where to eat for lunch. Men and women of today may never subject themselves to something that really tests their mettle.</p>
<p>Signing up for a competition — whether it’s powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting, CrossFit, strongman, highland games, judo, mountain bike racing, or whatever — forces a person into an uncomfortable situation. Not only will they be graded with a very specific standard, but they will be in direct competition with other people. Many people immediately think, “I’m not good enough to compete,” and “I’m not gonna win, why bother?” These comments usually arise because of fear; the fear of failure and the fear to put oneself in a vulnerable position. This would be enough of a reason to compete; it forces a person to confront their fear.</p>
<p>Yet competition inherently teaches many lessons; in essence it builds “character”. Character isn’t something your grandpa rambled about, but the foundation of what makes a person. Competition is comprised of victory and success, but also can be riddled with <a href="http://youtu.be/-9yHD2f64hk" target="_blank">defeat</a> and failure. It helps a person enter a realm of competitiveness, a place where people are actively trying to do better than others. It even allows situations where they can win in sloth, or lose with intensity. The competitive arena knows no bounds, and it asks the competitor: can you perform to your maximum potential today? That is why we urge you to compete; you’ll never achieve your full potential training alone.</p>
<p>Despite the benefit in most sport competitions available to us, there’s not anything that truly tests the potential of the mind. Yes, anxiety builds before hitting your opening snatch in weightlifting, but that’s very different than finding the will to continue when the body simply wants to sit down and have a nap. Enter the <a href="http://www.goruck.com/category/challenge/" target="_blank">GoRuck Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>The GoRuck Challenge was created by former Army Special Forces soldiers and is a team event that includes carrying a pack mixed with other, uh, festivities that lasts at least 10 hours and covers at least 15 miles. The cadre for the challenges consist of various SOF personnel, and the training is said to be similar to a day in Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS). It’s not exactly a “road march” in the classical sense, but partipants carry a ruck that weighs 30 to 35 pounds of bricks (not counting water or snacks). Sounds fun, eh?</p>

<p>To most civilians, it may sound insane and unnecessary. But today’s warriors not only must be able to endure physical pain and stress, but they also must endure copious amounts of mental stress (which is no doubt exacerbated by the physical stress). Completing a GoRuck Challenge isn’t merely a physical obstacle to overcome; it’s a lesson in mental toughness. And that’s why it’s good for you. No where else in your life will you subject yourself to getting wet, muddy, and tired for several hours, and then consciously decide to keep doing it for several more hours. Running marathons or sitting on a bike can’t replicate the feeling of 40 pounds straining on your back; that weight is a constant reminder that each step you take is a victory. Note that the GoRuck Challenge isn’t designed to weed people out and make them quit, but instead aims for the team to work together to complete the course. The GoRuck Challenge is a fantastic way to test your mettle.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about the GoRuck Challenge is its location; they are held in most <a href="http://goruckchallenge.com/category/events/" target="_blank">major cities in the U.S.</a> and are now creeping out internationally. The original location was Washington D.C., and the challenge took participants through downtown and past all of the U.S.’s famous monuments. The constant reminder of American sacrifice in the American Revoulution, American Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korea, and current wars is an inspiration as participants pay tribute to each monumnet. In other cities, participants will visit major landmarks or monuments during their quest through the night (most challenges start at 9:00 PM and end in the early morning).</p>
<p>A rucking challenge wouldn’t be complete without a ruck, and <a href="http://www.goruck.com/shop/" target="_blank">GoRuck specializes</a> in tested, life-time guarantee rucks. These rucks were designed by SOF personnel for SOF personnel and are being used around the world this very second. Note that these are un-framed rucks, and are more like assault packs instead of ALICE or MOLLE frames (and you can get one that is “book bag” sized for every day carry).</p>
<p><a href="http://crossfitannandale.com" target="_blank">Jeremy</a> and I are signed up for the GoRuck Challenge that starts on <a href="http://goruckchallenge.com/events/washington-dc-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Friday, June 15th at 9:00 PM</a>. I’m told that this date is special because all of the cadre are being brought in for the weekend (that’s probably both a good and bad thing for us). In any case, I encourage anyone in the region to join us that weekend as it’ll be a joyous jaunt through D.C.’s monuments followed by copious ale consumption (beer is the official GoRuck beverage). If you’re looking for a unique physical and mental challenge, then this is for you.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, then check out the <a href="http://goruckchallenge.com/" target="_blank">GoRuck Challenge</a> website. If you have questions, you can, of course, ask them here, but the folks at GoRuck are really nice and will help you out (but search their site first). They have some other cool events, like this <a href="http://goruckchallenge.com/ascent/" target="_blank">mountaineering course</a> (pre-req is to complete a standard GoRuck Challenge). Check the <a href="http://www.goruck.com/shop/" target="_blank">shop</a> to see all of their gear.</p>

  <p><a href="/blog/2012/03/hip-torque-toe-angle-and-squatting/" target="_blank">Yesterday</a> I talked about how the “toes more forward” position increases torque about the hip and how the musculoskeletal anatomy is used more efficiently when doing so. The finer points are still being cleared up, but the overall point seems logical and objective. But does that mean you should point your toes forward in your next squatting session? This video was filmed right after yesterday’s video while at the Arnold; it details some general points concerning cuing toe angle when squatting:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFzE9NolXyg" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p><strong>Should I point my toes forward?</strong></p>
<p>The answer, as always, depends on the individual. If you don’t currently have the mobility to do so, then no, you shouldn’t try to alter your toe angle. If a person with “poor” mobility — in that they don’t have the capability to achieve proper positioning with the toes angled more forward of their current toe angle — attempts to squat this way, then at best they will facilitate poor mechanics and at worst could experience an injury. The poor mechanics could simply result in the inside of the foot being lifted from the ground, thus reducing the stability and force applied at the foot. The potential injury could be due to undue torsion at the knee if the ankles, knees, hips, and everything in between don’t have acceptable mobility. The message should be clear: don’t jump into if you lack the mobility.</p>
<p>A corollary is to not cue someone to put their toes forward when they lack the necessary mobility. If you don’t know if they have the mobility, then reconsider your role or job as their coach. If you accept the consequences in the previous paragraph, then prematurely adjusting to a “forward toe angle” stance could have a range of negative consequences. Don’t blindly cue because you read something on the internet. Instead, develop your trainee so that they are able to handle the new mobility demands by improving their mobility over time. The best way to do that is to take them through pre/post mobility routines from <a href="http://mobilitywod.com" target="_blank">MobilityWOD.com</a> and give the trainee “homework” to do on their own. Use any and all of Kelly’s methods; they clearly work.</p>

<p>The contrast to the above coaching sentiment is that you shouldn’t cue excessively wide toe angles either. I see lots of videos online (and workshop attendees) who use toe angles as wide as 45 degrees. I don’t know whether they were coached to do it that way or if it was their interpretation of something they read or watched, but it’s just as wrong as being too far forward. As stated yesterday, a wide stance facilitates navicular drop (AKA dropping the foot arch), a position that results in the knee shifting medially and results in undue stress on the medial aspect of the knee — even with the knees shoved out. Excessive outward toe angles (those closer to 45 degrees) also make it hard to sit back with the hips properly in a low bar squat; this reduces tension on the hamstrings and places a lot of stress on the adductors (which would obviously result in lots of groin soreness). In the high bar, clean, or snatch, excessive outward toe angle typically results in a lot of torsion on the knee’s connective tissue (since the knees will typically track inward on the ascent) and places the majority of the stress on the medial knee extensors. This may be fine or desirable for competitive weightlifters, but not for general strength or fitness trainees. Regardless of squat technique, the excessive outward angle of the toes limits the force distribution across the thighs and usually focuses the majority of the force on a single area.</p>
<p>I still consider toe angles of 30 degrees to be wide; they will show the same deficiencies as wider toe angled squats (see previous paragraph). 30 degrees is actually the limit of what should be used — even with trainees that have terrible mobility. Note that trainees with the crappiest mobility will still be able to squat to proper depth with a low bar squat and a 30 degree toe angle (they will not be able to do so with a high bar squat). This clearly isn’t ideal; after all, we just said that they have crappy mobility. Mobility effects how safe and effective the tissues can function through their range of motion. If someone has crappy mobility, then they are not able to properly apply force safely through a full, effective ROM. By definition they are not optimal, so it’s silly to think that their squat is — especially when we have to give them a wider toe angle to account for their poor mobility. People that fit into this demographic should aggressively aim to improve their mobility as it will significantly improve their muscle recruitment in lifting. MobilityWOD users and 70’s Big readers always echo that they finally “feel” certain muscle groupings in basic lifts like the squat or deadlift after properly mobilizing the related structures. If structures are tight, sticky, or not fluid, they won’t be able to work through the full ROM properly and getting them to this point is an epiphany. Part of a coach’s job should be to develop the trainee towards “optimal mobility” by chronically improving their current mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Does this really matter?</strong></p>
<p>At this point, the answer is a resounding yes. Efficacy in applying force. Safety from injury. Tighter and more stable positioning. It all reflects back to improved performance and safety. But what if you can only improve marginally from where you are now? If you have a toe angle, say, of 22.5 degrees, and you squat with good, neutral ankles and appropriately track your knees, then altering your toe angle may only have a minimal or subtle effect. However, I’m of the opinion that training should be conducted as efficiently as possible, so the subtlety matters. If there is only an arbitrary 2% difference in mechanics due to the toe angle change, and we consider that 2% difference over 1,000 reps, then, yes, I think it matters. It could chronically train the hamstrings or quads more fully. If there’s even a small potential for improvement, avoiding the “more forward toe angle” just because you don’t think it’s going to have a significant effect is just laziness and belligerence (even Brent wouldn’t do that). Even if there was only a 50% chance that my analysis is right, though I back it up 100% with mechanics and musculoskeletal anatomy, a logical argument for keeping the toe angle wider doesn’t exist (currently, and to my knowledge).</p>
<p>Remember that the focus isn’t on a “forward toe angle”; this is why I laboriously write “more forward toe angle”. The innermost toe angle will probably be about 10 degrees from “forward”. Also note that arguments that focus on toe angles regarding athletics are irrelevant. If the toe angle used in training most optimally prepares the structures in a given movement, then it should be used regardless of angles will be used in other activities, whether they are dancing, judo, football, or soccer.</p>
<p>Note that comparing these mechanics to something like geared powerlifting is also not very relevant, especially with multi-ply. Single ply lifting is still fairly similar to raw lifting, and that’s why successful programs like <a href="http://www.quest-athletics.com/" target="_blank">Quest Athletics</a> lift with the same mechanics in or out of gear (their squat is the same thing as the low bar, but the eye gaze and grip is different — I think the grip is better, though). However, the game changes with multi-ply gear. This isn’t a discussion about loving or hating multi-ply, it’s just a fact. If you’re going to be successful in multi-ply competitions, then you damn well better use the gear as optimally as possible. These lifters now have an ergonomic aid to their joints; the squat suit extends the hips and the knee wraps extend the knees. Therefore, comparing their squat styles or toe angles to a raw, strength training squat is incompatible and completely irrelevant. It doesn’t mean they are wrong, it’s comprised of completely different mechanical demands.</p>
<p>What about weightlifting? Should weightlifters aim to have similar toe angles? Ideally yes, but weightlifting is a sport that aims to move the most weight. If the lifter has a collapsed ankle, knee, and hip position as he recovers from a max effort clean, it doesn’t matter. The judges don’t grade him based on his front squat technique. He has to do whatever it takes to squat the weight up within the established regulations. Should the model be a more forward toe position? Yes. Will it always happen or is it always practical? No. It’s the same with the low bar squat example above: if the mobility is lacking, then work with the available mobility. In the case of weightlifting, the skill might be lacking, so you work with what you have. Besides, worrying about how a lifter angles his toes on a clean or a snatch is pretty irrelevant anyway; the coach should be more concerned with more important things like gross motor positions and bar path. Toe angle in clean or snatch recovery is almost an irrelevant point of emphasis. However, we could say that their high bar or front squat strength training should or could fit within proper toe angle parameters.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR Summary</strong></p>
<p>If your mobility is poor, then you shouldn’t try to jump into what would be the “optimal” position for people with good mobility. Instead, use the best toe angle you can and always work to improve your mobility. The end result will be an improvement in force distribution throughout the relevant musculature and tighter, safer, and more effective positions. Avoid excessively wide to angles, especially those that are 30 degrees or greater. By improving your mobility, even marginally, you can and will improve how effective your squat is. This will pay dividends in your training. Review today and yesterday’s posts for support of this technique, and feel free to ask questions (even well-thought-out contradictory ones). However, comparing this squat style to various sports creates a moot point if you accept that a “more forward toe angle” is more efficient.</p>
<p><em>Edit: I originally intended to incorporate this into the above post, but all of this discussion is dependent on the lifter/trainee wearing weightlifting shoes. If they aren’t, then it’s a moot point because their mechanics will not be optimal anyway. Oh, and some of the best single ply and raw lifters in the world from Quest Athletics wear weightlifting shoes when squatting…</em></p>

  <p>Dr. Kelly Starrett of <a href="http://mobilitywod.com" target="_blank">Mobility WOD</a> has been preaching a more forward toe angle in the squat for a few years now. I respect everything Kelly has to say, but I don’t like to follow anyone blindly without reason. When Kelly talked about “improving torque” at the hip, it confused me. I asked various people to explain it, but nobody could give me an explanation that used mechanics and musculoskeletal anatomy.</p>
<p>I never got a chance to talk to Kelly about it (and haven’t attended his seminar yet, but will), but after thinking about it for a long time it makes a lot of sense. It all has to do with the distribution of force from the ground up, but the entire process is dependent on the mobility of everything from the foot to the back. The following video is a (thorough) explanation of what’s going on along with necessary visuals.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWi65pMS1Fc" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Put simply, hip torque is dependent on having good mobility. Good mobility allows the lifter to squat with a more forward toe angle, thus having optimal torque at the hip is dependent on having a more forward toe angle. When a lifter has the mobility to use a “forward toe angle” — or one that is about 10 degrees outside of “straight ahead” — and maintain proper knee and hip positioning, the distribution of their force application is more even across the posterior and anterior aspects of the thigh (regardless of squatting type). Here is another simple way of saying that: more musculature is used in a tighter way when the lifter has the mobility to use a more forward toe angle correctly. Being tighter with more musculature would result in being stronger throughout a squat.</p>
<p>The “torque” part is referring to the hip’s ability to externally rotate. Torque is a rotational force, and the external rotators rotate the femur laterally away from the mid-line of the body. When the lifter’s thigh, knee, shin, and ankle structures are able to allow the external rotators to do this, it loads the hip in a way that can be described as improving the “torque”, or rotational force at the hip itself. Torque can also increase at the knee and ankle since if the knee is tracked slightly outside of the toe angle, the tibia slightly laterally rotates with respect to the ankle. The result of greater torque from the foot to the hip is that the force distributes optimally across all of segments and joints to have a stronger and more stable position. This increases both performance and safety.</p>
<p>Specifically force is distributed more optimally to the lateral portions of the thigh. Anyone who actually has the mobility to squat with a more forward toe angle reports feeling “tighter”, especially through the proximal and lateral portion of the hamstrings, lateral portion of the quadriceps, and lateral and distal portion of the hips. It turns these areas “on” whereas with a wider toe angle these areas are more “off”. It’s not possible to show this to someone who is unable to achieve the more forward toe angle because they won’t be able to achieve proper positioning, and therefore won’t feel the difference. As someone who can do this, I can tell you that having a wider toe angle (that is anywhere from 20ish to 30ish degrees) places a greater emphasis on the adductors (inner thigh muscles), medial hamstrings, and medial quads. If you have ever been sore from low bar squats in the inner thigh region, this is part of the reason why (the adductors will still be “on” with the “toes more forward” position, it’s just that you won’t specifically be focusing on them and you’ll probably experience soreness in other areas instead).</p>
<p>It is very clear to me how torque is increased from a mechanics perspective, given that the “toes more forward” position increases the rotational force at the ankles, knees, and hips. It is also very clear to me, both from analyzing it and doing it, that the force is distributed evenly across the anterior and posterior aspects of the thighs and hips better in this forward toe position. If you have watched the above video and read this post and are still fuzzy on the issue, then post your questions to comments and we’ll improve our understanding of it.</p>

  <p>Hyper-mobility is common in a lot of females and addressing it properly is necessary to avoid injury and ensure efficacy in lifting. Today we’ll focus on hyper-mobile hips; this occurs when the female lifter is able to externally rotate beyond normal ranges of motion to the point that her knees are severely outside of her toe angle. If this occurs over time, it can result in lateral knee issues and even “snapping hip syndrome”.</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be looked at is the toe angle of the squat. If the lifter has her toes pointing out farther than 20 degrees, then she needs to bring her toe angle in to about ten degrees. Toe angle is dependent on mobility, and higher mobility lifters will benefit from a more forward knee position (more on this in tomorrow’s post). If her toe angle is 30 degrees or greater, than the angle facilitates the excessive external rotation in the hip. The first step is bring the toe angle in to about “ten degrees from forward position”.</p>
<p>This may fix the issue by increasing torque to the point that she can’t excessively externally rotate the hips (torque is explained tomorrow), but if not then it needs to directly be addressed. The lifter must be taught that her knees need to track in the same angle as her toes. This gives her a reference point for where her knees should go, especially when “knees out” has probably been drilled into her head. “Knees out” is vague in that it means “get the knees out more than where they are right now”. Having the knees out is important, but mindlessly using the cue can help produce this “over external rotation” issue that causes problems and injury. “Track the knees over the toes” is a specific, descriptive phrase that tells the lifter where to put her knees. A usable, concise cue to use after explaining the concept is “track knees”.</p>
<p>The lifter may require a few drills, un-weighted squats, or light squats to practice this refined technique. If she is unable to do it properly with heavier weight, then the weight obviously needs to be lowered. It’s not just the “skill” or “technique” that we are changing here; it’s the distribution of force and how the musculature applies that force. In other words, the musculature necessary to do this properly must be developed from chronic training. If she has been doing it wrong for a period of time, her structures will have developed within the context of an improper ROM, and now she has to develop them in a good ROM. Any serious problem with knee angle on the squat (whether the knees are too far in or out) will probably require <em>at least</em> several weeks of “treatment squatting” — lighter weight squatting that focuses on the proper mechanics so that the musculature develops with the optimal ROM.</p>
<p>The video below explains everything above while showing the various positions. It also includes two effective mobility methods that a female with tight hip external rotators and abductors should use if she is having trouble with internal rotation. Having a lack of internal rotation is only natural if the external rotators are excessively tight due to pulling the femurs out beyond the toe angle. Tight internal rotators would have a negative effect on split positions in Olympic weightlifting as well as general athleticism and agility.</p>

Ideally I would obviously like to continue making strength/power gains while bolstering endurance and I know at some point something will give.

<p>**CONTINUE READING THE Q&amp;A</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Dear Scott,</p>
<p>Like I told you on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a>, over the last couple of years I have had a vested interest in training military and related personnel. I’ve worked with or trained Special Operations personnel from every branch of the American military (some more than others) including SOF personnel in two other countries and have worked with various airmen, soldiers, and Marines that worked in a variety of jobs. I also told you that I’m going to be doing a Go Ruck Challenge in June in Washington D.C. (where they originated) with my friend Jeremy of <a href="http://www.crossfitannandale.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Annandale</a> (Shawn says he’s gonna do it too, so we’ll see…).</p>
<p>I specifically have a few friends that are current or prior Airborne infantrymen in the Army. For anyone who doesn’t know, they regularly have to do a 12 mile road march in under 3 hours with 35 pounds, not counting food, water, and the rest of their kit (usually a rubber ducky M4, their full kit including kevlar vest, helmet, possible weapon magazines, etc.). The standard weight easily reaches 45 pounds of weight, and probably is 50 or more, especially if it’s wet. I’ve heard of guys doing this as fast as 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is really fucking crazy). But let’s talk about how you’re going to train for it.</p>
<p>The most important thing about adapting to road marching is progressing slowly and getting “time under ruck”. You wouldn’t want to randomly throw 50 pounds on your back and set off because your feet will probably blister and your structures won’t be able to handle it (feet, shins, knees, hips, back, shoulders, etc.). Make sure you have good foot wear. Standard desert issue boots from the Army are fine, but any hiking boot will do. Jeremy has completed one Go Ruck Challenge and he wore Merrel trail/hiking boots. On your first training day, just load a pack or book bag with about 25 to 30 pounds and walk at an easy pace for at least 30 minutes but no more than 60. Be cognizant of potential blisters on your feet; if needed, stop and check out your feet to make sure you haven’t developed one. It’s okay to stop if one develops — the GR Challenge is not today. Road marching foot care is a lengthy topic, so we’ll save it for another time.</p>
<p>If you didn’t complete one hour with your starting weight, then increase your time by about 15 minutes each session until you do. Once you are on the move for an hour, the next session you can start increasing your weight. To be safe, increase by five pounds. Maintain an hour-long walk until your pack is up to 45 or 50 (if you were doing military prep, I’d say 50, depending on your body weight). Once you get a at least several sessions with the heavier weight for an hour, start alternating sessions where you drop the weight back down to about 30 pounds and increase the distance by 30 minutes. To clarify, once you have adapted to carrying the heavy weight for one hour, you will start doing 90 minute walks with lighter weight. <strong>When you increase duration, make sure to initially decrease the weight and work the weight up over several sessions.</strong></p>
<p>Since the go ruck is with about 30 pounds of bricks (not counting food/water), I’d have you stay at 30 pounds and increase duration every couple weeks. Military personnel will regularly hit 6, 8, 10, or 12+ mile marches in training. For the sake of doing a Go Ruck, just focus on the duration and <em>over time</em> work up to around three hours. This whole progression should take at least three months.</p>
<p>If your Go Ruck Challenge is sooner than later, then just work with 25 to 30 pounds and increase duration. The Go Ruck Challenge is what is called a “gut check”; there’s no solid way you can train for a gut check because it’s designed to test your limit. It’s supposed to be hard and there’s no way you can prepare yourself to the point that you’ll breeze through it. But you should definitely train for it so that you don’t subject your feet to blisters and your joints and muscles to strains or pulls.</p>
<p>Now, how do we incorporate this into a strength training program? I like a HVY-MED-LT set up for this (and use this template for many general strength and S&amp;C programs — more on this in the future). If the HVY-MED-LT set up fell on MWF, then you could road march on Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Saturdays. Your goal should be at least two road marches a week, and there should always be one on Saturday morning since you’ll have the rest of the weekend to recover. Your longest efforts will also go on Saturday for the same reasons. Cap your week-day road marches at an hour, but aim to go faster (in contrast, the Saturday movements will focus on increasing the total duration). I suggest doing the week-day road march on Thursday in a HVY-MED-LT set up since Friday’s training day is just a light session (that probably only includes conditioning, light strength movements, or isolation work). If you’re on another template, consider modifying it or logically place the rucking in (remember, one road march on a week-day and one on Saturday).</p>
<p>It’s easy to drop this stuff into a template, but it’s hard to actually do it. Don’t get a big ego and load your pack up heavy (and never go above 50 pounds). Progress everything slowly; you don’t want to have a minor tendon strain interfere with your squatting. If you’re moving in hot climates for long durations, stay hydrated. High speed socks and boots will help, but aren’t necessary. Powder your feet. Take care of the structures. And for gods’ sake, if you show up to the challenge, don’t fucking quit.</p>

<p>I saw someone else post a question a long time ago about long forearms and trouble getting into a good rack position for cleans and front squats. I have a similar problem. When I put my arms into a good elbows up rack position, my knuckles are resting on my shoulders up almost past my delts. My shoulder ROM is actually fairly decent (I do a lot of MWOD stuff for it), so I’m not really sure what to do. Right now I simply don’t clean (I snatch) and I do the crossed-arm thing for front squats, but for weights over about 275 that hurts like hell. Does anyone have a suggestion on what, if anything, I can do to get a decent rack position?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Dave,</p>
<p>Hope you’ve been doing well. People with long forearms will require a wider grip in the clean and front squat rack. It’s not uncommon to have the pinky finger within an inch of the outer ring (on an IPF regulation bar, but it may be necessary on an IWF bar). The key isn’t only to have the elbows up, but to bring them “in” towards each other. By bringing the elbows in, the shoulders externally rotate. External rotation of the shoulder promotes good thoracic positioning by putting the shoulder joint back and down. The opposite internal rotation would bring the shoulder forward and inward, which wouldn’t be conducive to having a good “chest up” position when front squatting or recovering from a clean. Also, the “elbows in” position facilitates a better rack compared to having the elbows pointed straight forward or slightly out.</p>
<p>Other extremely common mistakes are that lifters try to keep their fingers wrapped around the bar as they are in the front squat position. Instead, let the bar sit loosely in the fingers, and it’s okay to pull the pinky and ring fingers off of the bar to achieve a better position. If the upper arm (the humerus) isn’t parallel with the floor, then it’s wrong.</p>
<p>It’s likely that lacking mobility prevents a good front rack position. In which case, <a href="http://youtu.be/ig7carXZNuc" target="_blank">use tack and stretch on the distal triceps</a> (with a bar or lacrosse ball), use <a href="http://youtu.be/eveYJP1indI" target="_blank">5 way shoulder</a> (particularly the “external rotation while in flexion” stretch that hits the lat), and any other mob that improves external rotation.</p>

<p>Dear enlightenedsnipe,</p>
<p>I hope you are also doing well. Your video is pretty bad, and it’s probably a bit worse than normal given that it’s a limit rep. However, it’s something that needs addressed if you are going to get stronger and if you are going to prevent injury.</p>
<p>Strength training with compound movements isn’t solely based on mechanics; the musculoskeletal anatomy must do its job in order to achieve good mechanics. Biological structures don’t simply “get better” because we cue them, they get better because they adapt to a specific stress within a given ROM in a respective movement. In other words, improving your ability to keep your knees out is dependent on the chronic application of a proper mechanical stress. You have to train and develop the muscles to lift properly, because you’ve allowed them to develop improperly.</p>
<p>This is done in three ways: a) using loads with the primary movement so that proper mechanics are achieved, b)improve mobility to allow the structures to function in the desired ROM, and c) possibly use ancillary exercises to develop the weak structures. Right away you need to stop squatting shitty. Use only loads in which you can track your knees with your toes. If you cannot do this with a given load, then drop. Yes you will be using lighter loads than you think you should. Yes you will feel like a bitch. I’d rather see you squat bitch weight properly than blow out a meniscus or lumbar disc squatting heavy weight like shit. I would even venture to say that for a minimum of two months, this should be your method of squatting (while squatting twice a week). It will be likely that you will fatigue in the middle of a set; the first few reps may look good while the last two reps will look and feel shitty. If this is the case, then just use more sets of triples. You should aim to get 15 to 25 reps at your “work set” weight. This weight will be lower than you would like, but I predict you’ll have difficulty in doing it properly. If you have to use exceptionally light weights in order to keep your knees tracked with your toes, then focus on having fast bar speed out of the bottom; the effect will be similar to speed or dynamic effort squatting. Only do these things if, and only if, you can keep your knees tracked with your toes.</p>
<p>Work on your mobility twice a day. If you are a chump about this, then decrease it to once a day on the weekends. You should be hitting the anterior hip, internal rotators, external rotators, 10 minute squat test, ankles, lumbar, thoracic spine, etc. If you don’t mob, then you don’t care.</p>
<p>I’m not really concerned about assistance exercises given that you have a lot of work to do. Some options off the top of my head are:</p>
<p>– front squat with knees tracked for back off sets if your regular squats are particularly light</p>
<p>– RDLs</p>
<p>– Good mornings</p>
<p>– weighted walking lunges while holding DBs (where you drive your heel through the floor on the ascent)</p>
<p>Realistically I don’t think lunges are necessary. Don’t get cute. Work on the fundamentals. Get to work and update me on your progress.</p>

<p>I dont know if its Q&amp;A friday worthy, but do you have any suggestions on a program that incorporates the 3 big lifts along with Oly lifting? I train 4 times a week and just add the lifts in whenever I have time but I feel like I need more structure to actually progress the lifts.</p>

<p>Dear Eli,</p>
<p>I do. <a href="/blog/2009/12/merry-christmas/" target="_blank">This was the original template</a> I was playing around with back in 2009 in my training. There are some updates I would make to it now (and I intend to release a .pdf eventually), but it’s mostly the same.</p>
<p>Monday — LT or MED Snatch, HVY Clean and Jerk</p>
<p>Tuesday — Squat, Press, RDLs</p>
<p>Wednesday — OFF</p>
<p>Thursday — HVY Snatch, LT or MED Clean and Jerk</p>
<p>Friday — Squat, Press, DL or heavy pull, Weighted pull-ups or chin-ups</p>
<p>I’m not a huge fan of heavy deadlifting in an Oly program, so this is more “novice focused” template. The light or medium Oly work can be timed (snatching on the minute, CJing on 90 seconds to two minutes) and staying at the same weight (perhaps about 75 to 80% of max, or hypothetical max) for about ten singles with the intent of not missing. For someone wanting to focus on Oly stuff, it would kind of depend on their strength and establishes musculature, but I’d prefer to have a 3x/week template that has SN/CJ each day, with fluctuating intensities (so it’s not maximal every day). I’d drop in squatting, pressing, or posterior chain work relative to the lifter (squatting would always be there).</p>
<p>If someone just wanted to work the lifts along with their strength or S&amp;C program, they could throw in one of the lifts at the beginning of their training session.</p>
<p>Remember the priority continuum of:</p>
<p>Explosive lifts &gt; Strength Lifts &gt; Compound assistance &gt; Isolation assistance</p>
<p>If you aim to compete in weightlifting, I suggest focusing on an Oly-centric template for 4 to 8 weeks. If you end up not enjoying it, it’s easy to shift your training focus after.</p>

<p>Hey Justin how high is the effective heel in the VS shoes, over an inch for sure? I have fucking atrocious ankle flexibility that is killing my squat technique, even with a 0.75″ heel. I’m losing extension for depth because of the chain reaction of bullshit stemming from the ankles. My squats are fucking beautiful if I’m wearing my heeled shoes AND elevating my heels on 3/4″ rubber but that is gay. Not sure what to do while I work on improving my mobility.</p>

<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>First, I hope your ego is intact from the lashing Marotta gave you in the Fan Page thread about this. Second, I apologize it took this long to answer; there wasn’t a Q&amp;A last week due to posts about the Arnold. Third, you have the shittiest ankle mobility of anyone ever.</p>
<p>First thing you need to do is to mob them daily with anterior and posterior band distraction. I can’t find the video I wanted to show you, but I have two examples of the technique: <a href="http://youtu.be/hkepajNHiDw" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/lOSvwy5jN-M" target="_blank">two</a>. Both of these videos include a “super friend”, but having help from someone isn’t necessary. By the way, for everyone else, this is the specific ankle work that can reduce the tension on the knee and even alleviate posterior (rear) knee pain. Adam, regardless of the band distraction (anterior or posterior), think about getting as much dorsiflexion as possible (pushing shin to toes). Aside from that, work on getting the shin ankle lateral with respect to the ankle (the same that occurs when the knees are shoved out). If the inside of your foot lifts up while you are trying to push the shin laterally, then hold your foot or shoe down with your other hand and go to the end ROM your ankle allows. Spend at LEAST one minute on each direction for each ankle EVERY DAY.</p>
<p>You should be able to low bar squat with limited ankle flexibility (since low bar positioning doesn’t require much dorsi flexion). Also note that your lumbar flexibility is non-existent. You, specifically, need to work on your anterior hip (banded anterior distraction to start, couch stretch to finish), lateral hip (roll slowly on lacrosse ball for 2 minutes each side prior to squatting), as well as your lumbar and thoracic spine (thoracic spine can be hit decently with “5 way shoulder” and double lacrosse ball while supine). Stop using the extra rubber to squat. Hit these mobs before squatting. Test/re-test. Do it daily. Update me on your progress.</p>
