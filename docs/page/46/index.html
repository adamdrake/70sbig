  <p>If you’re wondering why there wasn’t a post yesterday, it’s because my ISP took a shit. Today, I had to use internet at a public location. I had a nice “Toe Angle when Squatting” post lined up, but the upload speed for the accompanying video is abysmal. Instead, here are some videos to wet your whistle.</p>
<p><strong>Ask questions for tomorrow’s Q&amp;A in today’s comments.</strong> I’ll gather up the good ones and use them tomorrow. Also, feel free to post interesting articles for me and other readers (if they are solid, I’ll add them to the weekly reading list).</p>
<p>Oh! I nearly forgot. Klokov was in my dream last night. We sat on a bench in Soviet Russia and had a conversation.. He was wearing a tank top. He talked about life and training. I came.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Here’s Norik Vardanian cleaning, then front squatting, then jerking 210kg (no big deal):</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXBN6otN7lA" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Here’s another of him hitting a <a href="http://youtu.be/zon7CBQY1Ck" target="_blank">really solid snatch at 170kg</a>. He also <a href="http://youtu.be/7e6Ld5YrCDk" target="_blank">CJ’d 215</a>. Norik used to lift for USA Weightlifting but <a href="http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/18425/Suspension_N_Vardanian_090929.pdf" target="_blank">tested positive for marijuana</a>. He now lifts for Armenia and is a 94kg lifter.</p>
<p>Here’s Konstantinovs doing his max effort squatting day:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>His recent “<a href="http://youtu.be/sUEVZrYeWco" target="_blank">deadlift training day</a>” vid is even more impressive.</p>
<p>And lastly, here’s Hysen Pulaku CJing 200kg at a 77kg body weight. He’s an Albanian lifter who is rumored to get US citizenship…</p>

  <p>Shawn and I attended the finals of the Arnold Classic at the Arnold Sport Festival. We had sorta followed bodybuilding a few years ago and there’s still a few guys that Shawn is a fan of (like Kai Greene), but when we sat down, we both had that, “I immediately regret this decision,” feeling. It was mostly because we were subjected to at least 45 minutes of dudes posing (badly) to (shitty) music. I don’t know what bothered me more, the fact that Branch Warren won best poser with music choices of Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock, or that everyone was whistling, hooting, and hollering during the abortion of a performance. Seriously, what happened to the grace and artful posing I saw in <em>Pumping Iron</em>? The bottom line is that Shawn and I weren’t aroused by this type of stuff.</p>
<p>The culture of today’s bodybuilding is where the disconnect is. When I look at Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding, it just seems different than today’s bodybuilding. Yes, guys were still training to improve their physique, but the drugs resulted in a more streamlined look. They had good shape, and even the bigger guys weren’t uncomfortably bulky; the size seemed to fit each man’s frame. But the issue isn’t that the physiques are significantly different (as a result of the drug improvements), but instead the difference is the culture surrounding it. Remember the scene in <em>Pumping Iron</em> when Arnold visited a prison and did a posing routine? The thugs and gang bangers had an honest appreciation for the beauty of the human body. It seemed like the world was more impressed with bodybuilding and strength sports back then. There were <a href="http://youtu.be/J6JmRzEAlQE" target="_blank">powerlifting broadcasts</a> hosted by Bryant Gumbel in the ’70s and routine public appearances by bodybuilders. It seems like it was all so new to society that there was still that “go see the strongman at the circus” aura behind it. It’s only natural since the preceding century saw the Civil War, World War I, and World War II; society didn’t have the luxury to bodybuild and it was fascinating because it was different.</p>
<p>Yet, today’s culture has gone through a metamorphosis that makes it…weird. The majority of attendees at the Arnold Classic finals were wearing designer clothes, plucked their eyebrows, and applied fake tanning solution — and I’m not even talking about the girls. This crowd also trains to only improve their physique, but there’s also that “we’re going clubbing” feel to it. It seems that if you integrate yourself into today’s bodybuilding culture by working out or competing, you inherently implement the “peacock” mentality of spreading your wings. “Look and be flashy” is not only standard ops, but what it’s all about.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t matter <em>why</em> this is the case, because it doesn’t matter. What matters is that there is a culture that not only prides itself on how good it looks, but on how flashy and shiny they can appear to others in the same group. Ultimately, that’s just weird to me. Sure, I want to be attractive, masculine, and muscular, but to me these traits (at least the latter two) are dependent on ability, performance, and health. Be strong and look strong. I’m not saying that the inherent level of narcissism in today’s bodybuilding is wrong, I’m just saying that it’s different and not my kind of thing.</p>
<p>We’re very accustomed to the “me” generation. Social media like Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter give people the impression that other people give a shit what they have to say. Posting pictures of yourself and how you look is not only standard ops, but expected. Perhaps it’s a result of a generation of bad parenting and society catering towards kids. Unfortunately, marketing to kids is a good idea because parents are able to spend money for their children. We see entire television networks and restaurant menus devoted to kids. Instead of getting told what to do, as they should be, kids get a choice about everything. They are given the impression that someone gives a shit about their opinion. This fills them with a sense of self-importance at an age when they shouldn’t be heard at all (especially in airports, restaurants, stores, or any other public place ever). Once they reach adolescence, they continue to spit their self-important thoughts and image to their peers, and this kind of behavior flows naturally into the bodybuilding culture.</p>
<p>Seeing bodybuilding online is different than seeing it in person. Since we’re subjected to people posting pictures of their clothes or body, it’s not abnormal to see that on bodybuilding forums. Yet when you’re in a building with several thousand people who are trying so hard to be noticed, it’s almost overwhelming. Shawn and I stood in the lobby as the crowds flowed out of the auditorium after the show. There were scarves, v-necks, and overwhelming stenches of cologne. I was unshaven in jeans, boots, and flannel, and I couldn’t have wanted to be further from that crowd (perhaps on the side of a mountain next to a river chopping firewood). It’s not that I thought everyone was wrong, it’s that I just know I’ll never fucking understand it.</p>

  <p><em>Monday’s are devoted to female related topics to help females begin or continue to train. This particular post is relevant to fellas as well.</em></p>
<p><a href="/2012/03/stern.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6547" data-permalink="/blog/2012/03/hahd-werk/stern/" data-orig-file="/2012/03/stern.jpg" data-orig-size="450,351" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="stern" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/03/stern.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/03/stern.jpg" src="/2012/03/stern.jpg" alt="" title="stern" width="450" height="351" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6547" /></a></p>
<p>I like Erin Stern. She’s not weird and trains hard with sprints, plyos, squats, and (sorta) does Olympic lifting. The “being athletic” part makes me like her over regular figure competitors, but she’s also positive and likes to inspire other people. Lastly, she eats pretty much the same in her “off-season” as her “in-season”; her fitness is a way of life instead of something she cycles.</p>
<p>She posted the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3042219969204&#038;set=p.3042219969204&#038;type=1" target="_blank">above picture</a> on her Facebook page, and it had received a lot of responses. It’s obvious that she’s not out shape in the picture on the left, but there is a significant difference in her development between the two pictures. Erin’s caption was, “If you want something badly enough… you will push through every rep, each set, the tears, and the sweat! Through patience and perseverance, you can achieve anything :)”</p>
<p>Kinda corny, but Erin’s goal was and is to be win the biggest figure competitions in the world. 8 years separates the two pictures above. 8 years of training hard four to six times a week and making consistently good decisions in her diet. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s goal was to become the best bodybuilder in the world. Then the greatest bodybuilder in history. A successful businessman. A Hollywood star. A politician. Successful people aim their goals high and bust their ass to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>I looked at the comments on Erin’s photo, and some of them irritated the shit out of me.</p>
<p>“ya, like we’ll ever look like that”</p>
<p>“so how do u stay so lean now without gaining all that back with one cheat meal… do u eat “diet food” all the time?”</p>
<p>“Ordinary” people think that extra-ordinary feats are out of their reach. There were also other comments from people who were fawning at Stern’s feet, expressing how AMAZING it was that she could accomplish this change and how MOTIVATING she was. The former group doesn’t think that they can do it all and the latter didn’t think they could until they saw someone else do it. I have a secret for you: successful people never feel either of those things. In actuality, successful people don’t have a set of skills that are different than you or “ordinary” people. Instead, they have an extra-ordinary desire to “get after it”. They look at the pinnacle, or beyond, and say, “That is where I want to go, and I won’t rest until I’m there.” They will fight, bite, and scratch their way to get there. They will push harder and farther, they will bloody themselves nearly to death, but they will never second guess themselves. They know only one thing: they should go forward and never look back.</p>
<p>It pisses me off when someone looks at a picture of Erin Stern or a video of Chris <a href="http://youtu.be/jXlgEPzEU8g" target="_blank">deadlifting 705</a> and voice how they think that the performer just “has something” that they don’t. They see the end product and compare themselves to it. What they don’t realize it that there are hundreds, thousands of hours of sweat, grit, and pain to get to that point. What they don’t realize is that the person they compare themselves is not any different than them. It’s just that the successful person made a decision a long time ago to be the best that they could possibly be.</p>
<p>I can also tell you that a successful person is never satisfied. Do you think Erin Stern is okay with not winning the figure competition at the Arnold this year? Do you think Klokov is content with the fact that he hasn’t won an Olympic gold medal? Do you think that Arnold thinks he has peaked? Some in the Army consider Ranger School as the pinnacle of success, but I know guys who get their tab pinned on and then quietly walk away as they think, “<a href="/blog/2011/04/better/" target="_blank">What’s next</a>?” Chris didn’t go home and think about how he’ll deadlift 705 for the rest of his life. No, each person craves the next challenge and busts their fucking ass to get there.</p>
<p>Someone recently commented on the site and said something like, “Some of us aren’t trying to be mega jacked and just want to get good, healthy workouts in.” I responded respectfully, but I honestly don’t understand that statement. You don’t want to be as strong or jacked as you can be? What does that even MEAN? It’s totally fair if someone’s family and work are the focus in their goals of success, but you’re never going to have any meaningful progress and success if you don’t step into a gym and aim to <a href="/blog/2012/03/crush-your-enemies/" target="_blank">crush your god damn enemies</a>.</p>
<p>Male or female, weak or strong, make a fucking decision to be great and never, ever look back.</p>

  <p>I’ve known of Jeff Martone (owner of <a href="http://tacticalathlete.com/index.php" target="_blank">Tactical Athlete</a>) since I got into CrossFit in early 2008, but I had never met him. After Shankle lifted in the 105 session on Saturday morning, Martone was sitting at his booth by himself and Jeremy and I decided to try the 90 pound pull-up (for a free t-shirt). I, of course, missed it:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQm5Y6GS_CQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Then I asked Jeff he was going to do any kettlebell juggling, but he only had 90 pound kettlebells (a bit heavy for KB juggling). Then I asked if he was going to do any Turkish Get-ups, and he said he needed a female that weighed 135 or less.</p>
<p>Mission: Find female who was 135 or less.</p>
<p>I went up to an over-cooked-tan blonde girl, and said, “Hi. I realize this isn’t a question a guy would typically ask a girl, but how much do you weigh?” I didn’t get slapped because I’m a little more suave than that, but she was 155. Then I saw a little gal walking with her husband. I politely asked the husband, and after hearing the question he chuckled and said, “Ask her,” while pointing to his wife. Well, we already know that that MISSION WAS ACCOMPLISHED, and here’s the vid (she weighed 110 pounds):</p>

<p>Jeff Martone has tons of experience in a variety of things including kettlebell training, martial arts, SWAT, self defense, and more. Read his accolades <a href="http://tacticalathlete.com/staff.php" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.powerathletesmag.com/pages/martone.htm" target="_blank">here’s an interview</a> with Jeff Martone by Tyler Haas.</p>

  <p>I first saw Preston at the 2010 Texas State and he’s…grown a bit. Now he’s 19 years old and kicking ass in USA Powerlifting. He’s a 120kg/264 lb lifter who competes in single-ply gear and has recently squatted 821 and deadlifted 650 at Junior Worlds. His raw bench is about 550. He ended up benching 300kg/661 at the bench only meet on Sunday and missed a second attempt 312.5/688.94.</p>
<p>Preston is friggin’ stout, and he’s a really nice guy. Again, there are a lot of good people in powerlifting. Keep training hard, Preston, and good luck.</p>

  <p>Sorry folks, there’s not Q&amp;A. I’ll also save my reading list for next week. There are still more posts that will be trickling out today from the Arnold including an interview with the young Preston Turner, the Arnold Strongman Classic Finals, the bodybuilding finals, some clips of Arnold, clips of me dicking around with one of the booths, random expo footage, Jeff Martone, and Mark Bell (probably put Bell’s up next week).</p>

  <p>I know you guys really wanted me to harass people, but most of everyone I met was really nice (even the fitness models –&gt; more on that in another post). This was some giant eastern European or Russian guy who was competing in the amateur strongman competition on Friday morning. I can’t remember his name and can’t hear it well in the video, but he was a big dude.</p>

  <p>Some people haven’t seen a warm-up room at a meet, much less one at a national or international level meet. Here are some videos we recorded on Friday morning before the fellas lifted in the powerlifting meet.</p>
<p>Here is the powerlifting warm-up room:</p>

<p>I met Chris when I moved to Texas in January of 2009. A few weeks earlier he had severely injured his shoulder in a weightlifting meet when attempting a jerk. He probably should have had surgery, and it was never properly diagnosed. Over the months we became friends, I rehabbed him back from his shoulder injury (starting with a 15 pound bar), and we became training partners. Chris weighed about 245 to 250, was squatting in the low 400s, deadlifting in the mid 400s, and literally was pressing and benching zero pounds due to the shoulder injury. There was even a three month period in 2009 where he couldn’t squat due to a hip injury.</p>
<p>I say all of this because he’s come a long way. People may look at him and just say, “Dude is a beast, a freak!” He had a nice base of strength, but he was pretty far off from a 600 squat or a 700 deadlift. He told me his goal was to deadlift 600×5, a hefty goal at the time for a guy pulling 445×5. Chris has trained hard every week of his life since I met him and has made consistent progress. To me, Chris embodies the 70’s Big attitude. It’s not that my other friends don’t have this attitude (they do) or that they haven’t made progress (they have), it’s just that Chris has been my closest friend during his journey in strength training and I’m proud as shit to be friends with him (the same goes for Mike, Alex, and Brent). One time his dad asked him, “What drives you to in powerlifting?” Chris said, “I just love it.” Remember that line.</p>

<p>All right, enough sappy shit, let’s talk about the lifting.</p>
<p>Chris has been going through some major personal stuff that would normally knock someone completely out of a meet, but he held strong and powered on. Throughout the personal stuff, he got very sick for a two week period. It started with a lower immune system and probably turned it into something like the flu. There were several days where he wasn’t able to eat, and then the whole thing was capped off with laryngitis (his throat and voice were still hoarse, so if you talked to him, that’s why he sounded funny). As soon as possible he was hydrating and getting tons of protein and food in. Chris essentially had almost four weeks of crap training due to this illness, and we had to adjust everything within three weeks to account for it. It adjusted elongated our taper (which is typically short, given our programming method) and prevented any heavier work in those last few weeks.</p>
<p>On top of all of that, Chris’ shoulder had been bothering him when he benched heavy. He decided that he would convert over to a close grip and use it during the meet. It was his idea, and a good one because it just wasn’t worth it to risk a serious injury at this meet.</p>
<p>Chris warmed up well on the squat. His major cue is to get his “knees out”; it’s something Mike yells when he’s squatting heavy. It’s been something they’ve been working on since nationals, and it’s improved. I noticed that he was kind of slow out of the bottom on some of the lighter warm-ups, so I cued him to be “sharp” out of the bottom. It seemed to help quite a bit, but I was still worried that all of the illness was going to limit him. I still have his warm-ups written down, and he took 405, 475, 540, and 575, and opened with 277.5/611.78. This was really cool because it’s OVER what his heaviest squat was in his first meet (right at 600) in 2010. He hit the opener no big deal, so we went with our plan of hitting 290/639.33 on the second. Based on how the second looked, I was either going to pick 300/661.38 or 302.5/666. I ended up picking the former because it’s still a HUGE PR on the squat (he missed his third attempt in two meets in 2011). He hit the third attempt solidly and I chalk it up to the new programming change we made on his heavy squat days; multiple heavy sets on the squat intensity day (it’ll be in the new e-book).</p>
<p>That 300kg squat tied the heaviest in the super heavy weight class, and Chris did so weighing over 20kg less than Paul Thompkins, who also squatted 300kg. On a side note, Chris jammed his finger on my chest when we collide-hugged after the 300kg squat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since Chris was using a closer grip on bench, his bench numbers weren’t competitive to have a shot at winning the super heavy class; Paul opened at 192.5/423! Paul is two years older than Chris, so we’ll see where Chris is at after two more years of benching. The point is that Paul took 40kg lead after both lifters hit their third attempts. I was also following Levi Perillo’s lifting since his openers were competitive with Chris’ to win second place. Chris smoothed through his bench attempts, finishing with 170/374.8. Not terrible for a close grip bench.</p>
<p>After the bench, Chris had a 15kg lead on Levi for second place. Levi opened at 260/572 on deadlift, missed his second at 270, and waived his third. Chris was absolutely smoking his warm-ups and opened at a warm-up weight of 270/595.24, so he ensured his lead over Levi for second place. After Chris’ opener, <a href="/blog/2012/03/ipf-judge-cathy-marksteiner/" target="_blank">Cathy Marksteiner</a> said, “Justin…” and left her jaw hanging open before closing it with her hand. She was impressed with his speed. Meanwhile, Paul pulled 300kg on his second attempt to solidify an 810kg total over Chris’ 765kg that he would have after his second deadlift at 295/650.36. So first place was out of reach, and second place was secured. Some guys might be content with that.</p>
<p>Last year Chris said, “I want to pull 700 at the Arnold.” The choices close to a 700 are either 320/705.47, or 317.5/699.98. Well, the latter ain’t 700. When Chris walked off the platform after his easy second attempt at 295/650.36, he said, “I want 705.” 650 wasn’t as fast as I wanted it to be, so I put in the attempt at 315/694 knowing that I could change it. As Mike and I talked about what he should pull to get third place, I said, “You think I should give Chris 705?” He didn’t hesitate and said, “Yeah, he’s go it.” We both knew it would be hard, but were confident. Still, I was still nervous over him being sick. I walked up to Chris as he was sitting with his headphones on. I mouthed the words, “Do you want 700?” He shook his head yes with a crazy look in his eye. I said, “Okay. Right. Fucking. Now.” I don’t know why, but that became my phrase for Chris on this day.</p>

<p>I went and changed his attempt. It was almost out of my hands. Meanwhile Alex hit his third attempt, and Mike barely missed his last. I was heartbroken for Mike, because it was such a close lift, but I knew I had to be “game on” for Chris. Usually I don’t pull the guys up out of the chair until they are 2 or 3 attempts out, but Chris was standing up with 6 attempts out. He was shaking. And pacing. We tightened his belt, and approached the curtain. They loaded his bar. Chris had tears in his eyes, his adrenaline was so high. My adrenaline spiked with each lifter. I had previously thought I could get more amped than when Alex was solemnly singing Johnny Cash in a deep voice before his last deadlift; it was like he was giving a death-filled sermon. But as I type this, I have a release of adrenaline thinking about Chris lifting. It’s always been that way in the three years I’ve known him.</p>
<p>A month out from the Arnold, I had a 45 minute phone conversation in which I told him how I wanted him to use imagery, a visualization technique to mentally prepare for the meet. Basically you relax the body and mind with deep breathing, and then visualize every sensory detail of the upcoming performance. I had him visualize the warm-up process all the way through each lift. He visualized squatting at least 660 and deadlifting 700 several times a week. He had been there before; now it was time to make it happen.</p>
<p>His bar was almost loaded, and I pulled one ear phone out and just repeated the phrase, “Right. Fucking. Now.” I always aim to amp the lifter up, then right as they are about to walk away, I give them their cues. Chris’ cues were “speed” and “smooth”.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXlgEPzEU8g" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>To me, the bar speed was slow off the floor, but in retrospect I think my own adrenaline slowed the moment down. I yelled “smooth” over and over as the bar passed his knees. There was shaking in his posterior chain as it struggled to maintain the tension to extend the hip. But Chris didn’t let the bar stop and locked out seven hundred and five fucking pounds. Jubilation. I remember <a href="http://youtu.be/g9lj-DI7IEE" target="_blank">the day that Chris first deadlifted 600</a>. Since that days he’s been “Chris 600” in my phone, and I’ve been waiting for the day he deadlifted 700 to change it to “Chris 700”. You bet your ass I changed it.</p>
<p>It was awesome to see Chris overcome the personal stuff, the sickness, and step up and want to go for that 705. As the announcer said, he did it just for the love of it. And that’s why he’s gonna keep getting better.</p>
