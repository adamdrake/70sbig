<p>This NAPF meet was Alex’s third meet, and he’s really starting to flourish as a lifter. He has a good base from playing DIII collegiate football for four years. He’s a great squatter, a fantastic bencher, and was relatively new to deadlift when he started powerlifting. At the end of last year Alex moved back up to the north east, so he’s been training on his own with a template we talked about last summer. Since nationals in August, he’s put a focus on only pausing on the bench (every single rep). He could double or triple 405, but was only able to hit around 381 at Nationals — it was a skill he needed to learn. As you can see, it paid off with a successful 402 on his third attempt.</p>
<p>Alex typically deadlifts better when he’s with me, and I think the primary reason is because I settle him down a bit and give him one thing to think about. I don’t recall having to really fix anything in the warm-up room, maybe the angle of his torso in the set up, but I cued “smooth” on his lockout because he had never locked out anything about 550, so I was concerned that he’d have the “tut-tut-tut” hitching lockout. He didn’t, and 573 turned out to be a pretty simple rep.</p>

<p>I did, however, kind of fuck up his second deadlift. I was taking a short break and was talking to someone in the crowd during the break between when the guys were done warming up and the start of deadlifts. Since Alex’s opener was so light (his last warm-up), he opened first, and when I was walking in the hallway I heard them call his name. I got to the curtain as he was finishing the rep, and in the midst of my apologizing forgot to put in his second attempt. That means that they gave an automatic increase of 2.5 kilos (so from about 455 to 460 lbs). After some confusion, Mike finally said, “Just wave the attempt.” Duh. So we waived the attempt, took the “real” second attempt in the warm-up room (thanks to Shawn, Mel, Jeremy, and Bijan for loading the bar pretty quickly) with 515. It was easy, so I ran out and put in 573 for his third. 573 was higher than we originally planned, but I felt he had a lot in the tank (his previous best was 551). Before he actually did the attempt, I was thinking he could do 581 or 586, but I didn’t want to push it given that I was still worried about the possible hitching lockout. It’s always better to be slightly conservative and get the rep compared to pulling the trigger and missing the rep (assuming the lift isn’t necessary for the win and it isn’t the lifter’s long-standing goal).</p>
<p>As for squat, Alex’s squats were a joke. He smoked his third at 589. I had been cuing him to “control” the descent through the warm-ups, and he actually did that pretty well on the first and second attempts. I didn’t cue it on the third attempt, because I wanted him to be crazy. In my “attempt prep” I mainly challenged him to go out and hit it. With Alex, I just cue “wait” so that he remembers to wait for the judge, other than that, I let him go weapons free on his squat and bench and instead just help to amp him up.</p>
<p>Alex is a lot of fun to coach, and he’s really friggin’ strong. The things he needs to work on are being more systematic with his training (which is partly my fault for not checking in on it regularly) and to develop his deadlift. By having a more direct focus on what he hits on his heavy squat and bench days, those lifts will continue to develop nicely. As for the deadlift, I think he should rack pull heavy twice a month to train the posterior chain lockout; he doesn’t have any issues off the floor due to his good base of squatting musculature. We’ll add them in within the context of our “advanced TM” method of programming. Lastly, he’ll include some fun junk-yard-style conditioning because he’s a certified fire fighter and is still applying for full time positions.</p>
<p>Overall, Alex had a solid meet and I think he’ll easily hit his goal of totaling over 1600 at the next meet. I see at least a 600 squat, some improvement on his 402 bench, and at least a 600 deadlift in the 120 class. Tuttles.</p>

    Cathy and I hit a pose on stage, Mike Tuchscherer laughs in background
  </p>
</div>
<p>I’ve seen Cathy Marksteiner at some meets in the past, and she’s always been really amusing to interact with. This past weekend she was working the table and ultimately coddled me when I kept screwing things up. I’m only half joking, but she and some other IPF officials made the meet fun for a coach.</p>
<p>I was unaware that she was <a href="http://www.usapowerlifting.com/halloffame/women/cathy_marksteiner/index.shtml" target="_blank">inducted into the USAPL Hall of Fame</a>. She’s been in the sport of powerlifting for over 30 years. That article quoted her as saying, “It’s all about friendships and relationships across the US and World!” That’s obviously true given that she hit a front double biceps pose with me on the stage (pictured above). Below is a video of her competing at the 2009 IPF Master’s World Championships. If you ever see Cathy at a meet, strike up a conversation because she’s easy to get along with. There are good people in powerlifting.</p>

  <p>Mike’s goals for this meet were to go 9/9 and total at least 1550 (if all the lifts were good, he would have had 1552). But the theme of the day was “trouble” for Mike.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>During the squat warm-ups, I noticed that Mike’s knees were sorta forward at the bottom of the squat. Lately he’s been using high bar and front squats on his volume day, and it seemed that he developed a bit of “forwardness” in his squat. I brought this up to him, but we decided not to try and cue it all that much. Instead, I was more concerned with cuing “speed” on the descent. At 2011 USAPL Raw Nationals, I thought Mike’s lack of speed on the descent limited him in his bounce, and it also facilitated the judges in red-lighting his third attempt in that meet. My emphasis on a fast descent would ensure he gets the full stretch-reflex out of his hamstrings and probably help him achieve some depth. He looked better during the final few warm-ups. Note that it’s possible he sits back better with heavier weight (anything over, say, 475); some lifters will look different with light stuff than heavy stuff.</p>

    Mike's third attempt squat -- it was red lighted on depth
  </p>
</div>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I can’t remember his opening squat well (since we don’t have video on it), but I remember that it wasn’t as fast as I would have liked — both on the descent and ascent. Our original plan was to go from 240/529 to 255/562, but he was slow, so I called for 252.5/555. He was red lighted on that attempt. Mike wanted 581, but I called for 260/573 and cued speed on the descent and to get deeper. He was deeper — deep as he could possibly go on that day — was red lighted again. Here is the official IPF/USAPL ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving the Chief Referee’s signal the lifter must bend the knees and lower the body until the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of the knees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially means that the “crease of the hip” is lower than “the top-most visible portion of the knee”. Very fair. Standing at a 45 degree angle from behind, I could see how it would be difficult to clear Mike on the second attempt. However, I thought he was good on the third attempt, though I remember thinking it was still close. In retrospect, I should have focused more on depth after the red-lighted second attempt. I should have cued “knees out” and “depth” instead of still focusing on speed with depth. I felt that if he went down fast that he’d actually hit depth and catch a bounce for a pretty easy squat, but he has learned to be a bit slow on the descent. But, Mike and I both agree that he physically could not have gotten any deeper on that rep.</p>
<p>Mike was pretty pissed off over missing two squats, and comically threatened to quit powerlifting and become a janitor. He was legitimately irritated, but we got focused back in to hit our bench numbers. One thing at a time in powerlifting.</p>
<p>Mike opened with a simple 140/308 opener, which is nice considering that his first meet in 2010 he only benched 281. We took 147.5/325, and then called for a solid 155/341 on the third attempt. It was a good call, because I think he would only have been able to hit 2.5kg above that (and it would have been a limit rep). Mike has made a good, consistent progress on bench and has even developed a good method of using ladder benches for the volume day (to be discussed in the new e-book).</p>
<p>At the start of deadlift, Mike’s goal was to stay ahead of Randy Cairns, a 47 year old lifter in the 120+ weight class. We didn’t realize it at first, but this became a battle for third place in the super heavy class. We took the standard easy opener on the platform at 250/550. Then we took 272.5/600 as the intermediary jump, but the lockout was, to me, uncomfortably slow. It wasn’t necessarily hard, but I would have loved to see Mike rip the shit out of that attempt. Meanwhile Cairns had hit that weight on his second attempt right before Mike. We called for 287.5/633, which made Cairns opt for 277.5/611 to stay ahead of Mike (assuming Mike hit the 287.5kg), but he missed it on his third attempt (hard to make multiple near maximal deadlifts). So we made a weight change to 290/639, a lift that would tie Mike and Randy with Mike winning with a lighter body weight.</p>
<p>I knew the lockout would be rough, so I cued a smooth lockout. The bar left the ground fast, passed the knees fast, and then slowed down so much as it neared lockout. Mike was literally only several inches from lockout when his knees shifted forward slightly, relieving tension and stalling the rep. Check the video. I’m upset that I didn’t cue a “fast lockout” since that could have helped, but from now on I will cue Mike to get his “hips through”. Had he pushed them through, possibly thinking about flexing the glutes, then he may have been able to struggle through that lockout. Randy ended up winning third place in the 120+, a position that Mike would have solidified with white lighted squats or a good third attempt deadlift. Congrats to Randy. It’s also interesting that Mike thought he would only place as high as fifth in either the 120 or 120+ class, and he ended up with a shot at a bronze medal in the 120+. You never know what can happen.</p>
<p>Mike finished with:</p>
<p>Squat – 240/529</p>
<p>Bench – 155/341</p>
<p>Deadlift – 272.5/600</p>
<p>Total 667.5/1470 (goal was 1550, will hit it at Nationals)</p>
<p>Mike has a few things to work on. The first item relates to the squat depth issue. I think we can move his stance in a little bit. If the stance is too wide, then it’s harder to get externally rotated at the hip (via shoving the knees out). External hip rotation prevents any impingement with the upper femur and the ASIS (hip bone), including the mass between those bones. More external rotation would allow for more hip flexion while maintaining good posture in the lower back. However, this is dependent on the mobility to actually shove the hips out. I think we can improve Mike’s mobility with specific lacrosse ball work on the external rotators (while in hip flexion) as well as opening up the anterior hip. Lastly, he can improve his ankle flexibility to allow a) a more acute dorsiflexion that will facilitate a deeper squat and b) the shin to have a better lateral angle coming off of the ankle joint whilst his hips aim to externally rotate. I’d also like him to start working on the speed of his heavier squats, but that might open up as a result of improved mobility.</p>
<p>As for his bench, we’ll keep working on it and improving it gradually. Mike bought a slingshot at the expo, so I think it will be a tool that will help his bench training. We’ll be learning about ways to program it within the context of our template and programming strategy. As for his deadlift, I think he should have an emphasis on rack pulls between now and nationals. He’s never really had an issue with getting the bar off the floor, but his long femurs create a disgustingly horrendous lever arm during lockouts. Rack pulls will allow him to handle heavy lockouts which will prevent what happened on his last deadlift. He’ll be back with a vengeance at nationals, I assure you. And probably in the 120 class.</p>

  <p>The 2012 NAPF Raw Challenge is sanctioned under the <a href="http://www.adfpa.com/IPF-NorthAmerica/" target="_blank">North American Powerlifting Federation</a>, which is under IPF ruling. It’s a step up from USAPL and a step down from IPF Worlds and was our first international competition (you could compare it to the Pan American Championships with Olympic weightlifting). You can view all of the results <a href="http://nextlifter.com/OnlineScoreBoard/Arnold_Raw_Challenge.htm" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>The primary method of admission to this meet for USAPL members was to lift at the 2011 Raw Nationals and have at least a 375 Wilks total. Only 75 lifters were accepted including Chris, Mike, and Alex. Alex originally planned to lift in the 105kg class, but decided he didn’t want to lose at least 20 pounds, so moved to the 120kg class. Mike originally was going to lift in the 120 class, but figured he would only be able to make 5th place in either class (based on his top numbers), and decided not to worry about losing the weight (he weighed in at 280, so about 16 pounds over the 120/264 limit), especially since he has to do so for an Air Force PFT every six months. Chris lifted in the 120+ class.</p>

<p>All three of my guys were lifting in the same flight. I’ve handled five lifters in the same meet before, yet they were in different flights or sessions. Having three guys in a flight of 15 was a different experience. There were times when Alex and Mike were following each other and Chris was up only five attempts later. I actually missed coaching Alex’s first squat because I was putting Mike’s second attempt in at the table.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>Overall I’d grade my coaching as a B, mostly because of what happened during Alex’s deadlift. There was a short break between the bench and deadlift sessions, and after I got the guys warmed up, I stepped out into the crowd to have a mental breather. I got a little distracted by giving information to some people out there (specifically Renee, haha), and as I was walking in in the hallway, I heard the announcer call Alex’s name. I sprinted to the back behind the curtain and caught him as he finished the lift. It wasn’t a big deal because it was actually his last warm-up on the platform (and he obviously smoked it), but I felt terrible. I was apologizing to Alex, and he kept saying, “Hey man, it’s cool. It was easy.” In the midst of all that shit, I forgot to put in his second attempt since I never walked out in front of the curtain. If a minute goes by, they give you an automatic 2.5kg increase on the attempt. Alex’s opener was 207.5/456, and so his official second attempt was 210/462. The rules prevent the coach from making a weight change, so I was feeling like a dumbass.</p>
<p>I figured, “Okay, I’ll just have him take the attempt, pic a weight for the third, and then go in the back and have him hit a second-attempt-weight so he’s prepped for the third.” However that would add an additional warm-up rep. I think it was Mike who said, “Just wave the attempt.” Fucking DUH. We waved the attempt, and I had Alex hit an easy 515 in the warm-up room (thanks to Jeremy, Mel, and Shawn for loading the bar). As for what happened on the third attempt, you’ll have to wait for my write up on Alex. The point is that I kind of fucked up the second attempt, but it ended up not being a big deal.</p>
<p>Other than that, I got the guys warmed up on time and properly, had them ready for their attempts, and made some really good calls on weight jumps. Chris and Alex both had awesome days while Mike’s day was not so good. Overall, the three of them went 23/27 (including Alex’s waved 2nd deadlift) with 6 PR’s. As far as actual cues, I was spot on with Chris (with some help during warm-ups from Mike, who trains with Chris) and Alex, but I regret not having better cues for Mike’s squats (to get a faster descent and more depth) and his deadlift (to finish the lockout), but I’ll save that for their individual write ups. We learned various things during the success and failures, and it will only make us better coaches, programmers, and lifters.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other notable stories associated with this meet, but I wasn’t able to follow them due to the coaching. Reigning 125 National Champion (note that the weight classes were different at this meet) Mike Tuchscherer probably didn’t have as good of a day as he wanted to, but he still squatted 325/715, benched 197.5/434, and deadlifted 355/781 (I believe the squat and deadlift were World Records?). Reigning 100kg National Champion, Matt Nolan (competing in the 105kg class), is probably disappointed that he strained a lat while warming up for deadlift, but he was riding a 250/550 squat and 175/385 bench. I’m pretty sure his second squat was a mis-load. Both guys are USA World Team members after their performance at nationals last August.</p>
<p>Overall, the meet was run very well. I heard of some mis-loads, including the one with Matt Nolan’s squat, but I don’t think it happened often. The judges were all nice folks, and I enjoyed my interaction with the women working the table (again). The announcers were also very good in that they kept everything relevant. They would explain how a particular lift would effect the standings and had good commentary throughout the whole session. The announcers were WAY better than the USAW announcers. Just saying.</p>
<p>We had a great time. I didn’t get a chance to thank the loaders and judges, but their work is appreciated. It takes a lot of work to make a solid meet, and USAPL improves with every big event we attend. I also didn’t get a chance to interview Matt, Mike T., or other friends we’ve made (like Richard Wilcox), but it was good to see everyone and we look forward to seeing them in Texas for nationals.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Thanks to Ellee for filming all the attempts!</em></p>

  <p>While the fellas were weighing in on Friday, Jennifer Thompson was busy with a World Record performance in the NAPF Raw Challenge. This is a video of her final deadlift, but she had alreadysquatted 142.5/313.5 and benched 136.5/300.3. That’s right, a woman weighing right under 132 lbs benched 300 lbs. Sounds like some of you need to step up your bench game, huh? This video is of her final deadlift at 195kg/429lbs. Amazing.</p>

  <p>The Pro GNC Deadlift Competition is an invitation only event where the only contested lift is the deadlift. 15 men are selected along with 8 women. There are two scoring categories: 1) absolute weight and 2) Wilks formula. The criteria for selecting participants are:</p>
<p> Men’s Competitor Criteria: Minimum 320kg Deadlift and Minimum 200 Wilks Score</p>
<p> Women’s Competitor Criteria: Minimum 200 Wilks Score</p>
<p>The event occurred on the main stage inside the expo and was fantastic. The seating was good yet there was plenty of standing room. The music was loud, the announcers were solid (they were the same guys at the NAPF Raw Challenge that our guys lifted in), and the energy was high. Here are some notable lifts (I wasn’t able to record everything).</p>
<p>Kimberly Walford pulled 512 weighing 136 pounds! (not my video)</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

<p>Ian Bell pulled an amazing 810 pounds at 19 years old and 196 lb body weight!</p>

</div>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gillingham" target="_blank">Brad Gillingham</a>, who is a living legend, wrecked shop as usual. Here’s his second attempt at 826:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

<p>And Gillingham’s third attempt at 837. He’s 45 years old! Seeing him lifting in person was an experience.</p>

</div>

<p>Other notables include Carl Yngvar Christensen (pulled 832 on third, Gillingham went up 2.5kg to beat him) and Alyssa Hitchcock (who is attractive, <a href="http://youtu.be/n7na2OVtGEs" target="_blank">here’s a vid from 2011</a>). Everyone was notable in this competition; they wouldn’t be in it if they weren’t.</p>

  <p>As most of you know, the Arnold Sport Festival occurred this past weekend. This post will be a quick synopsis of the weekend and focus on the event instead of our experiences. Chris, Mike, and Alex (the three friends who I coached in the raw powerlifting meet) got there Wednesday, Brent, his lady friend, and I got there Wednesday. Ellee Carlson (who is head of the 70’s Big Chicago Chapter) also got in on Thursday. <a href="http://www.crossfitannandale.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy Wolfe</a> and friends (Mel and Bijan) got in late Thursday night. This was our hang-out nucleus throughout the weekend but it would split apart depending on the schedule.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/03/2012-03-01_18-54-56_363-2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6474" data-permalink="/blog/2012/03/the-arnold-quick-recap/2012-03-01_18-54-56_363-2/" data-orig-file="/2012/03/2012-03-01_18-54-56_363-2.jpg" data-orig-size="400,281" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;DROID BIONIC&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.6&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.059973&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="2012-03-01_18-54-56_363-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/03/2012-03-01_18-54-56_363-2.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/03/2012-03-01_18-54-56_363-2.jpg" src="/2012/03/2012-03-01_18-54-56_363-2.jpg" alt="" title="2012-03-01_18-54-56_363-2" width="400" height="281" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6474" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, it was a fantastic weekend, albeit busy. Any time spent with my friends was a good one, but there were many events and spectacles that were very fun. I would highly recommend that everyone actually make plans to attend next year (many of you were unable to attend because of work or cost). If you read this website, then you have an invested interest in all things strength, power, fitness, training, and having a good time. “The Arnold” portrays all of that and more. There simply isn’t an event that has what The Arnold has: powerlifting, professional deadlift, professional strongman, Olympic weightlifting, various products to purchase, and every big name associated with every sport and activity.</p>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>There is, of course, all of the fitness and bodybuilding people to meet and events to attend. Overall, I found this crowd to be very interesting. It further distanced myself from the culture, but some of them are very similar to “us” in that they are nice people who are involved in an alternate training methodology.</p>
<p>If you intend on attending next year, I would recommend staying as late as you can. I regrettably left Sunday morning (my apologies Lindsay Taylor! It would have cost a lot more money to change my flight!), and I missed all of the weightlifting on Sunday. I also wasn’t able to peruse the expo in full to generate humorous content for the site. Next year I’ll be staying until Monday to ensure I get to see everything I want to.</p>
<p>I assumed I would have more time to chat with readers, hang out with people, spend time with coaches and lifters, and meet some “celebrities” (the strongman pros, Ronnie Coleman, Erin Stern, etc.), but I just didn’t have the time. This was a bummer, but there is one thing that really made my experience problematic: USAW.</p>
<p>USAW altered their schedule during the rules briefing, and it resulted in a lot of crappy improvements for both the lifters and fans. I heard of several lifters completely missing their session because they weren’t aware of the changes; regardless of whose fault it is, that shouldn’t happen. The biggest problem was that the 94kg session ended well after midnight and the 105kg session started at 8:00AM. This resulted in me and other weightlifting fans getting only 3 hours of sleep. I had to go back to the hotel and nap after the 105kg session so I could be coherent the rest of the day — this essentially effected my weekend and prevented me from attending specific events and hanging out with my friends. I will be doing a separate post that includes more details on this topic.</p>
<p>For all of the readers that said hello at various points throughout the weekend, thank you. It was nice to chat with you for a few seconds and I apologize that I didn’t have more time. I was constantly involved in doing something or en route to do something and barely had any time to “dick around”. There wasn’t even time for my friends and I to hang out, eat, and drink beer, much less shoot the shit with some really cool readers.</p>
<p>The easiest way to cover the content that I do have from this past weekend is to break it into multiple posts. There will be more than one post each day throughout this week. Also be on the lookout for videos; they’ll be linked in posts but you can watch as their uploaded if you subscribe to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JLascek?feature=mhee" target="_blank">70’s Big YouTube Channel</a>. I’ll also have guest posts from various people that attended.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sean C. asks,</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you see accessory (but heavy) exercises like rack bench presses, board presses, etc… fitting into TM?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Sean,</p>
<p>I don’t. The advanced TM stuff evolved for raw powerlifters, and all of them still make progress on the bench without gadgets. I see gadgets helping a) very advanced lifters improve their rate of force development and b) geared lifters. One of the first things a TM user can do to improve his bench is to do it every week instead of alternating it with the press. Benching heavy twice a month is not what improves the bench. Russian lore would say “Bench, and bench some more.” We could even say that Bulgarian lore would say, “Bench, often and heavy.” Assistance lifts can also help improve the bench, like close-grip bench or weighted dips for direct work and barbell rows and weighted pull-ups for indirect work. They also help the “intermediate level lifter” develop his musculature; if the musculature isn’t balanced then that should be addressed before worrying about fancy gadgets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kel M. asks</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was wondering if you could address programming strength training into a sport thats currently “in-season.” Right now, I’m looking at a rugby season that’s just getting into gear, and I don’t want my strength training to compromise my rugby play. In fact, the reason I got into weightlifting was to get bigger so I wouldn’t get tossed around on the pitch. How would you recommend rectifying the conditioning requirements of rugby while maintaining strength while “in season.” I searched the blogs as best I could, so if you answered this already or something similar, I apologize. Thanks for your help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Kel,</p>
<p>It’s a good question. The way we’ll think about approaching it is altering the volume, frequency, and exercise choice. The volume of your lifting may need to drop so that you can spend that much needed recovery on rugby. It’s not that you’ll be so fatigued from rugby that you’ll have trouble lifting, but you’ll probably have aches, pains, and bruises. Lowering the volume will decrease the work you put on your body when it’s already beat up. For example, if you have a thigh or knee bruise, and then you hit high volume squats, you could be squatting on a structure that isn’t 100% and cause a structural failure (strain, tear, etc.).</p>
<p>The frequency should also decrease so that you don’t bog your body down. Obviously you can’t recover from a full training load AND rugby, so something has to give. If you only have x amount of recovery credits and a full training load costs 75 and rugby costs 50, then you’ll have to drop the training off to 50. You’re practicing twice a week with a game once a week. I suggest you use two training days a week; something similar to my <a href="/files/Articles/Lascek_S&#038;CP_v2.0.pdf" target="_blank">S&amp;C Program</a> (older version, will update in near future).</p>
<p>Exercise selection should change so that you aren’t putting too much structural stress on your body. I’m of the opinion that deadlifts are expendable, given your situation. Instead, use power cleans, cleans, and/or RDLs.</p>
<p>The last concept is related to “auto-regulation” or “fucking intuitive” training. If your body is tired, then don’t lift as heavy. If you’re feeling good, and the bar speed is good, then push a bit. If you’re only training twice a week, you won’t necessarily have to worry about doing too much if you stay in intelligent set/rep schemes. Check out Prilepin’s chart (linked at the beginning of the post) and stick to the lower end range, possibly lower, for your in-season training. Keep me and us updated on how it goes.</p>

<p>We all know the quote well and good. But do you UNDERSTAND it? Do you GET it?</p>
<p>I DON’T THINK YOU DO.</p>
<p>No, it just doesn’t mean you try to win. No, it just doesn’t mean you try to do your best. You go out there, and you <a href="http://youtu.be/MDaB9wj1rIQ" target="_blank">find that fucking dog</a>!</p>
<p>You aren’t supposed to just have another day, walking in circles. Nay, good sir, you step to the challenge of the day, kick in the door, toss a flash bang, sweep your sectors and put two precision rounds in the brain or heart of that THING, that fucking THING, that stands in the way between you and success.</p>
<p>CHOP YOUR FEET — that fullback is comin’, he’s comin’, he’s gonna meet you in the hole. WHO’S GONNA WIN? YOU OR HIM? WHO’S GONNA GET LOWER? BLOW THAT ISO UP, SON!</p>
<p>Hmm, what I’m trying to say is that when your horse isn’t doing his job because he catches the scent of a mare in heat, you un-sheath your glistening broad sword and <a href="http://youtu.be/kHMT8b1hOdM?t=1m5s" target="_blank">CUT HIS FUCKING HEAD OFF</a>. Wait, no, that doesn’t explain it.</p>
<p>Arnold voice:</p>
<p>There are doubters, naysayers. They say that you shouldn’t break the rules. They say you should be afraid to fail. You can’t always win, but don’t be afraid of making decisions. Believe in yourself to keep pushing. NEVER LISTEN TO “YOU CAN’T”. ONLY LISTEN TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU SAY “YES, YOU CAN.” Muhammad Ali was once asked, “How many sit-ups do you do?” He said, “I don’t count my sit-ups, I only start counting when it starts hurting, because that’s when it really counts. That’s what makes you a champion.” Someone out there is working harder, and someone out there is getting smarter. They are winning. Just remember that. <a href="http://youtu.be/h5fg6DO4ztE?t=2m59s" target="_blank">SLEEP FASTER</a>, I WOULD RECOMMEND, AUUGHHHAUUGHHHH!</p>
<p>What is it that you want to do? What is it that you want to accomplish? What the FUCK is standing in your way? Why are you letting it stop you? The 500 pound squat? The dream job? WHAT EXACTLY IS STOPPING YOU FROM DOING IT? A horde of 10,000 Uruk-Hai, no less. Better to just sit this one out, right? After all, it’s safer. Oh, uh, excuse me sir? Kindly leave. Because WE’RE BUSY SHARPENING OUR SWORDS!</p>
<p>You will have to fight every god. damn. inch. You are all on your own. You will be beaten bloody. You will hang by a thread. But in that moment when you think you are too weak to continue, when you lie in a handful of dust, and when you have all but given up hope…you will rise. You will grit your teeth. You will clench your fists. And you will continue fighting. Because it’s too easy to die.</p>
<p>So, c’mon you apes! You wanna live forever?</p>

  <p>Yesterday I neglected elaborating on a lot of the women’s sports because of a lack of time and information. A reader with the username “flipper” provided some insight on the women vying for a spot on the Olympic team this weekend (I linked a video with each name):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primarily, the weight classes to watch are the 58kg class and the 75+ class. The major hitters in here are <a href="http://youtu.be/6kZpYIOlY8k" target="_blank">Sarah Robles</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/D-c9BSHeTXg" target="_blank">Holley Mangold</a> in the 75+, and <a href="http://youtu.be/QVrws9lBeIM" target="_blank">Rizelyx Rivera</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/vWD9T-ObsF4" target="_blank">Amanda Sandoval</a> in the 58kg category. Close following them are 2008 Olympian <a href="http://youtu.be/KRm04WFHrYM" target="_blank">Natalie Burgener</a> in the 63 class, <a href="http://youtu.be/uw_kEOIl0mU" target="_blank">Chioma Amaechi</a> also in the 75+, and <a href="http://youtu.be/_MDz1q-clRA" target="_blank">Hilary Katzenmeier</a> in the 53 class. Keep in mind however that only two spots are available, so I think the lion’s share of the attention will be on the top four or five contenders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I’m pretty confident that Sarah Robles is going to the Olympics – she’s a solid 2% points higher than her rivals in the scoring system, and she really just needs to not have a repeat of her Pan Am troubles to win a spot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second spot will be the real battleground: While Robles’ % score (the same method as the men’s) is 89.6%, the four athletes following her are all between 87.4% and 87.8%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sandoval and Rivera are actually tied at 87.8% of their qualifying total, their best recorded totals are 198 for each of them. Their rankings at any point in time fluctuate. Sandoval is slightly stronger in the snatch, but Rivera slightly better in the clean and jerk – it ain’t over till it’s over. Also, I must say that both of them are just awesome to watch, with some of the most impressive technique I’ve ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Right on their heels is Holley Mangold with an 87.5% score. She’s strong as an ox, but still pretty new to the sport. She’s been making huge strides but isn’t always the most consistent in her lifting – expect amazing things from her, but this particular meet will be hard to predict from her.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And in a very close 5th with an 87.4% score is returning Olympian Natalie Burgener, a long time favorite of the sport. I have heard rumor that she had until recently taken some time off to nurse a tight hip, but she seems to be getting back into full swing and many people are hoping to discover that her comeback was only just beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This list is certainly not exhaustive, I’ve heard amazing training lifts are coming from Amaechi, Katzenmeier is fantastic and has enough heart to surprise us all, and we have a lot of other long time front runners on the start list, but with only two slots on the line I only covered the ones with the top few results in competition – someone could always surprise us on the day of.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Olympic Trials will of course be webcast live via USAW’s website for those of you that can’t make it or have to head home early. Hope this was helpful in getting a feel for the women’s competition – which is unfortunately the only Olympic Trials we’ve earned the right to hold this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Jacob Cloud re-sent me <a href="http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename1/54676/Copy_of_2012_Olympic_Games_Ranking_List_post_JNats_2_9_12_Revision.pdf" target="_blank">THIS DOCUMENT</a>. It shows the top 20 or so American male and female lifters and how they compare to the “world average”. The totals for each lifter are what they have hit in recent and relevant competitions, so note that some of them have improved upon those totals. It gives you an idea of who is contention.</p>
<p>Also, stop messaging me by saying that the men don’t have a spot in the Olympics; they will unless several male lifters drop dead.</p>
<p>If anyone has similar breakdowns for other sports, then feel free to post them and I’ll put them up on the site.</p>
