  <p>The annual Arnold Sport Festival is this weekend, and if you aren’t going, you’ll <a href="/blog/2012/02/where-were-you/" target="_blank">wish you had</a>. It’s the biggest sport festival in the world and will include twice as many competing athletes as the Olympics. There will be over 175,000 people in attendance over the weekend. It will truly be a spectacle. This is a day-by-day guide of the coolest stuff going on. You can also look at the <a href="http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/schedule-of-events/#" target="_blank">official schedule</a> and <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/promo/j4w9k7" target="_blank">purchase tickets</a> to the Expo and special events. .</p>

<p><strong>Locations</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Note that there are two primary locations for the fun stuff. The Greater Columbus Convention Center will be the primary location that includes the Expo, Weightlifting, Powerlifting, Strongman (pro and amateur), etc. Veterans Memorial is only about a mile away and is where all the bodybuilding and figure stuff is going on (including pre-judging, finals, etc.). The Arena Grand Movie Theater will host the Arnold Sport Film Festival, but I can’t imagine myself going over there unless they played Pumping Iron, Predator, or Conan on repeat (which is what they should do). There are much cooler things to see than independent films on high school football or empowered teenage girls who powerlift. I could be wrong, but I prefer to see the live entertainment at the convention center. The LC Pavilion will host the MMA Festival and the “Arnold Party With The Pros” (hang out with pro bodybuilders) — so two demographics I’ll undoubtedly want to avoid. Unless you’re viewing some of the bodybuilding shows (some of us are attending the finals on Saturday night), you’re only going to hang out in the convention center. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]This is the first official day of the entire shindig. There’s some bodybuilding stuff going on at Veteran’s Memorial, but more importantly, there’s <strong>professional boxing on Thursday night</strong>. I’ve never seen boxing in person, so I’ll be attending and primarily shouting, “Hit him! C’mon, hit ’em!”. From what I see on TicketMaster, seating is assigned, so plan accordingly. You can get some tickets in the $20 range. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]<em>Expo</em></p>
<p>Here’s where things get intense. This is Day 1 of the <a href="http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/expo/" target="_blank">Expo</a>, which lasts from 10:30 AM to 6:00 PM. There will be over 700 booths set up of people trying to sell shit, and there will be many fitness celebrities in attendance fulfilling their contractual obligations. I’ll definitely check it out, but this is going to be irritating for someone (like me) who hates large groups of people. Rest assure that with almost 200,000 people in attendance, at LEAST 30% are going to be jackasses. It’s simple statistics. Hopefully we can make up for it by asking people how much they curl and other various questions. Speaking of which, post funny questions to the comments; I’m gonna make a list of stock questions to use when we’re walking around.</p>
<p><em>Powerlifting</em></p>
<p>The Raw USAPL Championships begin at 8 AM (with women and lighter men’s classes) and should end around 1:30 PM. The heavier weight classes (105kg and up, including Chris/Mike/Alex and NolanPower) will be lifting from 2:00PM to 6:00PM. The quality of lifting should be pretty high; to qualify lifters needed a 375 in the <a href="http://www.marylandpowerlifting.com/wilks.asp" target="_blank">Wilke’s formula</a>, and only the first 75 entries were accepted. Raw powerlifting means there isn’t any supportive gear; knee sleeves and belts are allowed. USAPL often receives criticism, but they hold lifters to a high standard (the squats will be deep). There are a lot of good lifters, especially in the second session. I’ve been to two national USAPL Raw meets, and I suspect (hope?) that this one will be of the highest quality.</p>
<p><em>Olympic Weightlifting</em></p>
<p>This event counts for Senior Nationals and the Olympic Trials for USA Weightlifting. Each weight class had to meet a minimum qualifying total in order to compete. The lighter men’s and women classes lift earlier in the day. Notable men’s classes are the 77s (including Chad Vaughn) at 2:30PM, 85s (including Kendrick Farris) at 5:00 PM, and 94s (with five really good lifters) at 7:30 PM. There is also weightlifting on Saturday, including Donny Shankle at 10:00 AM. If you’ve never seen a national meet, this is a great opportunity to see a lot of different types of lifters.</p>
<p><em>Strongman</em></p>
<p>There will be amateur strongman stuff starting at 8:00 AM and running until 1:30PM. But the money maker is the <a href="http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/home/sports-and-events/strongman-classic.html" target="_blank">Arnold Stronngman Classic</a> with its <a href="http://www.arnoldstrongmanclassic.com/competitors.html" target="_blank">impressive list of competitors</a>. Unfortunately we are gonna miss this since it’s 2:00 to 4:00 PM schedule will be exactly when Chris/Mike/Alex are lifting, but there is more of it on Saturday. This would be amazing to see in person.</p>
<p><em>Fencing</em></p>
<p>I put this on here because apparently you can go and try it out. If there’s time, I definitely want to get my fence on. It’s just like Game of Thrones, right?</p>
<p><em>Other</em></p>
<p>There’s also plenty of other things I didn’t highlight. There is CrossFit (9AM to 6PM), Gymnastics (8AM to 10AM), Mighty Mitts grip challenge (4PM to 5PM), Table Tennis (1PM to 7PM), Boxing/MMA stuff (noon to 10PM) and all kinds of other frivolous bullshit (like cheerleading, fitness clinics, zumba, etc.). [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]There’s a lot of amazing stuff happening this day. I’ll only list the major differences from Friday, cause a lot of the same stuff is going on (like fencing, CrossFit, teenager shit, and dance/cheerleading). Note that the Mighty Mitts grip challenge is 3:30 to 4:30PM.</p>
<p><em>Expo</em></p>
<p>This is the same, but it opens earlier at 9AM and runs until 6PM.</p>
<p><em>Weightlifting</em></p>
<p>Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here? Donny Shankle has two chances to make the Olympic team. This is arguably the best shot. Lifting starts at 10:00 AM and will probably last until about noon. Remember that as of now, the men do not have a spot at the Olympics. However, if all the male competitors lift like shit a few weeks later at the Pan Ams, they will still earn a spot. The top guys include Chad Vaughn, Kendrick Farris, and Donny Shankle. They are all great lifters, and they are all still Americans, so let’s get behind them in their session. They’ll have another shot to better themselves at the Pan Ams, but flying out of country, going to South America, and eating bad food typically doesn’t result in optimal performance. This weekend will probably be the best shot.</p>
<p><em>Powerlifting – Single Ply Equipped</em></p>
<p>The North American Powerlifting Federation is having its championships at the Arnold. It’s similar to the “Pan Ams” for weightlifting and is a step up from USAPL but a step down from IPF World’s. Women and lighter men’s classes will lift from 9AM to 1PM, and heavier classes will lift from 2PM to 5:30PM. Expect big lifts and top levels of competition.</p>
<p><em>Arm Wrestling Finals</em></p>
<p>The preliminaries occur on Friday, but these finals last from 9AM to 10AM. I don’t think Stallone will be there. Still would be kinda cool to watch…maybe?</p>
<p><em>Strongman</em></p>
<p>Luckily this is going on since I will miss Friday’s events. Lasts from 1:30PM to 3:30PM and will be fucking awesome.</p>
<p><em>GNC ProPerformance Amp Pro Deadlift</em></p>
<p>This event is just big deadlift fun. Brad Gillingham has <a href="http://youtu.be/4NIqkF_B-wY" target="_blank">pulled 400kg</a> in this competition in the past. Big deadlifts, nothin’ else. It’s one hour after the Strongman Classic finishes.</p>
<p><em>Other</em></p>
<p>Of course there’s other shit like CrossFit, World Jump Rope Championships, and table tennis. But that’s all secondary to the cool, big, and heavy stuff.</p>
<p><em>Bodybuilding Finals</em></p>
<p>Of course the fucking Men’s finals are going on Saturday night. This is the second biggest bodybuilding show of the year, and Arnold is going to be on stage. I don’t know if there’s much of a chance to see or meet him if you don’t pay the money to attend the “meet and greet”, but this will be the closest I’ve ever been to him…</p>
<p>But seriously, some of us are going to the show, and it should be, at the very least, entertaining. The event is at the auditorium.</p>

<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Honestly, there’s not a lot of stuff going on. Most people will be going home. Unless you like women’s weightlifting, amateur strongman, running a 5K, or the standard CrossFit/cheerleading/fencing/MMA/boxing shit, you’re not gonna be sticking around on this day. All of the badass stuff is happening Friday and mostly Saturday. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Communicating</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]The easiest way to communicate with people over the weekend will be on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">@70sBig</a>). I can provide basic updates and let people know where the action is (regarding events or food). You guys can twat at me, but if you want everyone to see it then maybe we should use a #70sBig hash tag? If we use an #Arnold hash tag, it’ll get lost in the sea of 200,000 people. If you have a better suggestion, post it in the comments. I look forward to meeting and hanging out with those of you attending.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t be afraid to come up and say hello. We are all just normal people and you don’t need to put anyone on a pedestal unless its Arnold himself. Come up, say hello, and we’ll probably shoot the shit with you. I’ve had people ask for pictures, which was weird for me, but just remember that there’s no reason you shouldn’t say hello. If we have some time, then we can talk training, programming, and whatnot too. You’re not a bother! Just be aware that if we are in the middle of the meet (i.e. I’m coaching) or an event, then it may be brief. Oh, and be prepared for everyone to be way more weird than you anticipate. We’ll twat where we’ll hang out on Friday and Saturday nights, so hopefully we can get a fun group together. [/spoiler]</p>
<p>**<em>Special Update</strong></em></p>
<p>[spoiler]This is from a guy named Kyle, who is a Columbus Police Officer with some good information (he put it on the Facebook Fan Page):</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Columbus Police Officer here. Here’s some tips for out-of-towners coming to Columbus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Food: Closest Chipotle is at 401 N. Front St., but it is frequently closed–it is only open during special events, so I don’t know what it’s hours will be during the Arnold. Next closest Chipotle is about an 8 minute drive away from the convention center, in German Village at 488 S. High St. There is a Mongolian BBQ within walking distance of the convention center at Nationwide and Marconi Blvd (just south of Nationwide Arena). If you’re more into experiencing local food, check out <a href="http://www.thetravelchica.com/2011/09/best-restaurants-columbus-liz-lessner-tip-top-bettys-surly-girl/" target="_blank">Liz Lessner’s restaurants</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Closest grocery store to the Arnold is a Giant Eagle at 777 Neil Ave., which about a half mile away from the convention center.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Closest night life for bar hopping is on Park St. Cheapest alcohol is at Brothers bar, but we have the most problems (fights, etc.) there too. My favorite bar is Callahans just down the street. Crowd tends to be a little more mature. I’d avoid Mynt and Musiak, those are occasionally frequented by gang members. Rest of Park Street is pretty safe though.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first Saturday of the month is always the (art) Gallery Hop in the Short North, which is the area just north of the Convention Center along High Street. It’s likely to be even busier than usual because of the warm weather forecasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll one of many police officers you’ll see there patrolling the event itself and the parking lots. We do not have that much crime here in Columbus, but remember it is a metropolitan area, so be smart about hiding your valuables in your car and not leaving gym bags lying around unattended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the information, Kyle.[/spoiler]</p>

  <p><em>Monday’s are devoted to helping the female begin or continue to train. The concepts in this post are also relevant to males.</em></p>
<p>Usually the hard part is getting a female into “training” instead of just “working out” (here’s some help for the transition: <a href="/blog/2011/08/getting-girls-to-train/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-2/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-3/" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/10/getting-girls-to-train-4/" target="_blank">4</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/10/getting-girls-to-train-5/" target="_blank">5</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/10/getting-girls-to-train-6/" target="_blank">6</a>). However, we know that optimal success isn’t solely dependent on the training in the gym, but attention to detail outside of it. When a female experiences lingering soreness or even stalled progress, it’s probably more than just the program; her nutrition is likely to blame.</p>
<p>Nutrition can be looked at in two fundamental ways: total calories and macro nutrients. Solely looking at calories is relevant, but it doesn’t paint the whole picture. Macro nutrients — which include proteins, fats, and carbohydrates — can be more descriptive in describing food’s effect on the body’s hormones. In the case of a sore or stalled female trainee, we’re going to focus on protein intake and meal strategy while also addressing some minor food quality issues.</p>

<p><strong>Protein Requirements</strong></p>
<p>I’ve done various posts on protein in the past. <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">This post</a> cited some of Dr. Di Pasquale’s work in saying that power athletes should get 1.2 to 1.6g of protein per pound of body weight. That’s an impressive amount, yet not exactly relevant to the average training female. Instead, a good guideline is aiming for 1g of protein per pound of body weight. If a female weighs 130 pounds, she should aim for 130g of protein. Simple.</p>
<p>I’ll take this time to remind under-eating females why protein is so helpful and healthy (an excerpt from <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-3/" target="_blank">this post</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Protein won’t make a <del datetime="2012-02-27T15:46:26+00:00">girl</del> female bulky, especially since she not only hasn’t had a history of accidentally becoming bulky but more importantly females only have 5 to 10% of the testosterone that a male has. Instead, protein is the most abundant molecule in the body that is a major structural component of all cells — muscle, organs, hair, and skin — and helps regulate metabolism, form blood cells, and supports the immune system. The average woman is deficient in protein intake, and she will significantly improve her health by consuming more if it…even without exercise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The source of the protein also matters. When <a href="http://www.crossfitannandale.com/" target="_blank">Courtney Modecki</a> works with female clients, she stresses protein quality. She teaches clients to get the majority of their daily protein from something that “had a soul”. In my opinion, animals don’t have souls, and if they did, they would gladly offer it up for someone like me to devour it (this Dovah would eat souls instead of worlds). Get protein from animal sources; if it ran, swam, flew, fell out of it’s mom’s butt, or walked around clucking like an asshole, then eat it. Personally I hate non-egged chickens; you get fined for killing them with your sword!</p>
<p><strong>Meal Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The first order of business to quality meal strategy is eating breakfast. If it’s not happening, then make it happen. The best analogy I’ve heard and use is that your metabolism is akin to a fire. In the morning you build that fire by eating breakfast. Every few hours the fire will start to die down so you rekindle the fire with your next snack or meal. Keeping the fire burning hot and bright will keep the metabolism humming.</p>
<p>Breakfast doesn’t have to be an exaggerated endeavor. Fry a couple eggs with some fruit. If you’re smart, you’ll add bacon. If timing is an issue, then cook it the previous night and warm it up in the morning. A person, male or female, who doesn’t eat breakfast isn’t serious about their life. Period. It’s saying, “I’m okay with being a sluggish piece of shit today,” or “I’m okay with not getting stronger, losing body fat, or increasing muscle.”</p>
<p>The second component of meal strategy is to make sure and eat. It can be a habit for some females to, for whatever reason, not eat. Typically females who begin lifting or doing conditioning will find that they get a voracious appetite, but it may take some time for this to occur. Aim for three meals with an additional snack or two. If you’re simply not hungry, just aim for one snack evenly spaced between meals. But do so with one very important qualification: <strong>Plan all snacks or meals around a quality protein source</strong>. “Quality” means that whole “my food used to have a beating heart” thing.</p>
<p>Even if the rest of the diet sucks, emphasizing protein as the primary part of each meal will improve the macros significantly. If you’re not eating enough, it can help increase the calories. If you ate shitty before, it will help clean the diet up since you’ll eat meat first and not have enough room for lower quality foods. All of the above will have a positive impact on insulin resistance and also improve training. I’ve never had a girl gain fat when using this strategy (and those girls weren’t even conditioning, just lifting).</p>
<p><strong>Marginally Improve Quality</strong></p>
<p>Everything above is very simple and general; the strategies will have the greatest impact on overall nutrition with the least amount of change. However, females should learn what “quality” actually means. Quality means to stop eating the convenient, processed crap that the idiotic feminist magazines spit out. Courtney is big on getting females to “drop the bullshit”: yogurt, granola, lara bars, and whatever else society deems as “healthy”. If your food wasn’t directly involved in the circle of life, then avoid it.</p>
<p>Hydration can also have a positive effect on training and soreness. I wrote about the importance of water in <a href="/blog/2011/09/water-and-protein/" target="_blank">this post</a>, but women often under-hydrate, especially during winter. Colder weather usually means you aren’t sweating, so you don’t think to drink water. Make it a point to hydrate, especially when something negative is happening. Feeling sore? Sick? Light headed? Hungry? Headache? Can’t concentrate? Unless you just chugged some water, do so when you feel bad; it’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Some females may be new to this whole “training” thing. Others may be training veterans, but have ignored paying close attention to their diet. Nutrition knowledge and practice is mutually exclusive from training, yet it will dictate the success of training. First, ensure you’re getting enough protein. Second, plan all the meals around quality protein sources. Third, start cleaning up the quality of food bit b bit. Remember, nutrition is habitual and difficult to alter, so let’s keep it simple. <a href="/blog/2011/08/improving-diet/" target="_blank">Taking little baby steps</a> over time will work better than trying to overhaul it over night. Your training will thank you. So will the animals who donated their soul to you.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Courtney for some ideas for this post.</em></p>

  <p>Well blow me down with a fart, 20 Q&amp;A sessions! That’s about a 4 on the “take it or leave it” scale. It’s <strong>PR Friday</strong>, so post your weekly training PR’s or training updates to the comments. I enjoy seeing how people train and it definitely helps me a lot when you add tidbits of programming by either giving me ideas or confirming others.</p>
<p><strong>Week Review</strong></p>
<p>On Monday I <a href="/blog/2012/02/thanks-d-c/" target="_blank">thanked my DC homies</a> and discussed the topic of <a href="/blog/2012/02/coaching-females/" target="_blank">coaching the female gender</a>. Tuesday I traveled, and Wednesday was a post on being <a href="/blog/2012/02/coaching-brevity/" target="_blank">brief when coaching</a>. Thursday was a reminder that <a href="/blog/2012/02/this-is-what-were-up-against/" target="_blank">there’s no easy way to success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>My reading list this week included:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=111530641&#038;page=1" target="_blank">Gant Grimes “Hybrid Programming”</a> — This is by my dear friend, Gant Grimes, who is an exceptional man. All of these new CrossFitters don’t really understand that strength training was taboo several years ago, and Gant’s post on the CF discussion boards was monumental at the time. It had a large effect on my development and programming, and I just read through it all again last night. It’s something everyone here should check out. While there are some things that I’m sure Gant would change, the overall message still applies. (This was originally posted on the CF discussion boards, but it was summarized nicely in this post — all of it is Gant’s writing)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cathletics.com/forum/showpost.php?p=80808&#038;postcount=4" target="_blank">Judo tips by Gant</a> — Since we’re talking about Gant, he coaches Judo and other martial arts, and is a very, very good coach. I’ve gotten to learn from him briefly, and need to get back on a judo mat somewhere. Here are tips if you decide to give it a go.</p>
<p><a href="http://weightliftingexchange.com/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=438&#038;Itemid=60" target="_blank">Bulgarian Training on Weightlifting Exchange</a> — If you’ve heard of Bulgarian training but never really understood it, this will give you some good background. It’s focus is high intensity with specificity, yet is dependent on an advanced trainee with balanced musculature. In other words, lesser advanced trainees would need to adapt the concepts to their needs.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Biological_clock_human.PNG" target="_blank">Biological clock graph</a> — I thought this was interesting. I was reading about sleep cycles on Wikipedia when I saw it.</p>
<p><a href="http://education.athletesperformance.com/articles-2/articles-from-ap-specialists/new-advancements-on-beta-alanine-dosing/" target="_blank">Beta-Alinine Dosing</a> — Some new research is showing that dosing for beta-alinine is probably relevant to body weight (unsurprisingly), but more importantly beta-alinine may be a good supplement for short, intense, anaerobic endurance training. Interesting.</p>
<p>Now onward with the Q&amp;A! Keep in mind that while some questions are specific, they will include general concepts applicable to everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This is a shortened (TL;DR) version of a question from CriedTheFox. The whole thing was really funny.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR I was pretty fucking fat, then wasn’t, now I’m much stronger but a little fat. That’s like the PB&amp;J of stories…classic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR #2 I weigh 193lbs at 5’6″ and squat 315lbs, what do i need to do to squat 455lbs and weigh 175lbs?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also: For example. How the FUCK. does Brent weigh sub 160 at 5’5” and squat well into the 400s?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear CriedTheFox,</p>
<p>I like you, you’re funny. Let it be known that if people comment on the site regularly, I will go more out of my way to help them. It is known. There are various points of emphasis to make here.</p>
<p>The first is that your acknowledgement that Brent has trained longer than you is very relevant. Consider the differences of both of your histories. Brent was a skinny teenager who fucked around with stuff and then fucked around with weightlifting. He was okay, then got decently strong, then learned about proper nutrition and is much stronger at lighter body weights (and undoubtedly healthier for it). You were, as you say, fat, and then used a calorie deficit and calorie burning program to lose weight. Then you started training. I can assure you, there was a time when Brent only squatted 315. We all have an expression of our genotype, but what we do in our lives will have an effect on the phenotype. In other words, given your genetic predisposition, you can still alter the process to adapt, even if your adaptation won’t be as significant as someone who a) was born in a way that would make them better than you or b) who has been trying to adapt longer than you.</p>
<p>The second concept is that I’m unaware of your training program. That will definitely play a role in your success. To be honest, the main aspect is going to be “consistency” over time. Squatting twice a week for the next 18 months is going to have a profound effect on your squatting, even if we weren’t concerned with the weight. However, altering the rep ranges will have an effect on the strength/size ratio of development. Fewer reps results in strength increases without size increases. There is a really good discussion complete with program examples (including “low repetition programs”) in “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1" target="_blank">FIT</a>“.</p>
<p>However, I know that your goal isn’t to not get bigger muscles, but instead to decrease body fat. You mentioned that your diet is not optimal, and this will clearly have a profound effect on your body fat, but also your program success. One important aspect is insulin sensitivity. If you are not sensitive to insulin, then your whole hormonal situation is fucked. Things won’t work as well as they need to, and this is why I give a shit about quality. Besides, if you have quality sensitivity to insulin, then you can generate a better anabolic response to improve training. I’m actually going to do a nutrition post next week on the concept of insulin sensitivity. But if you wanted specifics I suggest a consultation; I’m going to be vamping up the consultation process and am bringing someone in that has similar methodology for nutrition consultations.</p>
<p>The basic tenet is train and eat smart consistently over time. Align the program and nutrition to meet your goals. Solidify the foundation before focusing on the minutiae.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Craig R. asks</em>,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was thinking about something today regarding lever arms, hopefully I can make sense of this over email. A more efficient lever arm seems to be one that has more muscle mass on each lever. If that holds true, would a taller lifter benefit more from a higher rep scheme 3×8-10, that would produce some hypertrophy in addition to making strength gains, versus an average lifter who has normal lever arms. Or should 5 reps be enough to elicit strength and mass in most lifters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On one of the Starting Strength roundtable vids on Tall Lifters it sounded like for someone 6’5″, such as myself, I would have to weigh close to 300 pounds to be an effective powerlifter, based on the lever arms. I weigh 255 right now at probably 20%bf. I don’t want to weigh 300 nor be a powerlifter, but I would like to do a competition sometime for squat or deads and maybe a highland games. Am I stuck being a tall freak that should stick to basketball?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Craig,</p>
<p>Yes, the longer a segment length is, more musculature would need to surround it in order to have similar angles of attachment compared to a shorter segmented lifter. It’s a result of the lever arms in mechanics. However, the repetition continuum still applies to taller guys. A rep range of 8 to 10 would focus on hypertrophy, or muscle growth, while three reps or less would have more of a strength focus. Using 5s is usually a balance between the two. However, if you were to use 8 to 10 reps per set, you are going to limit the amount of weight you can use and also not gain as much strength as you could had you used sets of 5. It may be relevant to use various assistance exercises in that repetition range to grow a group of muscles, but that would apply when the group of muscles will directly augment a more important lift.</p>
<p>An “effective powerlifter” is kind of vague. If someone were going to maximize their mechanical advantage with respect to their segment lengths, then perhaps 300 is a weight that would maximize that, but the discussion is arbitrary. Especially because it doesn’t apply to you. I think you are worried about the wrong things. Continue doing squats and deadlifts, throw in some power snatches, and start throwing. Throwers are typically tall with long limbs because the angle of release results in better throws (read up on angular momentum and consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Track-Field-Biomechanics-2nd/dp/0911521437" target="_blank">buying/reading this book</a> — it’s very good). People would kill to have your height, so don’t be the guy who’s complaining about owning a chest of gold. Take what you have, and do something with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Generic second-hand question from a soldier in Afghanistan:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m curious as to your opinion on additional assistance work that might be considered more “bodybuilding” or “isoloation” style exercises. Things like leg press, calf raises, and flies. Do you think they are a relevant assistance work? What about for an underdeveloped lower body?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Ranger,</p>
<p>Isolation or “bodybuilding” type stuff has its place depending on the program. There are people who support this type of inclusion for the sake of hypertophy and aesthetics, but I know that your job requires more than sitting around (though you comically probably do a bit of that, too). For someone like you, I would simply say, “Squat.” If you squat three times a week for the next 8 weeks, then you’ll see the difference. As you know, squatting has a greater neuroendocrine response that is going to to create an anabolic response of growth much better than the leg press. It isn’t that leg press is bad, it’s just that squatting is so much better.</p>
<p>Plus, given the nature of squatting, it will translate well into moving through rough terrain with a load. Not to mention leg pressing would have more a net anterior force at the knee and could potentially irritate the knee when considering the other activity you are accountable for.</p>
<p>As for building up a lagging body part, whether for muscular size or strength purposes, I always prefer compound free weights. Think RDLs, barbell rows, and weighted pull/chin-ups, and dips. Once those are used regularly, you could utilize more isolation stuff like round back extensions, nosebreakers, french press, or curls.</p>
<p>If you are using each piece consistently for at least one to three months, the trend would be:</p>
<p>Frequency of primary lifts &gt; Compound assistance &gt; Strength-isolation assistance &gt; Sprinkled BB movements</p>
<p>If you’re worried about squatting with respect to your job — some guys are understandably worried that fatiguing their legs could interfere — then I have some second hand information for you. I know some guys from OEF-8 who were in the (in)famous Korengal Valley. That fear existed, yet they trained anyway (though they weren’t squatting 3x/week). Some of the guys would even have races in full kit to get back to the OP — some ungodly climb of 800m or so (the PR was around 17 minutes I believe).</p>
<p>In light of your job, I would say squat. You could always hit up front squats as assistance, but if you’re squatting two or three times a week, you’re gonna see the difference. Just make sure they are deep with your knees out. Don’t even worry about the weight, just make it a bit challenging.</p>

The media acts like the media in that it takes an idea and then turns it into a big ball of fuck. In this article, researchers allowed fat people the option to have sugar-dense (fattening) food in the morning (i.e. cakes, cookies, chocolate, and ice cream) and found that those people lost more weight than the other group. The average American will see this, fist pump, and proceed to continue eating like shit.</p>
<p>There are numerous problems with the news article itself. It points out that the “cakes breakfast” was also “protein enriched”, though it doesn’t indicate any quantified amounts. It doesn’t note if the non-cakes group also focused on “enriching their protein” or not, and if so what the quantified amounts were. Both groups were essentially on a calorie deficit diet, but the emphasis on a balanced breakfast — or having breakfast period — is going to play a major role in metabolizing fat. In other words, the author fucking sucks because they didn’t describe the study well. And if the author was restricted by editors, the editors fucking suck because they are okay with providing a stupid-ass message as a perceived authority. Even if half of the population understands basic science to realize that this article blows (they don’t), that still leaves the other half of the population that is going to say, “Hey, I can eat like shit and lose weight!”</p>

<p>This irritates the shit out of me for several reasons. First, it provides a shortcut. If you’ve been training for a while, you know that there are no shortcuts. To anything. The first line on the back of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1" target="_blank">FIT</a>” says, “Fitness is hard. Very Hard.” Giving people the erroneous impression of ease makes me sick. More often than not, fat people are fat because they do things that make them fat. Poor people are poor because they do things that make them poor. While this isn’t always the case, the belief that it is empowers the individual to actually give a shit.</p>
<p>Second, the food choice itself is a selection of crap that will only cause problems. Eating like shit is going to have shitty consequences; garbage in = garbage out. It must be nice to have the mindset that you can eat whatever you want and not worry about the repercussions of those choices. People who do that are called “lazy” or “mediocre”. It’s not easy to make a choice that’s going to help you recover better, or to have the creativity to find or make the things that can still make you strong and muscular. It’s not easy to make the choices in life that lead to what you want. But if you want to be mediocre, then keep doing mediocre things.</p>
<p>Lastly, the article coddles people and reinforces their shitty behavior. The little shit dog is barking incessantly at others? Pick it up in your arms and soothe it. The kid whines about not getting their way? Hug them and console them. The fat person wants to lose fat but not at any real expense? Tell them they can eat fucking cake for breakfast. CAKE! Literally eating a big-ass cookie for breakfast! Positions of perceived authority shouldn’t reinforce negative behavior because it results in a sub-par follower.</p>
<p>This is what we’re up against. The world wants to make things easier. Ease reduces sacrifice, but sacrifice is the thing that makes us better. Sacrifice is necessary to be great, and being great is the maximization of your potential. If you truly want to achieve what you’re capable of, then ignore shortcuts, consider the consequences of your actions, and don’t coddle your feelings. It’s not always easy, but neither is lifting weights.</p>

  <p>With the advent of CrossFit, there are now more lifting coaches than ever. Fantastic! More people to discuss mechanics and anatomy with is never a bad thing for me. However, 70’s Big hasn’t spent a lot of time discussing coaching despite my interest in it — this will change. I’ve been helping people lift since I was 14. As a leader on a football team, I took initiative to help improve mechanics. Over the years I was consistently bombarded with questions on nutrition, programming, and then started personal training in 2007. In early 2008 I started doing CF and passed the test for the Level 2 certification later that year. Since then I’ve developed my coaching into what some of you have seen today. I’ve taken 120 pound kids and made them strong 170 pound kids. I’ve taken Chris from a broken shoulder and a mid 400s deadlift to a 400 pound bench and almost a 700 pound deadlift. I’ve taken women and gotten them stronger and decreased their body fat. I’m good at what I do, and I’m sure as hell a better coach than a lifter. There are hundreds of aspects to good coaching, and today we will focus on a simple overall methodology: brevity.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>CrossFit has increased the number of coaches in the world significantly, and many of them come from non-coaching backgrounds. This may be one of the reasons that a trend in CF coaches is that they are long-winded and wordy. A few reasons that cause Faulkner-esque coaching include group classes, “explaining it all”, and a lack of a triage.</p>
<p>CrossFit inherently consists of groups. There is a group leader getting the group to learn and move a specific way. Often there are attendees with very different skill levels that the instructor needs to worry about. Furthermore, the instructor — who is very passionate — aims to try and explain every aspect of the movement. The instructor very much wants each person in the group to understand it the same way that they do. This often leads to sensory overload, especially with less experienced trainees. Instead, aim to triage what you’re coaching: what’s the one or two most important aspects of what I’m trying to teach?</p>
<p>Instead of explaining how to un-rack the bar, how to walk it out, and how to set up, just have the trainee do it. Besides, you should be teaching them to do it with an unloaded bar anyway, so these frivolous details can be taught later. <strong>The approach to teaching a movement should be as brief and concise as possible while teaching the most important aspects of the movement</strong>. Stop and consider each movement. Why are you using this movement in your training? Does it use a lot of musculature to use a lot of energy during conditioning? Is it to make the hips and legs strong? Now consider what cues are necessary to accomplish that goal and help the trainee grade out at a “B” with their technique. If the list is long, only select the top two. Does your teaching method focus on those two things? If not, how will you trim it to do so?</p>
<p>The teaching method is important since it initially establishes how quickly (or not) the trainee will perform a given movement. However, the cuing that occurs on a day-to-day basis is equally, if not more, important. <strong>Cues are short reminders to the trainee to do something during a movement to make it better</strong>. It’s okay to explain the concept in detail, however the concept needs to be immediately whittled down to a cue. Shoving the knees out while doing any squat will avoid hip impingement and ensure that the body’s force is more evenly distributed throughout the thighs and hips, but the cue only needs to be “knees out”. Furthermore, the cuing for a squat shouldn’t be, “big breath, chest up, knees out, bounce” (among others). Instead, <strong>focus on one or two of the most important that are going to elicit success on the next set</strong>. If needed, reinforce those same cues at appropriate times during the set. Note that introducing separate cues during the set will typically be unhelpful and usually make the movement worse. Freestyle cuing should only occur with experienced lifters who have received that cue numerous times in the past.</p>
<p>After the set the coach should mentally evaluate how well the lifter performed the two cues that were established prior to the set. If one of the cues became routine or automatic, it can be dropped from the “active cue” list and the coach can focus on the other established cue or a new cue. However, if the single remaining cue is still an ugly fault, the coach shouldn’t introduce a new cue; more variables in the equation results in sensory overload.</p>
<p>Lastly, the coach should have a primary goal for their lifter(s) in a given movement during a session; it should be relative to to the lifter’s skill. For example, when I teach the power clean in the workshops, I aim for each attendee to a) jump the weight up properly and b) rack it properly. While “jumping” may not be a good advanced weightlifting concept, most attendees are using the power clean for general strength and conditioning purposes (aiming to use the power clean for loaded power development). And even if they weren’t, getting their bodies to move a weight because their legs and hips did it instead of their arms is an important concept.</p>
<p>A specific example is Lisa from this past weekend. As I say in the video description, she was unable to go through the standard teaching progression very well. She was arm pulling (the worst habit to have in the clean or snatch), donkey kicking, and not jumping very well (she would remain in hip flexion). Essentially it was an uncoordinated mess because she had too many variables in her head. Instead, I just simplified it to “crayola style” and helped her develop an okay power clean. (Read the info of the video)</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HH56ljnmEs" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>No, there’s not anything special in this video. It was recorded because Lisa was interested in how her movement looked. I don’t typically stand 10 feet away, hold a camera at waist level, and coach through the viewing screen of a video camera, so my method of cuing is a bit bland here, but the point was to cue very simple things for Lisa to do in a simple progression to get her to emulate the two primary principles in the power clean (explained above).</p>
<p>If I had gone up to her and explained every deficiency in her movement, then her confidence would have dropped and she would have had many variables to consider instead of one or two. Instead of saying, “Don’t donkey kick or pull your heels up,” when jumping, the result would have been different than having her do something that eliminates the fault to begin with.</p>
<p>Whether you are coaching a beginner or a regular trainee, it’s unnecessary for each cue to comprehensively address everything in the movement pattern. Instead, be concise and brief. Your brevity should focus on the things that have the greatest impact on the success of the movement. Focus on or two cues that actively tell the lifter to do something. When you do it right, the cues address the conceptual explanation that you have already established (even if the explanation occurred two minutes prior). As the number of trainees increase, keep your goals and cues even more concise. If one attendee is excelling, then you can cue them individually for the next point of emphasis…as long as it’s done with brevity.</p>

  <p><em>Monday’s are devoted to female related topics to help females begin or continue to train.</em></p>
<p>[poll id=”38″]</p>
<p>There were several ladies at the workshop this weekend and they had a large range of experience in lifting. This means that they have different needs when it comes to coaching. Coaching is the ability to communicate with a trainee in order to get them to succeed. I purposely leave the definition a bit vague because I don’t think coaching is only limited to merely achieving desired mechanics.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/02/girls-Copy.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6368" data-permalink="/blog/2012/02/coaching-females/sony-dsc-2/" data-orig-file="/2012/02/girls.jpg" data-orig-size="368,245" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NEX-5&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1329565947&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;18&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;800&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;SONY DSC&quot;}" data-image-title="SONY DSC" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/02/girls.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/02/girls.jpg" src="/2012/02/girls.jpg" alt="" title="SONY DSC" width="368" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6368" /></a></p>
<p>The interpersonal relationship with the trainee is important; how they are treated and how they interact with the coach will have an effect on their success. In my case, I shift roles depending on my audience. I alter my diction, tone, and choice of words based on the synthesis of information I have received from the person. Sometimes this information is a result of them answering my questions, but it’s also dependent how I passively read their body language and personality. I get a feel for their understanding of the material, their education level, and quickly learn how optimally they receive and understand information. All of this, of course, isn’t perfect all of the time, but it’s what is going through my head.</p>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>In the case of the women at this past weekend’s workshop, some of them only needed brief conceptual explanations with some specific cues and they could use their kinesthetic sense to make it happen. Others required further break down of the steps to simplify gross movement patterns into simple actions that their body could easily understand. It’s not that this kind of stuff doesn’t occur with males (because it does), it’s just that the percentage of females that come from a lifting background is lower than males.</p>
<p>When in doubt, things should be kept as simple as possible. One or two simple goals can be set for each training session. If those goals are met, then correct the next fault in the triage. However, if the third improvement causes the primary goals to regress, then cut it out and return to the original plan. Guys who lift regularly have a tendency to try to explain movements when a girl is unable to perform it properly. Explanations may be relevant, but if they occur they need to be whittled down into one, maybe two things to think about when lifting. This goes for all trainees, but especially girls without a lot of lifting experience.</p>
<p>I’m interested in the results of the poll above as it will give a break down of 70’s Big readers and their involvement with female trainees. If a large percentage are females who receive coaching, then I can focus these posts on “doing” rather than “teaching”. Feel free to ask questions or suggest further topics related to female training for future posts. I’m also working on some stuff that includes the help from another female coach/trainee, so stay tuned for that.</p>

  <p>If nothing else, say 70’s Big is thankful.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a formal thank you to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/crossfitannandale/5979958708/" target="_blank">Jeremy</a>, Phuong, and Courtney of <a href="http://www.crossfitannandale.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Anandale</a> for, in no particular order, helping to set up and host the workshop, showing me around D.C., entertaining me with food, drink, and good company, and allowing everyone (including the attendees) to have a great time. They are now some of my favorite people, worthy of drinking with at the mead halls in Tamriel.</p>
<p>Thanks to the attendees for being a good crew and asking great questions. It was a pleasure and I hope you all have fun.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rudy and Laura from <a href="http://outlawcrossfit.com/" target="_blank">Outlaw CrossFit</a> for letting me train at their gym. We also had a compelling interview that can be seen <a href="http://outlawcoach.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/120218/" target="_blank">HERE</a> on Rudy’s blog. It also includes me doing a weak-ass clean and jerk, the heaviest since “the Movember incident”. Also, check out Rudy’s programming; he makes some strong mother truckers over there.</p>

  <h2 id="the-holy-barbell">THE HOLY BARBELL</h2>
<p><em>by Australian coach Peter Upham</em></p>
<p>(The Strength Coach)</p>
<p>“All rise.</p>
<p>Open your hymn books to page 69 and we shall all sing ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhl5K0mTSKY" target="_blank">Pump Iron</a>’.</p>
<p>“Please be seated.</p>
<p>“A few announcements before today’s sermon; we’re praying today for a few of the missionaries that we sponsor, you all remember Ross and Nicole Livingston,……. well as some of you know, they’re in Uganda and they’ve started up the Ugandan Powerlifting Federation and that is an AFPF affiliate. They’re doing really well and having their first raw comp this weekend so we pray that that goes well. They’re a Barbell based gym and they’re doing their comps the right way, Raw is belt and knee wraps only; No elbows sleeves! As it is written in the Technical Manual.</p>
<p>“We’re also praying for Daniel Secombe today, as he embarks next week on an outreach program in the local strongman community. Daniel is hoping to talk to different strongman athletes about the Holy Barbell and will be inviting them along to a special service we are having next week where they can come and talk about the Barbell, ask some questions, and just get to know Strength the same way that we all do, so Outreach Week is going to be a great opportunity for this gym to see some new faces come along in the future.</p>

<p>“At the conclusion of today’s sermon, our Sunday School kids will be moving off to a special day we have planned for them. Our local Federation Commissioner will be holding a special question and answer session that we’ve been promoting where they can get answers to some of those challenging questions, that I know as a parent of 2 young ones myself, are sometimes hard to answer.</p>
<p>“Today’s sermon for the congregation is about injuries. The Technical Manual reading will come today from page 3 and Tracy is going to read for us.</p>
<p>(Tracy)</p>
<p>“…. Verse 17. To Adam the Strength Spirit said, “Because you have listened to your wife and eaten the fruit from the tree of which I said ‘do not eat’,</p>
<p>“Cursed is the gym floor because of you;</p>
<p>endlessly will you sweep chalk.</p>
<p>Through painful toil will you eat food to bulk up.</p>
<p>Eating will produce flatulence and painful bowel movements.</p>
<p>By the sweat of your brow will you toil on the barbell,</p>
<p>Injured will your training history be,</p>
<p>until you return to the chalk, because from it you were taken</p>
<p>And to it you will return.”</p>
<p>“This is the word of the Strength,”</p>
<p>(ALL) “Praise be to Strength”.</p>

</p>
<p>(Strength Coach)</p>
<p>“We know that man is imperfect. But the Technical Manual tells us that when Strength first created the Heavens and the Earth it was made perfect. Injuries we know were only possible after the Fall, when man first turned his back on Strength and started to try to place agility and endurance and power on the same footing with Strength; in fact, there’s still many people in this world who still think that,….. mostly in places like India, they’re called polyathletests.</p>
<p>“Injuries are the penalty and price that we pay for disobeying Strength and trying to do things our own way. If we would just listen to the Strength Spirit’s word that he hath given us through the Technical Manual then we wouldn’t get injured so much.</p>
<p>“This week when you go out into the community to your regular jobs and you’re mixing with others, think about your opportunity to spread the word of Strength, the Technical Manual says when Strength came to Earth a Man it says in the Book of Arthur Saxon….</p>
<p>“Go back and report to John what you hear and see: The slow speeded up, the crippled walk, those with cancer in remission, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.”</p>
<p>“So the Technical Manual has a mandate for preaching the word of Strength, it’s a call to spread the Good News that Strength will rise again and take its proper place.”</p>

<p>Later in Sunday School…….</p>
<p>(Gym Sunday School teacher, Miss Conners)</p>
<p>“Children, Mr Eccels is here today to answer your questions just like we talked about last week, what I thought I might do is ask the first question and then anyone can ask a question after that. Mr Eccles is our Federation Commissioner.</p>
<p>“So, Mr Eccles, I’ve been hearing a lot lately about how dangerous commercial fitness is and bodybuilding, what can you tell us about what those people believe?”</p>
<p>(Federation Commissioner Eccles)</p>
<p>“Well that’s a good question. There’s a lots of information out there about Bodybuilding. They prey to the Prophet Joe Weider, they believe in Strength but their Technical Manual is different, they don’t test strength and you know they don’t teach the same things that we do about women. They put women in their own competitions and they can’t compete against the men like we do with the co-efficients that the Technical Manual gives us. I just think that’s wrong.”</p>
<p>(Little Jimmy)</p>
<p>“How do we know that the Technical Manuel is true?”</p>
<p>(Eccles)</p>
<p>“Well the Technical Manual was given to us by the Strength Spirit so we know that its true. The Technical Manual says that the Technical Manual is true, so we can have faith in it.”</p>
<p>(Little Johnny)</p>
<p>“What’s Crossfit?”</p>
<p>(Eccles)</p>
<p>“Crossfit does a lot of things different to us, we’re Powerlifters, Crossfit is just a new fancy thing that has started up; they have good marketing, I hear that Tom Cruise is a member, and it’s a lot about personality and flashiness. It looks like a bit of a money making scheme to me. A lot of people end up leaving or try to leave and there’s a lot of phony friendships that break down. They sometimes try to do what we do. They don’t even have a Technical Manual, and the guy who started it used to write Science Fiction (laughing) so how can you believe in that?!!”</p>
<p>(Big Jimmy)</p>
<p>“Some new people moved into the house up the street from me and my brother, they go to an IWF school. Is it true that they’re not taught the right Technical Manual?”</p>
<p>(Little Johnny)</p>
<p>“They’re weird, they don’t even bench!”</p>
<p>(Little Sally)</p>
<p>“Yeah, and they don’t deadlift and they squat high bar!”</p>
<p>(Big Jimmy)</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>(Little Johnny)</p>
<p>“Yeah is that true?”</p>
<p>(Eccles)</p>
<p>“If you look in the first few chapters of the Technical Manual it talks about the Strength Spirit’s chosen people and how they used to believe, but they kept turning their back on Strength and trying to do things their own way. Then in 1972 they angered Strength by taking away the Press from competition and they’ve been cursed ever since.</p>
<p>“Now there’s a lot of nice people in IWF gyms I’ve even had them come to our gym and they train in their own way but we just think they’re wrong about a few things and remember, the Technical Manual says, ‘Judge not or yee be judged’, so its between the Strength Spirit and the individual. Also they have a President who they listen to and think that he is some sort of intermediary between themselves and Strength, and we obviously think that’s wrong. At the moment their President is in a lot of trouble for moving on some people from one gym to another who were doing some bad things with steroids. Those people are sick in the head and they went on to re-offend.”</p>
<p>(Big Jimmy)</p>
<p>“Is it an abomination for two people of the same sex to spot each other no-homo-style on the squat?”</p>
<p>(Eccles)</p>
<p>“Yes, the Technical Manuel is very specific about that, it’s an abomination. I don’t care what you see on television or the internet these days.”</p>
<p>(Sally)</p>
<p>“What’s a schism?”</p>
<p>(Eccles)</p>
<p>“Well that’s a big word, where did you hear that?”</p>
<p>(Sally)</p>
<p>“I heard my parents talking about it.”</p>
<p>(Eccles)</p>
<p>“A schism sometimes happens if people aren’t teaching things from the Technical Manual or they think they can write their own Technical Manual.</p>
<p>(Taps at his AFPF ‘Another Fucking Powerlifting Federation’ logo on his shirt)</p>
<p>“See we’re AFPF lifters at this gym, that’s the pure strain of Strength (makes gesture with hand drawing a line straight down). We follow strictly what the Technical Manual says.”</p>

  <p>Check out <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/" target="_blank">this really cool article</a> called “Instinctive sleeping and resting postures: an anthropological and zoological approach to treatment of low back and joint pain”. Be sure to read the actual article in addition to looking at the <del datetime="2012-02-15T05:44:33+00:00">awkward</del> pictures. It’s fascinating.</p>
<p>After yesterday’s post highlighting the benefits of a quality diet, and today’s post focused on how resting postures can improve or prevent joint problems, some readers are thinking, “What the hell? Is he gonna live in a cave next?” Well, if I had a choice, <a href="http://www.northernutahhomesearch.com/fine/real/estate/home_view/1064296/mlsname/WFRMLS" target="_blank">I’d live in this quaint cabin</a>. Here’s the deal: I’m obsessed with efficiency. When I was in school, I wanted to learn about the human body so I could improve it. When I started coaching, I wanted to learn how to best move the body with respect to mechanics and anatomy. When I started learning about training, I wanted to know how to optimally train the body. I constantly aim to have optimal technique in any athletic movement whether it’s lifting, shooting a gun, swimming, running, or agilely moving when playing pick-up volleyball. When I am cleaning up around the house, I think of the most efficient method to do each chore so that I don’t waste movement or time walking back and forth. So when there is clearly a dietary method that can improve the efficiency of the human body AND it can be tweaked to use for lifters, then I’m going to use it. It results in recovering more efficiently, but it also results in increasing the potential for long-term health. Like Rob Lowe, I want to live until I’m 150.</p>
<p>So when I see a physiotherapist who has spent many years around tribal and zoological populations, and he observes constants in how they rest, I consider that information relevant. I don’t take it for granted when the physiotherapist says that tribal populations simply don’t have many musculoskeletal problems. I deem that highly relevant. In the same way that a series of adaptations resulted in the evolution of various species, they have adapted to using particular methods of rest that prevent getting gunked up hips, knees, backs, and shoulders. I’m an anatomy and physiology nerd because it helps you and me get better.</p>
<p>Think about it: were our “ancestors” sitting hunched over in chairs on a regular basis? Even if we disregard the “this is how we evolved argument” (which is entirely valid and relevant), we can still observe the lack of joint issues in “tribal populations”. For example, what we call the “paleo squat” is observed by Tetley in this article and “can be very helpful in treating backs”, particularly in opening up the sacro-iliac joint and lumbar region.</p>
