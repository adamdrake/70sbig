  <p>Are you unhappy with how you look? Do you look in the mirror wishing you had a muscular physique instead of a portly disposition? Are you unhappy with your performance? Do you want to still train into old age? These are legitimate concerns that you are okay to have. Surprisingly the “online strength training communities” seem to have a disdain for “healthy eating”, yet have a respect for strong guys who are also jacked. It’s quite possible to achieve, but it takes effort.</p>

    This won't make you jacked

<p><strong>Group Think</strong></p>
<p>Everyone knows that in order to grow, you need to eat. There’s an understanding that calories are required to get larger muscles, but that concept has been taken to the extreme. The problem arises from very skinny guys shouting, “I cannot grow, my metabolism is too fast!” That garners the response of larger men to say, “You <em>can</em> grow if you would just eat. I bet you’d grow if you drank a gallon of milk a day.” If the skinny guy actually drank a gallon milk, he, of course, would grow. In truth, the skinny guy is not accustomed to an eating regimen that puts enough food into his body; mechanically he cannot handle the volume due to an adaptation of not eating a lot (he wouldn’t be skinny if he ate a lot). The short term answer is to acquire liquid calories since it’s mechanically easy to consume. Milk is full of calories balanced across the macronutrients and is nature’s growth food.</p>
<p>This mindset of acquiring calories flourishes to include any calorie-dense food. However, calorie-dense foods are often not the healthiest choices. They are full of carbohydrates, sodium, and artificial chemicals that have a ravaging effect on hormones and encourage inflammation. A diet with high calories and low quality will eventually result in being out of shape. This doesn’t mean that “dirty meals” (like fast food, pancakes, ice cream, etc.) don’t have a place. I’ve written how dirty meals can be used <a href="/blog/2011/07/eating-like-an-asshole/" target="_blank">in preparation of very heavy training sessions</a> and these meals can even be used to help aid recovery. However, they shouldn’t be a staple in the diet.</p>
<p>This “eat to succeed” mindset permeates to the point where of pride. Anyone eating healthy or caring about how they look is mocked. But why should they be? Is it wrong to want to look powerful in healthy in addition to being strong? Don’t we all respect jacked lifters like Klokov, Konstantinovs, and John Kuc (steroids notwithstanding)? When a reader of this site forgoes their body image in the pursuit of strength, I know that they have succumbed to the “internet peer pressure” to not give a shit. And that’s unfortunate. Johnny Pain <a href="/blog/2011/08/swole/" target="_blank">actively puts out a message</a> that it’s okay to be concerned with how you look. I agree, especially because this website started as a result of the admiration for jacked lifters in the ’70s. No other person should have a bearing on what makes you happy or what your goals are. They may think it’s weird, but they should still clap you on the back and say, “Yeah man, whatever you wanna do.”</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to improve aesthetics and body fat levels are to simply eat better quality food. Are you eating sandwiches, cereal, waffles, granola bars, fast food, and processed food items on a daily basis? It’s possible to get similar macronutrient quantities with better quality food. “Quality food” includes any type of meat and eggs, potatoes, butter, vegetables, nuts/seeds, and fruit. Note that meat is plentiful, frequent, and necessary. While a Paleo focus would alter the quantity of some of those side items (to improve on Omega 3 and 6 ratios and limit fructose), eating these higher quality foods will be better than bad quality foods. This shouldn’t be surprising since whole, natural foods will obviously have more nutrients and less chemicals than the processed alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Inflammation</strong></p>
<p>Bad quality foods typically don’t digest well, cause irritation in the gut, and will typically contribute to systemic inflammation. Gut irritation essentially means that the intestinal lining is destroyed resulting in an “inflamed gut”. Some foods can even create perforations in the intestinal wall resulting in a “leaky gut”. Either way it inflames the area — which automatically increases the systemic inflammation — and doesn’t absorb nutrients efficiently. Since the body is trying to heal the inflamed gut, it doesn’t heal other non-gut things very well either. Overall, this contributes to further inflammation since other stresses don’t have the full “recovery capability” of the system. This means that recovery is slower for stress, whether the stress is from training or illness.</p>
<p>Said in another way, eating crappy food develops systemic inflammation. This depresses the system to a point where it is at a deficit and can’t handle other stresses as well. Therefore, if you eat higher quality foods, then you can avoid this mishap and ensure that you are optimally recovering from training. Optimally recovering from training is important for getting stronger, but also for developing muscles.</p>
<p><strong>Strength and Muscles</strong></p>
<p>As you grasp your training partners meaty grips in your man crusher, you will say, “Strength and muscles, brother.” It’s what it’s all about. But can you get strong and jacked on a a diet that accounts for aesthetics and inflammation?</p>
<p>The answer is “Yeah buddy.” I pretty much eat a paleo diet, but occasionally eat a double bacon cheese burger. I can do an “updated food log” soon, but the diet should revolve around the <a href="/blog/2010/06/making-the-cut/" target="_blank">Grandma Principles</a> and “meat and potatoes”. Eat real food: tons of meat, potatoes, vegetables, and some fruit. Eat fattier cuts of meat to get necessary fat calories and ensure that <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">protein levels</a> are conducive to strength training or body fat loss (note that more protein is necessary when losing body fat). Eggs are a wonderful source of protein and fat. Eat some vegetables for nutrients on top of a multi-vitamin, and have some fruit. The bulk of the carbs should come from the potatoes. The vegetables are primarily for ruffage/fiber and fruit is nice because it’s tasty. Your goals will vary some details of this eating style like quantity of macronutrients and timing of carbohydrates.</p>

    It's possible to be a serious lifter and follow paleo guidelines
  </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Preferences</strong></p>
<p>I prefer beef or pork since they carry fat calories. I make ground beef, burger patties (also ground), steak occasionally, pork loin, and ribs. We also make chili regularly. Currently I don’t eat “grass fed” because of the lack of availability, but grass fed meat products would improve the Omega 3 ratio to result in decreasing inflammation. Fish oil is important in that it can give you Omega 3’s to change the ratio with respect to Omega 6’s, and that’s why we suggest ingesting it.</p>
<p>I prefer sweet potatoes because I think that they taste better than white potatoes; the sweet variation is also preferable to fat guys as the glycemic index is lower (the only nutrient difference between sweet and white potatoes is that sweet potatoes have carotene and vitamin A, otherwise they are pretty similar).</p>
<p>I use butter to garner more calories on my potatoes, and will sometimes eat peanut butter, almond butter, or olive oil for extra calories if I’m not hungry or don’t have time (the peanut/almond stuff has higher Omega 6s, so I’ve actually been limiting them). The nut butters are usually eaten with dark chocolate (90% cocoa). I also supplement whey protein daily because it’s easy, effective, and cost efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong></p>
<p>As a result of reducing overall inflammation, the body operates more efficiently. Practically speaking, this means that you will recovery better. But it also means you are healthier. Controlling inflammation from within will make for an optimally acting body that doesn’t have hormones out of whack. It’s also possible to support strength training with a high quality diet, but care will have to be given into how that occurs. For serious trainees — like nationally or internationally competitive lifters and athletes — how they conduct their eating will matter more. They may even require additional calories in the form of “non quality meals” (consider Michael Phelps), but the majority of readers on this site are not at such a level. If you have a normal job instead of training as a job, then you probably don’t apply.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>It’s okay to care about your health and how you look. Personally, I’ve never wanted to be flabby or out of shape and intend to lift and have an active life deep into old age. Instead of eating “just to take in calories”, aim to eat in a way that establishes those calories with higher quality foods so that you can a) meet the macro requirements but also b) improve your body composition, c) reduce systemic inflammation, and subsequently d) recovery better and be healthier. It’s possible to apply a Paleo concept to a lifter’s goals and lifestlye. Do so by eating lots of meat, potatoes, and other high quality foods. When you splurge, limit how and when for optimal results.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2011/08/improving-diet/" target="_blank">This post</a> can help you get started on a road to higher quality food, but I aim to talk about this in the future. You’ll notice that some of the concepts in this post contradict some older posts (i.e. 2+ years ago) of 70’s Big. If I stayed ingrained in an single belief and didn’t try to make you as strong, jacked, and healthy as possible then I’m just a negligent asshole. Dietary guidelines have shifted and improved over time, otherwise most of the content still applies.</p>

  <p>Jake Briskin has asked me several times to do a post on Marilyn Monroe. I think the real reason is because he has a fetish with “black and white” realities. Sorry, Jake, the world is full of color.</p>

<p>Marilyn Monroe was one of the first sex icons in modern American culture. It’s been said that she was a “tomboy” when growing up because she liked to run around with the boys and compete. She ran, swam, and played softball. However, later in life she established two unconventional habits: she exercised with weights and ate a “high protein” diet.</p>

<p>She also has steak, lamb chops, or liver with carrots in the evening. She also points out her ice cream habit that wouldn’t be possible if her regular diet wasn’t “composed of almost totally protein foods”. It seemed so crazy at the time, but this is a great diet philosophy: high protein and fat with vegetables and fruit. Every now and then treat yourself to a splurge, but keep it under control. Exercise or train often. Marilyn Monroe was onto something good, and it wasn’t just JFK.</p>

  <p>Did you have a good week?</p>
<p>Yes – Post the PR, cause it’s <strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>No – Update us on why you have failed.</p>
<p>Some things I read this week:</p>
<p><a href="/shrugthug/" target="_blank">I got updated on Brent’s tlog.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://alongthelinesof.com/" target="_blank">I also got updated on Ben’s tlog</a>. I hereby start a petition that requires Ben to upload one sketch each week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ravnskov.nu/myth1.htm" target="_blank">This doctor is really good</a> at simplifying science to understand why cholesterol levels are used inappropriately by your medical doctor (just one page of many).</p>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/is-honey-a-safer-sweetener/#axzz1lvAFe0Bf" target="_blank">post about how honey is a bit better than standard sugar</a>, which reminds me that <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-definitive-guide-to-sugar/" target="_blank">this sugar post</a> was top shelf.</p>
<p>The 70’s Big week started with a female post describing how certain exercises require a good <a href="/blog/2012/02/contraction-vs-moving-weight/" target="_blank">“contraction of the muscles”</a> instead of merely moving weight, yet the post is relevant to guys too. On Tuesday I cleared up that <a href="/blog/2012/02/does-70s-big-hate-crossfit/" target="_blank">I don’t hate CrossFit</a> because some people thought I did (though I obviously disagree with some things). The truth is I just don’t give too much of a damn what other people do and disliking someone for their training philosophy is just being a dickhead. Disliking someone (a bro) for walking in front of you is also being a dickhead. On Wednesday we <a href="/blog/2012/02/ricky-bruch-inducted-to-hof/" target="_blank">inducted Ricky Bruch into the 70’s Big Hall of Fame</a>. Thursday I told the story of how Sid Bream did the unthinkable and asked if <a href="/blog/2012/02/where-were-you/" target="_blank">you could live with yourself </a>if you missed Donny Shankle’s shot at making the Olympic team (but also good luck to Chad Vaughn and Kendrick Farris).</p>

<p>And onward to the Q&amp;A. Remember, I do these to clear up any questions or concerns you guys have with the week of posts. I legitimately want you to understand why I give certain pieces of advice, and it’s okay to question what I say. If what I say is proved with physics or physiological-esque objective analysis, then know that it’s not just my opinion. If what I say contradicts something else and you want clarification, then ask away. If you want to know more or challenge my opinion, ask away. If I can’t answer, then I’ll try to find someone smarter than me who can. Everyone remember: I’m not the guy that gets pissed when you question his teachings.</p>

<p>Justin. What about palms up pendlay rows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear 70smediumbryce,</p>
<p>That’s a fucking hilarious name; well done. Supinated (underhand) grip rows are definitely doable, though I haven’t used them. The angle of the humerus will be slightly different due to the enhanced shoulder external rotation. Something tells me that they wouldn’t be able to be done as heavy as regular “Pendlay rows” off of the floor. I have half a mind to say that they would be really good for developing musculature to support external shoulder rotation, but the regular pronated grip will be superior for strength gains. If anyone uses these, let us know what you think (especially in comparison to the regular grip).</p>

<p>Since you are blogging away about high/low bar squatting, any chance you can tackle “bouncing in the bottom of the squat”, vs “pausing at the bottom”? Pros and cons, etc? I’d just like to read your take on it is all. Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear guy,</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of paused squats since squats of any kind are dependent on a stretch reflex out of the bottom. Whether you’re a single ply powerlifter, a raw powerlifter, or a weightlifter recovering from a clean, the stretch reflex is important (Note: multi-ply training will be different and out of my forte). The low bar stretches and contracts mostly on the the hamstrings while the high or front squats will do so off of the glutes, upper hamstrings, and quads. Paused squats and box squats aren’t in any of my programming. They may have value for advanced lifters, but I don’t see myself programming them since it will only alter the necessary physiological processes to make a good squat. Also, if you remove the stretch reflex then you can’t lift as much weight in the squat and lose that effective neuromuscular training adaptation that transfers into other sports so well. Losing the efficacy and using less weight reduce the effectiveness of the exercise overall, therefore average strength trainees will waste their time in doing paused squats.</p>

<p>Justin about RDL loading. Do you continue to add weight each week or just get up to a reasonable weight and leave it there? </p>
(I left that part where he bitches out Brian because I thought it was funny.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear oldmansquatting,</p>
<p>Typically you would have started fairly light (to ensure the proper muscular work) and steadily increased over time. If you approach a weight in which you cannot maintain the lumbar position (which would result in slack hamstrings), then that weight is on the cusp of “too heavy”. A year from now we can worry about pushing the weight up for “strength purposes”, but getting proper muscular action is what will make you stronger now. Still, you could put on at least five pounds a week, but ten pounds is probably better. Like with most things, the jumps will decrease as the work set weight gets higher relative to your strength.</p>
<p>You can also gauge progression on “soreness factor”. RDLs can cause near crippling soreness, something that can be debilitating to subsequent training sessions in the week. I don’t think you should go high enough to wreck your hamstrings and ruin the next workout. I’ve kept my weight constant for several workouts to account for this. Training shouldn’t destroy the body, especially if it destroys the next session’s efficacy.</p>

<p>well-written post, Justin, I just have one concern. I thought more weight=more muscle, regardless of form (to an extent). back when I did BBing stuff I remember reading that Arnold did cheat curls fairly often, and it’s obvious that you can move significantly more weight while cheat curling. also, this is anecdotal, but there’s at least a few guys at every globo-gym who are fucking HUGE but do half, cheated, or force reps with just about every exercise. also, kroc rows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>i’m not trying to prove you wrong or disagree with you as I don’t have any factual evidence myself, i’m just curious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear mattciupak,</p>
<p>Everyone remember: I’m not the guy that gets pissed when you question his teachings. You don’t have to tip-toe around the sensitivity of questioning me, though I appreciate your concern.</p>
<p>You are correct in that progressive overload is necessary for strength increases, but also hypertrophy. The latter is the case since if you can lift more weight for more reps, you’ll be “more big” than had you not had the strength to use that weight.</p>
<p>Cheated exercises like cheat curls or “kroc rows” are very specific methods to put more stress on the related exercise. I would argue that Matt Kroc cannot improve his range of motion due to the size of the dumbbell. You could argue <a href="http://youtu.be/WEwH2SPxv6k" target="_blank">that I do “kroc rows” here</a>, but notice that I go through a full ROM with a little assistance out of the bottom due to my leg assistance.</p>
<p>More importantly than debating each movement, we must understand <em>why</em> we would use a given movement in a program. In someone who has a lack of musculature in their upper back and shoulders, doing cheated pull-downs would a) alter the mechanics so that the targeted muscles aren’t moving the apparatus, b) not work the muscle through a full range of motion, and c) not get quality work in that muscle. I want and need the muscle to develop — a term that would imply muscular growth and strength increase — in order to improve it’s use in more important lifts (like pressing, benching, squatting, deadlifting, etc.). It does so by improving it’s leverage (via growth) and force production ability (via strength increase). All the professionals you see doing “cheated movements” have established strength and musculature where an overload in a partial ROM will help stimulate development. The goober you see in your gym doing cheated ranges of motion is simply copying advanced lifters, a mistake that has been made by ignorant trainees for decades.</p>
<p>Remember that handling the most weight you can with <em>proper mechanics</em> and through a <em>full</em> range of motion is how you will get stronger and train all of the muscles fully. The post I wrote mostly was focused to assistance exercises, especially those designed to develop musculature to improve strength training. Remember that you, unlike Arnold, are not on steroids. And if you were, you don’t train like him anyway (I assume).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people were going back and forth about whether CrossFit was a sport or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s a sport because it doesn’t fit in with having a ‘standardized set of rules’ across all competitions. People will usually cite strongman as something that is “just like CrossFit”, but it’s very different. If you look at the rules of most strongman organization, they have a very specific guideline on how a competition is formed. There are different types of events, like “overhead”, “deadlift”, and “carry”, that have a list of activities that fit within that type of event. The competition selects x amount of certified activities within that type of event to make the competition. The competitors <a href="http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/home/sports-and-events/strongman-classic.html" target="_blank">know what events they will be doing before the event occurs</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, CrossFitters don’t know what the events are until they show up. And even if they did know the events before hand, there isn’t a standardized method of selecting the events. This is the primary thing that removes CrossFit from “sport” classification. And it has nothing to do with me “just not wanting CrossFit to be called a sport”, because I really don’t give a shit. It’s definitely a competition and can be both entertaining and fun, but depending on how “sport” is defined (and there isn’t a good definition”, CF would be left out of this designation.</p>
<p>On a side note, most of the people in the discussion create their definition of a sport based on what they do or do not want to be classified as a sport. That’s something Kim Jong-il would have done.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a question/issue that if you could shed any light on whatsoever it would greatly appreciated: I have 4 dislocated vertebrae/rib heads in my thoracic spine. I’m in the process of having it corrected, but in the mean time I have not been able to train. I had intended to compete again in June and this injury has obviously derailed that somewhat. Is there anything you would suggest for working around an injury of this sort or at the very least how to maintain as much of my strength as possible while I wait to get back into my normal program?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Shellie,</p>
<p>Yikes. The basic answer: do what you can. If the area is really flared up and inflamed around your thoracic spine, than ice it every day, take fish oil, and do your best to mob the areas around it. Can you run <a href="http://youtu.be/eveYJP1indI" target="_blank">five way shoulder</a> well enough? If muscles are tight around those ribs, then it will be harder for them to get fixed. Of course, your chiro or doctor’s opinion trumps mine. If you were my lifter, I’d see what you could do without pain and have you do that. I’d even pursue machines like leg press, machine bench press, and machine overhead press. If something gives you pain, then you should probably avoid it unless it’s a small amount that you don’t think will make the issue worse. I highly suggest you ice it regularly; never before training, but always after (even if mobbing is “training”). Light horizontal rowing could help get some work in the area, but that’s only if the ribs are in the correct spot (think of this as something you do when it’s on it’s way to being more healed compared to when you’re still super tender). You could also do some light band work (doing standard movements with very low resistance). Whatever you do, ice it regularly every day and take fish oil.</p>

  <p>[spoiler show=”Show info about the Arnold Sport Festival”]We’re less than a month out from the <strong>Arnold Sports Festival</strong> (<a href="http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/" target="_blank">site</a>), and I wanted to go over some things. First, quite a few of us from 70’s Big will be in attendance including me, Brent, Chris, Mike, and Mike’s brother Alex (unfortunately AC won’t be able to make it). Second, I hope that many of you come to the event because a) it’s the world’s greatest sport celebration and festival and b) we can meet and hang out. Third, we’ll be staying at the University Plaza hotel. Rooms are getting booked up, but we have a few reserved that we may not need, so we can coordinate that if you wanted to stay at that hotel.</p>
<p>Fourth, there are tons of awesome events to see including professional boxing on Thursday night (we intend to go to that), raw powerlifting on Friday, single ply geared lifting (NAPF/IPF rule) on Saturday, USAW Senior Nationals on Friday and Saturday (doubles as Olympic trials), amateur and professional strongman, arm wrestling, pro deadlift competition on Saturday (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIqkF_B-wY" target="_blank">this is what happens</a>), CrossFit, and some other stuff like fencing, table tennis, and martial arts. This doesn’t even include the expo, which will have hundreds of booths of people trying to sell us mostly stupid stuff with scantily clad women. There may be some interesting products, but my interviews will be more interesting. I really can’t imagine a cooler weekend to round-house kick you in the face.</p>
<p>You are all welcome to hang out or wander around with us. I think the easiest way to stay in touch on what we’re doing is to use Twatter, so I’ll update our happenings there. That way we can share information or plan meet-ups like dinner or bowling. The bowling alley is where I’ll tell you to go if I don’t want to hang out with you: “Yeah, just meet us at the bowling alley at 8. If we’re not there on time, just hang out and we’ll be there.” I hope all of you northeastern readers will get to Columbus so that I can tell you to go to the bowling alley.</p>
<p>Oh, not to mention all of the actual bodybuilding stuff going on. I’ve never seen a bodybuilding show before, and this is the second biggest show of the year in the world. Shawn, Brent, and I got tickets to see that, so that’ll be interesting. Note that some events require ticket purchase, and the expo tickets are pretty cheap (10 to 15 doll hairs). In any case, it’ll be a lot of fun, and I’ll be so excited I’ll be helicoptering my wiener around, like, constantly.</p>
<p>Note that you will want to get expo <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/promo/j4w9k7" target="_blank">tickets</a> before the event. The total cost of the weekend expo pass including fees is $32.55. Otherwise it’ll be at least $13.50 per day. If you’re only going to go to Friday/Saturday expo, then it would be cheaper to get two one-day passes. Note that there is no expo on Thursday.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>I’d like to talk to you about an event on Saturday morning at the Arnold Sport Festival. But first, let’s go back in time.</p>
<ol start="1992">
<li>A leap year designated the “International Space Year” by the UN. A year that included American President George. H.W. Bush vomiting into the lap of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa before fainting at a state dinner in Japan. It was a glorious year; I was six years old. The previous year the Atlanta Braves lost the 1991 World Series to the Minnesota Twins in a season when the went “from worst to first”. They were back in the playoffs in 1992, and it all came down to the final game of the NCLS against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Braves rallied from being down 2-0 in the bottom of the 9th inning of game seven. Things were TIGHT.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fast forward to two outs, with two runners on. David Justice, who is known for banging Halle Berry, was on third, and Sid Bream, who was known for his mustache and being the slowest fucking runner in the universe, much less Major League Baseball, was on second. Bobby fucking Cox brought in another pinch hitter: Francisco Cabrera. Cabrera was in the minor leagues a few months before and had only batted about ten times before this. He was pretty much thinking, “Fuck.” Terry Pendleton, who is known for being a good hitter and having a giant ass, told him to “hit the ball over the short stop”. Apparently Pirates center fielder, Andy Van Slyke, told Barry Bonds, known to be an asshole, to play more shallow in left field. Bonds ignored him because he’s a fucking asshole.</p>
<p>On a 1-2 count, pitcher Stan Belinda, known for what is about to happen, threw a high fastball that Cabrera put over the short stop. Asshole Barry Bonds was too far back to field it, and David Justice easily scored. Then the unthinkable happened. The third base coach waved Sid Bream — the slowest fucking runner in the history of everything — to keep running to home plate. They had nothing to lose since the game was tied.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget what the next few seconds looked like. Sid Bream was running slower than a buried dead body. Seriously, this guy couldn’t beat Stephen Hawking in a foot race. Sid is running, and running…and fucking running. Asshole Barry Bonds’ throw comes into the plate. And Sid slides…AND BEATS THE TAG! THE CROWD AND ANNOUNCER GO APE SHIT! THE ATLANTA BRAVES ARE GOING TO THE WORLD SERIES! HELICOPTER WIENER!</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3WtSKEMUio" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>(<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=3251567" target="_blank">Video</a>)</p>
<p>This event would spark the Atlanta Braves decade long domination in the NL East, and it would also spark the last time the Pittsburgh Pirates ever had a winning season. Barry Bonds is still an asshole.</p>
<p>To this day, people in Atlanta still say, “Where were you when Sid slid?” It was a magical moment for Braves fans. And here is where our story comes full circle. Donny Shankle is set to lift at 10:00 AM on Saturday, March 3rd at the Arnold Sport Festival. Donny has grown into a legend in the small sport of Olympic weightlifting. He has persevered through a decade of training and finally — FINALLY — has a realistic shot at making the Olympic team. This website has directly supported Donny through generous donations that have allowed him to focus all of his efforts into training — and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIvlASEQhww&#038;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">it’s paying off</a>.</p>
<p>Donny has two chances to hit a total that will earn him the one male spot on the US Olympic team. Arguably his best shot is at Nationals since he will travel to Ohio instead of South America for the Pan American Championships a few weeks later. He’ll weigh in at 8 AM, so cutting weight won’t be as bad as lifting later in the day, and he won’t have to eat South American food (known to get lifter’s sick). The Arnold is probably the time that he will hit his qualifying total to go to the Olympics.</p>
<p>When that moment comes, and his bar is loaded to his third, and final, clean and jerk attempt…do you want to miss that moment? When he cleans the weight in his nonchalant style, when he finally dips and drives that bar up…do you want to miss that moment? When he locks the weight out and holds it triumphantly overhead, knowing that he just made the Olympic team — a lifter we as fans have directly supported — DO YOU WANT TO MISS THAT MOMENT?</p>
<p>Besides, you aren’t going to see him lift at the Pan American Championships and you aren’t going to see him lift at the Olympics in London. History will remember that defining moment when Donny Shankle, a respected and seemingly legendary character, hit a clean and jerk to put him into the Olympics. People will say, “Where were you when Shankle hit it?” Hopefully it’s more classy than that, but we will all remember that moment. Where will you be? Will you miss it?</p>

  <p>The 70’s Big Hall of Fame is a way to pay tribute to legendary lifters and athletes. Currently there is no criteria for nominating or selecting candidates, much less criteria for when these processes should occur. I open this topic for discussion; together we will set criteria for growing the ranks of the 70’s Big Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show Hall of Fame rule proposals”]- Lifters must be five years removed from retirement or active lifting. This is a requirement in most professional sport halls of fame. While Klokov’s name has come up quite a bit in nominations (and he has been my favorite lifter for several years), his career is yet to be over.</p>
<p>– Nominees are judged on their performance, their masculinity, their desire or intensity to be successful, and their inspiration. Most halls of fame include a collection of qualities that can’t necessarily be quantified (i.e. everything other than performance). 70’s Big evokes a particular attitude and intensity with respect to striving for success. Our candidates should also have these same qualities.</p>
<p>– Nominees are not judged by their inclusion of “being from the ’70s” or “being big”. Pyrros Dimas, at most an 85kg lifter, is one of my nominees for his tenacity, heart, and results. 70’s Big isn’t “being big for the sake of being big”, and that criteria isn’t relevant to nominees.</p>
<p>– Electors will include the entire readership of 70’s Big as opposed to a select group (like the NFL and MLB).</p>
<p>– Nominees will be inducted four times a year, every three months. March, June, September, and December would be inductee months. This is one item that should be most debated. Perhaps three inductees a year is more appropriate?</p>
<p>– In the two months preceding the induction month, there will be secondary and primary vote-offs (polls that run throughout the month). These polls will eliminate the total nominees to narrow the choices down.</p>
<p>– The number of nominees is debatable. Should 20 nominees be selected for secondary voting? Then 10 for primary? Then 5 for induction?</p>
<p>– There will be a final vote during induction month (with set dates, perhaps the 1st to the 14th days of the month).</p>
<p>– If still alive, 70’s Big will attempt to contact the athlete for an interview or to send a letter of thanks with a token of our gratitude.</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p>Today it is my honor and pleasure to induct Swedish discus thrower Ricky Bruch posthumously into the 70’s Big Hall of Fame. Ricky Bruch had man battles throughout his life, yet he passed away on May 30, 2011 after his toughest battle, pancreatic cancer. He was 64.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6290" data-permalink="/blog/2012/02/ricky-bruch-inducted-to-hof/ricky-bruch-2/" data-orig-file="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg" data-orig-size="350,249" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Ricky Bruch" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg" src="/2012/02/Ricky-Bruch.jpg" alt="" title="Ricky Bruch" width="350" height="249" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6290" /></a></p>
<p>Björn Rickard “Ricky” Bruch was an exceptional athlete, but failed to achieve the highest gold medal honors in international competition. Bruch placed 8th in the 1968 Olympic games in Mexico City with a discus throw of 59.28m. He won a bronze medal in the 1972 Olympic games in Munich with a discus throw of 63.40m but also equalled the world record in June 1972 with a throw of 68.40 meters. Bruch was also an outstanding shot putter with a lifetime best of 20.28 m and a bronze award from the European Championships in 1971.</p>
<p>Bruch made it to the next Olympic games in Montreal (1976), but did not make it past the qualifying rounds, an event that would spark his legacy. This failure set Bruch off, inspiring him to train harder than ever. He trained with tenacity and maniacal intensity for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. However, he was snubbed by the Swedish Olympic committee from competing. Bent on revenge, Bruch continued training and entered smaller competitions. Eventually in November of 1984 he set a new World and Swedish record with a 71.26m discus throw at 38 years old. This throw allowed Bruch to prove to himself, Sweden, and the world that he was the greatest thrower since the throw would have won the 1984 Olympic gold medal by nearly five meters. That throw places him 9th in the all-time list and still stands as the Swedish record today.</p>

<p>Some say that Bruch toed the line of insanity. That may be true, but his insanity was funneled into a supreme focus: to be as great as he could possibly be. This focused intensity inspired many, including this website, to devote to a mindset of success that brushes the realm of recklessness. Bruch was note solely a work-a-holic, <a href="/blog/2011/06/youre-welcome/" target="_blank">he enjoyed himself along the way</a>. Bruch has written a biography <em>Gladiatorns kamp</em> (The Gladiator’s Battle, released in 1990) and was the star of a documentary <em>Själen är större än världen</em> (<a href="http://www.johnpowellassociates.com/Ricky-Bruch.htm" target="_blank">The Soul Is Greater Than the World</a>). After a life of battle, rest in peace, and welcome to the 70’s Big Hall of Fame.</p>

  <p>I was talking to a friend online the other day, and he sent me <a href="http://youtu.be/1JUCb78Bevc" target="_blank">this video of a guy snatching</a>. The guy was a lighter lifter yet was snatching over 100kg and up to 122kg decently well. I didn’t know who he was, and I thought, “Oh, nice.” Then I saw that my friend had said, “I know you hate CrossFit, but we have some good lifters.”</p>
<p>I was shocked, and not because the lifter (who I later learned was Ben Smith) was a CrossFitter, but because my friend, who I’m pretty close with, thought I hated CrossFit (CF). So I wanted to clear this up. And by the way, Ben, that was some good lifting.</p>
<p>This website started when I was running the CF program when I was at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club. Before I moved there I had done CF for about a year, ran a CF group at my university, started an affiliate, and earned the Level II Certification (which is not easy to obtain). I enjoyed how I could compete against other people compared with my “bodybuilding structured” workouts (I posted on the main site for a few months — one time Gillian Mounsey and Chris Spealler were the few people to beat me). But I also loved lifting and wanted to do more of it. When I got to Texas, I considered keeping some conditioning work in my program, but opted to do a linear progression for real since it would help me coach other people.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>In the time at Texas I slowly shifted into Olympic weightlifting and was decent. I qualified for nationals at my third meet despite an injury two months prior. Meanwhile I traveled and worked for Rippetoe in the Barbell Certification Seminars, part of the specialty seminars that CrossFit HQ has available. Since then I have started doing my own 70’s Big workshops and they mostly occur in CF facilities.</p>
<p>I point all this boring shit out because I would say that I had a negative view of CF for most of the time I was in Texas despite running an affiliate. <strong>However, I’ve been involved with CF for four years and have traveled to many affiliate gyms around the world, and no longer look at CF negatively.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve said this before many times on this site, but CF has fantastic people involved in it. Most of the friends I have nowadays are a indirectly a result of CF or our interaction with it. When I attended the Level I in 2008, I was impressed with the lecture ability of Pat Sherwood and the military guys. They were willing to help, and Pat answered some of my e-mails months after the certification. I’m continually impressed with the kindness and willingness to not only help, but learn in the community. The desire to learn and get better is my favorite part of CF. CF has managed to foster an environment of people who rabidly want to know more, and are willing to pay money to do it. That’s a special thing, because spending money to do something represents full commitment into doing it (i.e. sacrificing to gain).</p>
<p>I also alluded to how I’ve met various people who are or have been involved in HQ like Chris Spealler, Todd Widman, and Adrian Bozman. I used the last two guys as coaching models early on and consider them the epitome of “good people” in CF. I’ve also met other “higher ups” in HQ like Nicole Carroll, Tony Budding, and Greg Glassman. I don’t know them very well but enjoyed the time I spent with them. <strong>That doesn’t mean I agree with everything they do or say, but I don’t even agree with everything my friends do.</strong> It may be entirely possible that these people, as well as others within HQ, think I’m an asshole or something. But I would suspect that while I have disagreements over <em>some</em> things they do, we still would have a jovial relationship if we were in the same room.</p>
<p>And besides, disliking somebody for different training methodology is bush league. Who am I to put down a guy who wants to “WOD his ass off”? I may disagree with the implementation of it (with respect to his goals or injury potential), but that doesn’t mean that guy is a bad person. Every training methodology has a group that looks at other groups unfavorably. I used to do this, but nowadays I just don’t give a shit. If someone wants my objective analysis of what they do with respect to their goals, then I’ll gladly give it to them (I’ve always aimed to help people). If someone wants to train for the CF games, I’m the first one to say, “Then do CF, (just make sure you’re strong).”</p>
<p>Skeptics of my stance might say I’m trying to suck the cock of CF with this post, but that’s not true. It’s easy to make fun of CF or the people that do it. There are silly or dumb aspects, but, again, there are silly things that my friends do. There are stupid weightlifters and stupid strength trainees. There are stupid Americans and Europeans. Every social group is going to have mock-able things going on, and that’s true of CF. I allow light jesting of CF on this website, but I’ve also defended it and put an end to overt criticism and mockery.</p>
<p>I just can’t hate something that has done so much for the realm of strength and conditioning, even if CF only consisted of assholes (it doesn’t). Glenn Pendlay <a href="http://www.pendlayforum.com/showpost.php?p=29453&#038;postcount=36" target="_blank">wrote this the other day</a> explaining how much CF has had an effect on the sport of Olympic weightlifting. CF is a catalyst for many athletes to “try and compete in new sports” which was one of the rules in early CF lore. And it’s worked. Powerlifting, weightlifting, adventure racing, and mud runs all benefit because of CF. There are legitimate places to train all over the world because of CF (some of them don’t allow you to do whatever you want, but many of them do — just ask). Not to mention that CF has allowed specialty experts like Kelly Starrett to improve the quality of training for all athletic activities (and this alone would be reason enough to like CF).</p>
<p>So I write as a beneficiary of CF in that it has exposed me to truly wonderful people, excellent gyms, plenty of opportunity, and improved my ability to coach and train. Sure, there may be a person doing something goofy every now and then, but that same person is willing to go out of there way to help you nearly 100% of the time. That’s why I don’t hate CrossFit.</p>

  <p><em>Monday’s are devoted to female related topics to help females begin or continue to train. This particular post is relevant to fellas as well.</em></p>
<p>Last week we discussed some methods to develop pull-ups, and some of the methods included close-grip or underhand pull-downs (on a cable machine for weaker trainees). Doing these exercises served two purposes: to develop strength within a given range of motion and to establish musculature. Building musculature in an area isn’t something that occurs quickly. I refer to this as “accumulating work over time”, because doing pull-ups, rows, or round back extensions need to happen consistently over a long period of time to garner an improvement in the musculature and subsequently strength.</p>
<p>Recently (in the last couple of years) I’ve had trainees do Hammer Strength rows (a plate loaded machine), pull-downs, various curls, dumbbell bench, dumbbell press, machine dips, and weighted sit-ups. The commonality among all of them: they were performed to develop lagging musculature or strength. By giving the musculature a consistent stress it will develop. However, the approach to doing these sets are not the same as traditional strength movements.</p>

<p>This video of Kai Greene rambling about a few things is quasi-relevant. His disdain for “weight lifters” (a term that is kinda misused here) is only natural given his chosen hobby and profession, but listen to what else he says.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JSl--NAwps" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>I think Kai Greene is knowledgeable about what he does, yet he is just raw in his ability to explain it. His first point is that bodybuilders aim to “stretch and contract their muscles”. This is why there are so many bullshit comments and articles about the “mind-body connection”; it’s referring to the ability to feel particular muscles in a movement and effectively work them. This attention to detail isn’t prevalent in the realm of strength training because strength training primarily demands moving the bar from point A to point B. The truth is that it isn’t that simple.</p>
<p>In my time of dicking around with “bodybuilding styles of training”, I developed this awareness. Nowadays I can perform a low bar squat in two different ways — one that uses the hamstrings and one that doesn’t — but make the two reps look identical. I have an awareness of what my triceps are doing in a press and what my lats do during a bench. This awareness is most relevant on a lift like the RDL, which is entirely dependent on stretching and contracting a muscle group instead of moving the bar from point A to B. Of course, if mechanics are sound, then the proper muscular action is a byproduct of doing a lift correctly, but muscle awareness can assist in the “means” to get to the “end”.</p>
<p>The second thing Kai Greene is talking about is lecturing the other dude on his curling technique. I would assume the other guy was using a lot of English and not getting good biceps work. The lesson is that if you’re trying to grow or develop a muscle, then working that muscle is more important than simply moving weight.</p>
<p>This concept is most relevant during assistance work. I specifically put exercises into training programs to develop musculature. The close-grip pull-downs for a weaker girl will develop strength, but more importantly give them a work load that will develop their muscles (I hesitate to say “grow muscles” since they won’t actually get that much bigger since they are a female with 1/10th the testosterone of a man, but I digress). Bigger muscles will move joints more efficiently, and developed muscles apply more force than muscles that haven’t received work. I use rows, dips, or RDLs to develop muscles to help with other movements, thus making the body stronger.</p>
<p>If you have a lagging group of muscles — whether they are lagging in size or in doing their job in a liftf — the time you spend on assisting that muscle should ensure it gets good contraction. Yes, doing RDL’s with 315 will look cool, but 185 is where most of you will get the best contraction. Ensure you understand how the muscle works and how to focus on the contraction of that muscle given the movement you are using. Feel your triceps while doing dips (externally rotate the shoulders by keeping the elbows close to the body and apply force through the heel of the palm), feel your lats while doing pull-downs and rows (think of the elbow driving back to the ribs), feel your biceps doing curls (don’t bring your elbow forward to use shoulder flexion), avoid flailing during weighted sit-ups, and keep tension on your hamstrings (by pushing the hips back and not letting the knees go forward). I could go on, but the point is that increasing your awareness to the contraction of your muscle(s) — particularly during assistance exercises — will help develop that musculature and augment the more important strength lifts. Not to mention you’ll get the full worth out of each rep by avoiding wasted effort.</p>

  <p>Greetings. I hope everyone had a delightfully arousing week. It’s <strong>PR Friday</strong>, so post your training updates or weekly PR’s to the comments. I do read the comments and I like to see how everyone is doing and identifying any problems you may have in training (since I can address the topic in a post).</p>
<p>[poll id=”37″]</p>
<p>This week started with a 70’s Big Female post discussing <a href="/blog/2012/01/programming-pull-ups/" target="_blank">how to program pull-ups</a> depending on the ability of the trainee. It was followed up by the strangely popular post that expresses irritation over bros in the gym and <a href="/blog/2012/01/sick-of-the-bro/" target="_blank">provides some ammunition</a> to support why you train the way you do. On Wednesday we discussed <a href="/blog/2012/02/hit-it-and-quit-it/" target="_blank">shorter training sessions</a> to maximize a positive hormonal response. Then on Thursday my mate Shannon Green from Australia showed us some <a href="/blog/2012/02/strongman-programming/" target="_blank">strongman programming templates</a>. Now let’s get on with the bloody Q&amp;A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="/blog/2012/01/programming-pull-ups/#comment-22430" target="_blank">Maslow asks:</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any recommendation for number of reps and sets for lat pull downs for a female who fits in that category? I’ve been having her do 3×8 with a weight that she can just barely do for 8 reps. I figured it’s important to build some mass in there so I did x8 instead of x5 but I don’t really know if that makes sense. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Maslow,</p>
<p>You’re doing it right. Girls in this area of adaptation — typically limited in lifting experience and can’t do a pull-up — will benefit from establishing some musculature. But since they are girls, they will increase musculature slowly, so they require an accumulated work load over a period of time to do it (guys are the same way, but faster). I like to implement a combination of higher and lower rep schemes in the same week to work both the hypertrophy and strength ranges respectively.</p>
<p>Note that using pull-downs (close grip or underhand) is a method I implement early on and try to transition into a progression like <a href="/blog/2012/01/programming-pull-ups/" target="_blank">this post</a>. I’ve even used some rowing machines (like the Hammer strength row) with girls who need upper back and shoulder musculature, but those girls eventually learned and perfected the barbell row and use it exclusively now.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear karibot,</p>
<p>There was a kid doing deadlifts with a trap with the large, iron 100 pound plates on a platform. The platform is one of those stupidly expensive ones with the nice glossy finish, and the octagon plates were destroying it. I stopped him and asked him to move it onto the rubber flooring since he was ruining the platform and, “If (he) ruined the platform, then I wouldn’t be able to use it. And that wouldn’t make me happy.”</p>

<p>I want to approach these squat rack curlers and tell them, ” Hey, there’s some set weight bars over there that you could easily curl and not take up the SQUAT rack.” I feel like they’d feel their pride was hurt and not respond well. Has anyone ever done this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear iamperfect,</p>
<p>Yes. I do this. Two days ago a guy was in a squat rack doing some (shitty) rows with 135, and I said to myself, “Oh, fuck this.” I walked over and (respectfully) said, “Excuse me. Would you mind moving to this other rack? We need to squat and this rack is safer.” I get pissed off when people are doing stupid shit, but it’s usually out of ignorance, so I’m rarely a dickhead. The fact that I’m typically bigger than them usually results in a QED, but being nice about it will convince most strangers to do what you ask. If they didn’t, then I would politely explain a few points in support of what I want and need. If they denied me, which has never happened, I would acidly say something like, “Yeah, because taking a rack for fucking curls makes a lot of sense,” while walking away. I have no qualms about being a dickhead, especially with “stuff in the gym”, but I highly recommend that you are all respectful and nice first. While I never did stupid shit in a rack, never walked in front of anyone, and always squatted to depth, I still probably did stupid things years ago. Acting like a “lifting tough guy” only makes you as much of a douche as them.</p>

<p>Justin – you’ve mentioned ascending sets a few times (like with 3×3 for Press).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you think about a reverse pyramid set, like Martin Berkhan uses? You warm up, hit your top set, then drop the weight 10% and add another rep, then the drop the weight again and add another rep. Eg.: Squat 250×5, 225×6, 200×7. What sort of trainee might benefit from this?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I squatted 245 3×5 on a LP recently, but the heavy 3×5 sets across for squat just leave me with nothing in the tank, totally wiped out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear gumbo,</p>
<p>I program descending sets as well as ascending sets, but the context of when I program them is dependent on the situation. It’s typically on a heavy where the lifter wants to be fresh for their heaviest set. However, the overall tonnage will typically be lower with descending sets because the weight typically has to drop lower. For example, if I do 190×5, 200×5, and then 210×5 on press, then my top (and final) set won’t be as heavy if I had done the heavy set first. However, if I did 215×5 or 220×5 first, I would probably not be able to do 200×5 as a second set. I would be safe in doing 190 or 195×5, but the 200×5 would may not go (I don’t know, I’ve never done it like this). The point is that the overall work load of the press will most likely be lower with descending sets compared to ascending sets.</p>
<p>Another example is Alex, Mike’s brother, who is getting ready for the Arnold. I wanted him to squat 550×2 last week, but he had mentioned how he had been using descending sets (I typically like ascending sets for powerlifters for several reasons). So he smoked 550×2 and then wasn’t able to double 530 (he singled it), and then doubled 510. If he had done ascending sets, he probably could have gone 520×2, 535×2, and 550×2. If he had done 20 pound jumps instead of 15 pound jumps, he could have gone 510×2, 530×2, then 550×2 — but he would have gotten the double at 530 instead of missing it due to doing 550×2 right before it. In that comparison, his tonnage would have only been different by one lift, but these things could matter in more advanced trainees.</p>

<p>i’m not in the business of disagreeing with Doctors (most of the time), nor saying I want to spend 24 hours in a gym…but don’t bodybuilders spend hours in the gym doing like 260 sets of tricep work? They have no problems with building lean mass. GRANTED it helps that they’ve got syringes hanging from their ass…but what i’m saying is wouldn’t bodybuilders and their size and the fact that they’ve been training the way they have for decades be a pretty strong case against this doctors theory?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear criedthefox,</p>
<p>First, this isn’t just a “theory” from Dr. Pascuale; it’s been researched. How thoroughly and how much it can be generalized, I admit I don’t know (I don’t have access to a university style journal thing right now and I spent half an hour trying to find studies the other day, but this was something we talked about in class when I was in school). But despite the fact that we don’t have the literature review in front of our faces, you know that this is true to some extent because if you train for too long, you feel beat down.</p>
<p>Secondly, even though you pointed this out, I don’t think you fully appreciate this statement: the bodybuilders you are referencing are on fucking steroids. Again, I don’t care that they are and don’t look down on them for doing it, but the “hormonal” game is not the same for you as it is them. If we’re only looking at testosterone and growth hormone in response to short and intense training sessions (which would not be the only thing effected, mind you), and a bodybuilder is supplementing with one of those things, then his hormonal profile functions in a different way than you. If he has much higher amounts of testosterone artificially put into his body, then the normal drop off due to training won’t occur for him. That’s why when people are “on”, they don’t get tired, don’t get sore, and feel like they can train forever (depending on what they are using and stuff).</p>
<p>Supplementing hormones will definitely change how a hormone normally occurs naturally. C’mon man.</p>

<p>Anyone have a good source from which to find weightlifting shoes with a half inch heal? Most of the places listed back from the previous 70sbig posts on shoes are not available anymore. Maybe I’m just an idiot but I am struggling to find a shoe with heal that isn’t 3/4 inch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear bohdi,</p>
<p>This isn’t what you were asking, but the significance of a half inch heeled shoe is over exaggerated. Plenty of people are strong as a result of a 3/4 inch heel. If someone required less of a heel to improve deadlift mechanics, then they typically use a flat shoe or deadlift slippers (which are much less expensive). I wouldn’t stress over trying to find a shoe with these requirements. As for the <a href="http://wp.me/sEKxw-gear" target="_blank">gear FAQ</a>, I just updated it. It’s painstakingly clear to me that you did no or absolutely little searching on this site or the internet. I forgive you.</p>

<p>@Justin, whats the time frame for someone doing snatch, c&amp;J and squat- is 15 ish minutes for each lift realistic as well? do you have any suggestions for tapering? I have a meet in two sundays and today I can do a light lift, on Friday I am gonna go heavy cuz I will be at a gym in california that I always max at and they have nice bars, so what do you suggest I do the last week before the comp. I was thinking only hit crisp medium weights early part of the week, then light crisp lifts on friday, rest sat, lift sunday. Also, anyone have any experience with keeping a pendlay bar in an open air area? I think I need to buy one cuz my york power bar is gonna break my wrist by not spinning, but I use it in an open air sunroom taht gets significant moisture and I dont want to ruin a nice bar. Maybe glenn could comment on this bad boy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear strongerthanyesterday,</p>
<p>Training specifically for a goal will be different than a general approach for the “short session” emphasis. However, if you’re snatching and cleaning, then you should be able to do both of those in 45 minutes in an up tempo workout. This is why many weightlifters will have multiple sessions in a day with a 20 minute rest or breaking for lunch — they take advantage of the same principles that were laid out in the “short session” post. But, it just depends on the situation and the lifter.</p>
<p>Your plan for the meet is a good one. Some people are able to go fairly heavy early in the week while beginners would probably do well to hit successful medium weights to build confidence. You won’t get any stronger in the last week, but you can improve your ability by getting proper rest. Your plan to hit some light weights at the end of the week is a good one and is my standard approach for “newer” lifters. I also fully support <a href="/blog/2012/02/hit-it-and-quit-it/#comment-22524" target="_blank">Doogie’s comment</a> that you have already seen.</p>
<p>As for keeping a bar, don’t leave it outside. It would still function decently enough (depending on it’s moisture exposure), but if you’re going to spend money and rely on it, then bring it inside and store it in a corner or a closet when not in use. There’s no sense in leaving it outside unless you sleep and live outside all of the time. If that’s the case, send us a video tour of your house.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear willey,</p>
<p>Without the context of your program, you’ll obviously require the longer rest periods for your sets of squats to continue accomplishing your daily goal. If you’re almost done with the LP, then don’t worry about conditioning as it will inhibit necessary recovery. Sometimes in a linear progression, “failing” is just the end product of chronically going beyond the limit of what would be a “good stress” for the body. In other words, if you get to the point of finally failing after already doing several resets, it’s the result of too much stress and not enough recovery over a period of one to several weeks. This can be helpful from a psychological perspective (to learn what this feels like), but I’d rather avoid it as a programmer. With respect to the conditioning, just wait for the program adjustment. Don’t simply “rest” and try to continue your LP because it will only delay the inevitable, and natural, need to change the stress application.</p>
<p>A general point on the “shorter session” concept is that it will depend on the context of the program and goals. If you are prepping for a power meet or only care how strong your squat is, then yes, you should be fully rested. I thought I made this clear in the post. Instead, you guys that obviously need more rest should look to see how you can trim the fat off your workout. Are you fucking around talking to a friend for two minutes every five minutes? Are you just sitting around until you “feel” ready? If you start quantifying the length of time you spend resting and the length of the session, you’ll start to see how much time you waste. This may or may not be relevant to you. It is to me.</p>
<h2 id="and-lastly-a-word-on-52155-in-the-texas-method">And lastly, a word on 5×5 in the Texas Method</h2>
<p>Several people have asked and informed me that a lot of fellas are wanting an elaboration on what I meant when I referenced not being a fan of 5×5 on a TM. This isn’t a new concept, and I’ve mentioned it on this site a few times, but I can understand the confusion. I didn’t make a huge deal about wanting to decrease the volume in the Volume Day of a TM in the first e-book, but I did talk about it. I even gave examples of Chris doing 3×5. I purposely didn’t make a huge deal about it because it wasn’t the focus of the book. It is, however, the focus of the second e-book. I originally did not intend so much time to pass in between the release of the books, but it’s actually a good thing for the reader. There have been a handful of major changes I’ve made to the “advancing” chapters — things I would consider a “breakthrough” in how to program late stage intermediate lifters. It has given me more time to use trial and error from good and bad results.</p>
<p>With that being said, the e-book has been written, but I’m still in the editing process and updating some of the chapters. I’ve had unnecessary and necessary delays, but I also care about giving my customer a very good product. I can assure you that the content in this e-book blows the first one out of the water in terms of quality and applicability not just to TM users, but all intermediate level lifters (which includes pretty much everyone here).</p>
<p>As for the drop of volume on the Volume Day, it is explained in very fine detail in this new e-book. There’s an entire chapter talking about why to do it. In the mean time, I suggest that has been using 5×5 for at least two months to start dropping it down. If you don’t want to, that’s fine. But I know that it works better, and all of the reasons — more than you could ever want — are in this next book. The results also speak very loudly. Mike’s brother Alex just squatted 550×2, Chris squatted 635×2 on his third double the other day and will hit between 650 and 665 at the Arnold. Mike has done around 550×2 and will hit around 585 at the Arnold despite having to do a PT test in the last month. In any case, decrease the total volume and see what happens (if you need specifics, use 3×5, or if you’re scared, use ascending 5×5 with 20 pound jumps or something). If you’re training for a powerlifting, you’ll get a huge boner over the content in the next e-book.</p>
<p>With that being said, I will re-double my efforts to finish the text and get it to you. I’m excited for everyone to see and use it — it will be one of the most useful things I’ve ever written.</p>

  <p>Shannon Green of <a href="http://warriorperformance.com.au/" target="_blank">Warrior Performance</a> in Australia has a thick accent. My mate Tom says, “I live here and sometimes I don’t know what he’s saying.” But the words that come out of his mouth are top notch, and he can make you a strongman. His favorite hobby is competing in strongman competitions (he also makes good coffee, but that’s neither here nor there). We did a post on <a href="/blog/2011/12/strongman-training-for-beginners/" target="_blank">how to train for strongman as a beginner</a>, and today’s post is a sequel in that it discusses programming for someone that has transitioned into primarily training for an event.</p>
<p>Shannon is quick to point out that there’s no best way to train for strongman and that most guys will figure out their own unique template that they’ve adapted to. They know their body and figure out what works for them, and that’s why Shannon considers establishing “table tennis strength” important before doing heavy event training. By getting strong, the trainee will have a good understanding of how their body adapts to stress as well as experience with lifting and training. Heavy events are progressions or variants of different strength lifts, but their dynamic nature demands experience, balance, and connective tissue strength.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>After transitioning into event training (as discussed in the <a href="/blog/2011/12/strongman-training-for-beginners/" target="_blank">first post</a>), Shannon suggests develop a base with the event activities. As with any new activity, take it easy with the events at first and develop the technique first while progressing them slowly. Meanwhile, continue getting stronger in the gym. Below are two programming template examples.</p>
<h2 id="shan8217s-template">Shan’s Template</h2>
<p>This first program template is Shannon’s program he personally uses. Training the events can be very taxing, so Shannon prefers more recovery days (although they have guys who train 4 to 5 days a week). It’s three training days a week with two in the weight room, and it’s six days that rotate every six weeks. As far as loading, Shannon says, “You can use 5/3/1, Texas Method, Westside, or whatever tickles your pickle. They all work. I use a bastardized Westside/531. I do speed work 60-70%, reps with 80 to 85% (sometimes around comp weight, sometimes to improve my max reps in a time limit), and I go for 1-3RMs to get new PB’s.” Lifts that are separated by a slash indicates he does the first one in the first week and the second in the second week.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p>Back Squat/Front Squat</p>
<p>Good Morning/Deadlift</p>
<p>Bench/Dip</p>
<p>Row/Chin</p>
<p>GHR/Calve Raise</p>
<p><strong>Day2</strong></p>
<p>Power Clean/Power Snatch</p>
<p>Press/Chin</p>
<p>Front Squat/Back Squat</p>
<p>Maybe some curls if I could be bothered</p>
<p><strong>Day 3 – Event Training</strong></p>
<p>Back Squat/Front Squat</p>
<p>Walking Event – Farmers/Yoke</p>
<p>Pressing Event – Log/Axle/Monster DB</p>
<p>Hip Extension &amp; Loading – Stones/Tyre flip/Strongman Deadlift (Bar, axle, car, generally from 18-19” height)</p>
<p>Accessory – Reverse hyper/45* Back extension</p>
<p>“Every 4-5 weeks we will drag or push something – sled/truck. Event training is rotated all the time, I do take time off from event training and just do barbell work as well.” Note that Shannon’s Day 2 is kind of like a light day after his heavier day on Day 1. Then he seems to have more rest after the event training day because he says it’s pretty taxing.</p>
<h2 id="template-2">Template #2</h2>
<p>“Another way to do it is to train the events as max effort spread across the week and just use barbell work as accessory.” Note: ME = Max effort, DE = Dynamic effort</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<p>ME Upper (Log, axle, DB, Viking press)</p>
<p>Accessory: Bench, lats, tris</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>DE Lower (Box squats, speed pulls, or speed stones without tacky)</p>
<p>Accessory: Reverse hyper, GHR</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<p>DE Upper (Dynamic log press with bands)</p>
<p>Accessory: Lats, tris, rotator cuff</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>ME Lower (Yoke, farmer’s, deads, dragging, stones with tacky)</p>
<p>Accessory: Reverse hyper</p>
<p>This particular template has a good distribution throughout the week and includes more event training. It would probably suit a guy who has built up significant strength in the conventional lifts (e.g. a guy like Chris) and needs to apply it to the specificity of strongman events. It’s almost like a skill or conditioning phase where the strength is used for a specific grouping of events.</p>
<p>Above are just two types of options for a programming template. Remember that it will always vary on the individual, their strength adaptation, what equipment they have available, how experienced they are in the events, and how close they are to an actual competition. I asked Shannon what events he considers the most physically stressful and whether he would put them at the beginning or end of the training session:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will be individual. For me, the yoke is most stressful, but a lot of guys find stones really hard at first. Stones require tacky if you want to go heavy, so they are generally at the end of a workout, but they generally come last in a comp. But strongman doesn’t have a fixed structure, so I think it’s good to mix it up occasionally since on the day thing may change. Use an Army or Marine mentality and be prepared for the worst-case scenario, oorah!</p>

  <p>No, this didn’t turn into a sex or relationship advice column, but it is a good piece of advice. For training. <a href="http://youtu.be/rs5w02NvSyI?t=2m42s" target="_blank">And stuff</a> (uh, NSFW for language?).</p>

<p>When you walk out of the gym, do you know how much time has passed? Or do you feel like you’re surfacing from underwater, breathing heavily, and gasping, “What happened, I blacked out?” Knowing how much time is relevant, because you most likely need to decrease that amount of time. I spent about half an hour looking for references on this topic, but I don’t have access to scholarly sources and my textbooks were vague, but Dr. Pascuale’s “Amino Acids and Proteins for the Athlete” provided the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Androgens such as testosterone (and trophic hormones such as LH) increase with intense exercise as long as it is not exhausting. Thus, short intense training sessions will give the best results and maximize lean body mass and strength. When exercise duration is too long, the level of testosterone decreases. Thus repetitive and prolonged heavy exercise results in overtraining and in decreased protein synthesis and increased muscle catabolism (pg 340-341).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>He continues on how short, intense workouts also benefit growth hormone as well. This, of course, wasn’t the first time I had seen this information, but lately I’ve been experimenting with shorter duration workouts. All of you who have had a two or three hour training session know that towards the end you’re drained and devoid of any life force; the Others have taken you. In contrast, when you get your work down very quickly, you may feel invigorated or feeling that you could have done more. That’s a good feeling! Feeling that you did too little is better than feeling that you did too much, and it results in better progress.</p>
<p>Physiological reasoning for a short duration training session include maximizing the efficacy of anabolic hormones (like testosterone and growth hormone), maximizing the potential for protein synthesis, and fitting in the standard “insulin”, or anabolic, window that is created by having protein and fast digesting carbs pre-workout. Not to mention there’s the psychological benefit from not being drained as well as having completed the session in a timely manner. The physiological and psychological implications could improve or at least limit the negative effects on a trainee’s emotional state. If you have kids, dogs, or work to take care of once you get home, you’ll be in a better frame of mind. Enjoying dinner and watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySptysWzA-Y" target="_blank">Bert Macklin</a> is preferable to lying on the floor and wishing you were dead. Trust me, I know.</p>
<p>Good strength programs will include two, maybe three primary lifts with one or two assistance exercises. The average number of lifts or exercises included in a session is three or four; there’s no reason that such a workout can’t be completed in an hour.</p>
<p>Guys using traditional Texas Method templates will be the first to pipe up and say, “But five sets of five takes almost an hour.” You’re right; they do. That’s part of the reason that five sets squats aren’t used in anything I program (and strength increases are much better without that volume — <a href="/ebook/" target="_blank">read more here</a>). <strong>A good guideline is to try and complete each exercise, including warm-ups, in 15 minutes.</strong> More demanding lifts like the squat or deadlift can increase to 20 minutes. This sets a parameter of timeliness in the training session.</p>
<p>I always tell my trainees that they should complete the first three warm-ups of any exercise back-to-back-to-back. For squat or deadlift, that would be hitting 135, 225, and 315 in sequence (bench could be 135, 185, 225 while press could be 135, 155, and 175). Remember to titrate repetitions down as the weight increases to avoid undue fatigue for the work sets. The first three warm-ups should happen within five minutes (and often quicker). Subsequent warm-ups can be off-set by a minute or so can of rest, and then three to five minutes of rest could be used between work sets.</p>
<p>Rest periods will obviously be dependent on the training intensity. If a trainee is working with a tough 3×5 with sets across, they may need five to seven minutes of rest. Most of you will have crept out of a linear progression and can account for this with ascending sets or intelligent programming (a topic for another day) that contains the rest periods. Keep in mind that the rest periods will probably increase between subsequent work sets; resting before the third set will take a bit longer than the amount of rest between the last warm-up and the first set.</p>
<p>In order to keep an eye on your rest periods and total session time, I like to wear watch. Just start the time it once you start warming up with a bar (my time excludes dynamic warm-up and mobility work). When you’re resting, just look at the current time and add three minutes to that. At the three minute mark, gauge how you’re feeling and decide if you can complete the set or if you need more time. If you routinely need more time, it could indicate that you’re using large amounts of weight (which is fine given the context of your program), but it could also indicate a lack of conditioning on your part. When I did 200m sprints last week, my heart rate dropped from 183 to 123 in less than two minutes (I’ll get some numbers on a lifting session; forget to wear the monitor Monday). That capability would indicate that I should have good recovery between sets. This doesn’t mean you need to do sprints, but that GPP work is standard in many powerlifting or strength programs, and you shouldn’t be an exception (unless prepping for a meet).</p>
<p>Another way to shorten the duration of a workout is to complete assistance exercise in a super-set fashion (e.g. pull-ups with GHR). Obviously you should avoid lifts or exercises that would be debilitating to each other, but most assistance work can be combined. The “rest between” sets will merely include you walking back and forth. This works well because it not only completes the rest of your assistance work in a timely manner, but it can provide a wee bit of a conditioning stress. If you haven’t done any GPP work, super setting some assistance will get your heart pumping and make you sweat a little. It’ll be good for you.</p>
<p>You can also complete “finisher” type work in the same way. I’ve also been experimenting with non-lifting finishers in my sessions. One example is super setting heavy farmer’s walks for a 25 meter round trip with side planks (a deceivingly effective exercise for lumbar spine health and rehab — more on this another time). Last week I completed three farmer’s walks and three sets of side planks (30 seconds on each side) in about five minutes. The total training session time (that included bench, squat, BB row, and RDLs) was about 1 hour and 5 minutes. Aesthetic focused exercises, like curls, work well as finishers and they benefit most from short rest periods anyway (i.e. higher rep schemes with short rest intervals favor hypertrophy).</p>
<p>One hour is a good guideline, but you can also work with 1:15 or 1:30. Your mindset going forward should be:</p>
<p>1:30+ — debilitating for recovery</p>
<p>1:15 to 1:30 — decent</p>
<p>1:00 to 1:15 — good</p>
<p>1:00 and under — great</p>
<p>This mentality works exceptionally well in light or medium sessions, especially when coming back from a layoff, injury, or illness. By having an up-tempo emphasis throughout the session, you’ll maximize your ‘anabolic window’, increase your metabolism, and get your shit done in a timely manner. For some of you, trimming the fat off your training session will actually help you. Deleting some unnecessary asssitance will help your body focus it’s recovery efforts into the fundamental lifts (see <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/2011/05/high-frequency-program.html" target="_blank">this article</a> by Dr. Hartman)</p>
<p>Some programs may demand long sessions, and they can sometimes be helpful — some powerlifting meets will last 8 hours! But most of you are general strength trainees who are trying to be strong and look strong. The shorter duration emphasis will have a better effect on both getting stronger and growing musculature. <a href="http://youtu.be/rs5w02NvSyI?t=2m42s" target="_blank">So hit it and quit it</a>; no need to hang around.</p>
