  <p>When I walked into the gym yesterday, there was a group of guys in the squat rack doing upright rows and shrugs with less than 100 pounds. There was a lot of fist bumping. Next to them was a well-meaning kid doing half squats with weight most girls I know can squat to depth. Then I saw a guy exploring his 1RM <a href="http://cdn2.mothernature.com/books/images/PeakCond/Arm-7bpg.GIF" target="_blank">nosebreaker</a> without a spot (he barely survived). Later in the locker room I heard a guy who walks around like he’s impressive brag about his whey protein, “It’s got hydrolized and ionized whey in it. I can’t wait to have my two shakes every day.” I’m normally calm and under control, but these events made me want to flip out.</p>
<p>The to weak shruggers I’d shout, “YOU’RE NOT ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING!”</p>
<p>To the nose breaker I’d shout, “WHY WOULD YOU HIT A 1 REP MAX IN THAT?”</p>
<p>To the protein braggart I’d shout, “DO YOU EVEN LIFT?”</p>

<p>I’m sick of rear flyes, upright rows, and Smith machines. I’m sick of 30 minute elliptical sessions, half squats, and triceps extensions. Most of all, I’m sick of seeing people misinformed. I wish I could help everyone, but not everyone believes they need help. Coercion is a simpleton’s game. What I can do instead is to make sure that you, the “well-informed reader” understand why you do what you do. In the event you’re asked about it, you can effectively share this information legitimately. That two minute conversation will make or break your friend’s acceptance of “training” instead of “fucking around”.</p>

<p><strong>Strength training is the best way to establish a fantastic base of musculature because it uses compound lifts that induce an effective systemic stress in order to give the greatest return on time and effort investment.</strong></p>
<p>The above statement could also say “strength training is the best way to train” since being strong and the process of obtaining strength are the fundamental capacity for all physical endeavors. The process begins with an emphasis on compound barbell lifts. The barbell is preferable over dumbbells because it can provide a greater stimulus due to the greater load as well as balancing the load evenly across both sides of the body (instead of demanding contralateral stabilization). Compound lifts like the squat, press, row, and deadlift utilize a large amount of musculature <em>through a full range of motion</em> (ROM). Using a partial ROM accomplishes nothing, kills puppies, and is the work of Satan. These full ROM, fundamental movements are the definition of “functional” in that they train all of the muscles and joints that could be involved in any bodily action. Every muscle is used in synergy with it’s surrounding muscles to produce each movement efficiently. In contrast, isolation training isn’t “functional” because muscles don’t work solo when the body applies force to the ground or objects. When proper technique is used — and it’s not difficult to learn — compound lifts are safe and efficient. Most of all, since compound lifts use the greatest amount of musculature, the muscles get the most work to get the most strong and can get the most big without extremely high levels of work.</p>
<p>When musculature is used at the cusp of it’s capability, the fibers receive stress and are damaged. When large amounts of structures have just received a stress from compound movements, the neuroendocrine system is activated to heal and adapt. The hormonal response to compound lifting is much higher than both isolation exercises or a workout program to train a “body part” each day. This systemic response results in a heightened metabolism that, when compounded with a good diet, will effectively build muscle and lose fat. Aside from getting stronger, this systemic stress is strength training’s greatest effect. It allows for the “bro goal” of getting “swole”, the “strong goal” of getting stronger and more able, the “fat person goal” of dropping fat, and the “average goal” of getting the greatest return on time and effort investment.</p>
<p>Many fitness and physique programs include up to 30 sets for a given body part. A standard strength training program will have 9 to 12 work sets (not including warm-ups) in a whole training session. If the trainee caps their rest periods, this can easily be completed in 45 to 60 minutes. Compound barbell sessions will train the entire body, make it stronger, and apply a systemic stress that can’t be achieved with conventional fitness training. High intensity conditioning accomplishes the same thing if the trainee wanted to add it in for improved endurance or aesthetics. Conditioning done with intensity can last anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, and it’s resultant adaptation is better than if the trainee had performed standard cardio for 30 to 45 minutes. Metabolism is heightened significantly after intense conditioning; much more so than “regular cardio”. Strength training and high intensity conditioning provide the greatest return on the time and effort investment compared to conventional fitness or physique training.</p>
<p>The effect — the end result — that gym goers are going for can be achieved more quickly if they had an understanding of proper training and diet protocol. Unfortunately millions of people are fed the constant bullshit from the fitness industry and government. In the end, hard and consistent work will produce desired results, but effort would be better repaid if strength training became the foundation. Do not aim to travel the land in hopes of converting people to “the truth”. Instead, understand why what you do is better and amiably explain it if the opportunity arises. Pay close attention to your own training so that it results in optimum performance <em>and</em> health, and you’ll be an ambassador for smart, efficient training. Lead by example…and make sure your friends squat to depth.</p>

  <p><em>Monday’s are devoted to female related topics to help females begin or continue to train.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2011/12/5883/" target="_blank">this post</a>, about 40% of female poll-takers said that they couldn’t do a pull-up (while 7% said they could at least do a chin-up). <a href="/blog/2011/12/developing-a-pull-up/" target="_blank">In this post</a> we talked about how to develop a chin-up (underhand) or pull-up (overhand), but only briefly talked about programming these methods. While the Frequency Method works well, there is some leeway on how to implement it. We’ll discuss how to go about improving the pull-up based on current ability, give tips about the Frequency Method, and offer some other methods.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/01/female-pull-up.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6230" data-permalink="/blog/2012/01/programming-pull-ups/female-pull-up/" data-orig-file="/2012/01/female-pull-up.jpg" data-orig-size="234,216" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="female-pull-up" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/01/female-pull-up.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/01/female-pull-up.jpg" src="/2012/01/female-pull-up.jpg" alt="" title="female-pull-up" width="234" height="216" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6230" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What To Do</strong></p>
<p>Here are the levels from no chin-up to pull-up (use <a href="/blog/2011/12/developing-a-pull-up/" target="_blank">this post</a> for explanation). Note that the chin-up will develop first, so all movements focus on that unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>**CONTINUE READING</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>No chin-up, weak:</em> Use the close-grip pull-down cable machine in your gym. If you attend a non-fitnessy gym, then use some sort of <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.thecardioblog.com/media/2007/07/pull_up_start.jpg" target="_blank">body rows</a>.</p>
<p><em>No chin-up, not so weak:</em> Use negatives.</p>
<p><em>No chin-up, weak in top half (lockout):</em> Use “Double Negatives” for the top range of motion.</p>
<p>[spoiler show=”What’s a Double Negative?” hide=”Oh, cool”]Start at the finished ROM like a normal negative, do a negative down to the halfway point (or when the elbows are about 90 degrees), and then return back to the top ROM. Then, do a normal negative. So that was down and up through the top half, then down all the way through the full ROM until getting to the bottom. That’s one rep.[/spoiler]</p>
<p><em>No chin-up, weak in bottom half (getting started):</em> Use Double Negatives for bottom ROM.</p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Tell me how” hide=”Neat”]Start at the top, drop all the way down, use the stretch reflex out of the bottom to go as high as possible, then negative the rest of the way down. So, do a negative down, rebound and go as high as possible, then negative from that point down followed by a full, regular negative.</p>
<p>Method B would be to start at the bottom (hanging), start the chin and go as high as you can, then negative from that point back to the bottom. Then hop to the top ROM and do a full negative. So try a chin from the bottom and negative down, then do a full, regular negative after.[/spoiler]</p>
<p><em>Chin-up! Yay! But only one?:</em> Maintain frequency method, but with full ROM (more in later sections).</p>
<p><em>Regular chin-ups, no pull-up:</em> Start hitting doubles on chins for a week, then triples. Then start on pull-ups.</p>
<p><em>Chin-ups are pretty solid, but no pull-up:</em> Alternate between workouts that focus on chin-ups (see previous point) and pull-ups. Find out where you are on this list on the pull-up and start there. If you can’t lock it out, then work the top ROM. If you can’t get out of the bottom, then work that ROM. If it’s no dice either way, use negatives.</p>
<p>Note that you’ll occasionally (i.e. once every 7 to 10 days) attempt a dead hang chin or pull-up. If you show progress, then shift to the next point.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency Method Tips</strong></p>
<p>First, pick the days that you will do your exercises. Common options include the weekdays with weekends off, or every day except for Thursday and Sunday (which would be three days in a row, off day, two days in a row, then another off day).</p>
<p>Second, find out where you are on the list in the previous section. Use that method primarily in your training, but pick a rep range to complete daily. Let’s start with ten repetitions; it’ll provide a bit of volume but probably not too much on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Third, distribute it throughout the day. If you’re diligent and really organized, you might have a rigid plan. It all depends on your personality, but rigid plans are hard to make a habit. Instead, let’s just break it up into two sessions: morning and night. Do half of your reps in the morning before work or school, and do the rest at night. You’ll need a pull-up bar; they aren’t expensive. Get one that looks <a href="http://www.marinebootcamp.net/2010/11/doorway-pull-up.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> unless you’re going to drill into your house (anything more fancy is just bullshit). It will cost less than $30.</p>
<p>There, you’re all set. You can either progress the stress by a) changing the movement as indicated by our list in the previous section or b) by increasing the number of reps you perform. Doing these reps morning and night on a daily basis may be a pain in the ass, but do you want to be a champion? Or a girl who can’t do a pull-up? That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>Another Simple Method</strong></p>
<p>Let it be known that some kind of Frequency Method will be the most effective way of developing the pull-up. However, there are still other options. The easiest way is to train them at the end of your training sessions. Use all of the above methods in the same way, but do it at the end of your training session (but do them before any isolation work, like curls, or conditioning).</p>
<p>Now you need to complete a given amount of reps in a short amount of time instead of freely doing them throughout the day. The easiest way is to complete each set on the minute. This will cut down potential talking time and get the chin-up portion done in about ten minutes. At some point you’ll shift into this anyway, because if your strength gets high enough where you’re able to complete many reps, then the daily work on the Frequency Method will be too hard to recover from. So the progression will shift into about three workouts a week. Once the pull-up (not just the chin-up) becomes automatic, then you can start using one weighted session with one body weight session for a total of two pull-up sessions a week. After progressing to consistent multi-rep sets and handling extra weight, you can use any of the methods briefly described in <a href="/blog/2011/06/pull-up-challenge/" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/01/pull-up-cat-620x465.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6231" data-permalink="/blog/2012/01/programming-pull-ups/pull-up-cat-620x465/" data-orig-file="/2012/01/pull-up-cat-620x465.jpg" data-orig-size="145,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pull-up-cat-620&#215;465" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/01/pull-up-cat-620x465.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/01/pull-up-cat-620x465.jpg" src="/2012/01/pull-up-cat-620x465.jpg" alt="" title="pull-up-cat-620x465" width="145" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6231" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>While this may have simply been a review for some trainees, the overall point is that there isn’t one stock way to train pull-ups for all abilities. There are plenty more ways to develop a pull-up. Bands are often used, but typically I like to avoid bands since they aren’t as specific to the movement as actually hanging from the bar (e.g. the trunk stabilization is often non-existent in banded pull-ups).</p>
<p>The trainee’s ability in the movement will dictate how they go about it in their training session, and the training sessions should shift from low volume and high frequency to lowering the frequency and increasing the volume and/or intensity. Just remember that pull-ups are cool, but people who do pull-ups and never squat are not.</p>

  <p>Greetings lovely readers. I hope you had a jolly week. It’s PR Friday, so share your weekly PR’s and training updates. Today I want to hear what mobility concerns you have. In other words, what structures/joints do you need to work on the most?</p>
<p>Also, we will continue yesterday’s poll. If you already voted, please refrain from doing so.</p>
<p>[poll id=”36″]</p>
<p>This week started with a short video on <a href="/blog/2012/01/push-up-cues/" target="_blank">Push-up cues</a> that can specifically help females augment their strength training within the confines of a good externally rotated shoulder position. We then discussed what I call “<a href="/blog/2012/01/antagonistic-motivation/" target="_blank">Antagonistic Motivation</a>” to provide long-term motivation in a program. On Wednesday we discussed the importance of keeping a good <a href="/blog/2012/01/logging-progress/" target="_blank">training log</a> and Thursday we explained and discussed <a href="/blog/2012/01/jumpshrug-vs-catapult/" target="_blank">pulling styles in Olympic weightlifting</a>.</p>

<p>This first question is related to the “Antagonistic Motivation” post in which I said the following in a comment reply: “The “Antagonistic Motivation” method isn’t a requirement, but the most succesful people in any realm are driven by an undying need to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>They have some kind of specific motivation for doing so, and if someone’s training was so-so, this is a way to heighten their focus.”</p>

<p>Great feedback on this post, I love reading about what motivates people deep down.</p>
<p>I thought my response was interesting enough to re-post:</p>
<p>I believe it’s innate in every person, but they need a reason to unleash it. Have you ever read Alas Babylon? If our country was attacked by nuclear weapons and we all had to depend on ourselves (or local population) to actually survive, then everyone would be motivated to do so. Circumstance will dictate the reason. In today’s society we are fortunate enough not to have to worry about survivability because of technological development. It’s possible to live life in a set career field and not do more than what is asked. Motivation is reduced when people get comfortable. The difference in truly successful people and comfortable people is that the successful are never comfortable, and to them, they equate surviving with success. Failing is dying. Sometimes this is literal (imagine oppressed third world populations) and other times it’s symbolic.</p>
<p>Because of this inherent complacency, training can grow a bit stale. It doesn’t make us pathetic or lower quality humans, but we can amp up our training by creating a motivational stimulus. Today’s focus was creating an enemy. By forcing and developing an enemy, we can inject purpose into training and life. Undying craving for success in a sport will undoubtedly carry over and augment motivation in life. And even if it doesn’t, we are better people for having that drive, even in some small way.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear Josh,</p>
<p>RE: Utility in movements.</p>
<p>You know I love saying “utility”. It depends on which movement we are talking about. The most relevant and effective movement on your list is the rack pull. The rack pull is what I use in programming to develop the “resistance of fatigue” in the hamstrings for deadlifting in competition. Whereas in the squat, if you only squat a few heavy reps, you can adapt to squatting multiple sets and it can improve meet performance. In the deadlift, that practice doesn’t work as well since deadlifting is so stressful to the system and local structures.</p>
<p>Instead of doing multiple sets of heavy deadlift, I love programming rack pulls from right below the knee. I talk about rack pulls extensively in the Texas Method Part 2 e-book (which I’ve been working on), and they are useful because of <a href="/2012/01/hamstringtension.png" target="_blank">this concept</a>. When doing them, the lumbar muscles hold the pelvis in place which maintains tension on the hamstrings. Then the hamstrings receive very high amounts of tension which allows them to adapt to this lockout stress. By doing a set of three to five reps, it forces the lumbar and hamstring musculature to maintain tension to hold their position <em>while fatigued</em>. This improves lockout ability in a meet. Once a lifter gets experienced with rack pulls, he can use them for greater weights with fewer reps (i.e. Chris just rack pulled 700 after doing 675×2).</p>
<p>As for the UTILITY in the other movements, it depends on the activity and the context of the trainee’s adaptation, program, and goals. Yoke walks are cool and hard, but are most useful to strongman competitors. I don’t program pin presses and don’t they have as much UTILITY as other programmatic methods, but I would consider using them in advanced programs. However, I they would be a last resort; in late intermediate or advanced type lifters, it’s typical to work on a specific part of a lift’s range of motion. In general I’d rather work on the problem ROM while doing the full movement (with the exception of rack pulls as a priority) or use a small list of assistance exercises to improve the strength and musculature of the weak ROM.</p>
<p>If someone is just randomly doing these movements as heavy as possible, then they are probably a dick measuring type of lifter or on a program like Westside that depends on movement variation.</p>
<p>RE: “stimulating the nervous system”</p>
<p>This is a fucking bullshit term that over simplifies the function of the body. I absolutely hate the term because it makes it seem like our central nervous system is getting “tired” from a given activity. It’s a disgusting simplification that is a small piece of what matters. It probably originated by guys who were trying to simplify concepts for other people on a discussion board, and it became a buzz word.</p>
<p>When you train, you work specific structures. “Structures” is a term that includes any relevant musculature as well as tendons, ligaments, fascia, and bones. Even though you don’t feel anything occurring in your bones, they receive and distribute stress and need to adapt just like every single structure in the body. Training places a stress on these structures, and I sum that up as a “localized” stress to imply that what you specifically target is typically worked (i.e. squats will focus on the hips and legs, deadlifts on the back and posterior chain, etc.). As a result of these local structures receiving stress, there is a related systemic stress. This is includes the nervous system and endocrine system, summed up as the “neuroendorcrine” system (since the functioning of one is closely related to the other). This is when the body controls the release and inhibition of various hormones in order to produce the adaptation relative to the stress you just imposed. When we simplify and say “you recover and adapt”, it’s the neuroendocrine system that does all of this behind-the-scenes work.</p>
<p>So if you cause more damage locally, then you will have a higher systemic stress. If you cause moderate amounts of stress too frequently (e.g. by doing a CrossFit workout six times a week), then the system will be pushed into deficit. When the person is run down and unable to complete a something that is normally easy when fresh, they will say, “Man, my CNS is so fatigued,” when in fact they mean “my system is depressed”. It’s better to think in terms of “the system” because it’s interrelated with every system in the body. If you induce too much stress on the body too often, then your immune system (which is closely related with the neuroendocrine system) is also depressed. The reverse is true; if your immune system is depressed, then your system cannot handle stress. Simplify it by thinking in terms of your system, and your system is dependent on your health and all of the recovery concepts (like diet, sleep, mobility, rest, etc.). So stop saying “CNS” because that’s like saying the mail clerk at Google is on strike; it’s just one little piece of Google that hardly tells the whole story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having trouble with keeping my elbows up during my front squat work. Any tips/assisstance exercises that can help with this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Matt,</p>
<p>This is a bit vague since I don’t know exactly what you’re referring to, but work on your external rotation in your shoulders. You might as well work on the internal rotation since if the internal rotators are tight, they won’t stretch as easily when you go into severe external rotation. Do soft tissue work on your external rotators (i.e. roll them with a lacrosse ball). Become a student of shoulder work on MWOD. When in doubt, start with the <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-211365-the-simple-five-way-shoulder.html" target="_blank">5 way shoulder</a>. Start with this search query. Also, roll your thoracic spine (particularly between the scapulae/shoulder blades) with two lacrosse balls taped together.</p>
<p>As for the rack position itself, think “elbows up and in”; many people leave out the “in” part and it makes things difficult. Lastly, I often need to correct the grip width; if you have long forearms, you’ll need to have a wider grip than you think to facilitate the “elbows up and in” position.</p>

<p><em>J.T. M. asks:</em></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any opinion on knees over toes when squatting? Rip says avoid, other people say it’s fine. What say you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear J.T.,</p>
<p>Toe angle when squatting will is dependent on mobility of the hips, knees, and ankles (and everywhere in between). In my opinion, the reason that the “toes out” style of squatting was developed was to account for poor mobility in lifters; pointing the toes out allowed the lifter to get his knees out and avoid hip impingement and achieve proper positioning. If the lifter has the mobility to use more “toes in positions”, then they should do so. The toes won’t be straight forward, but just outside of forward. A lifter should never put them at 45 degrees with 30 degrees being the outer limit.</p>
<p>I’m starting to understand the mechanics of why the toes forward position improves “torque at the hip” (a phrase that Kelly Starrett uses on a regular basis). Reference <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-awareness/" target="_blank">this post</a>; it explains how a toes out position facilitates a collapsed arch (“navicular drop”) which shifts the positioning of the ankle and subsequently the knee and the hip. To put it simply, when the mobility exists to have the toes more forward and avoid the collapsed arch, the force is distributed more efficiently through each structure in the chain from the feet on up. It will specifically reduce medial stress on the knees, distribute more stress to the lateral thigh and hips, and produce better tightness in the posterior thigh and hip.</p>
<p>However, it’s all dependent on having the mobility to do it. That’s why I say mobility will dictate the foot angle “right now”. You may need to squat with your toes out today because your overall mobility isn’t capable of shoving the knees out effectively with the toes forward, but it is probably possible to subtly move them in over a few months of time (as you improve mobility).</p>
<p><strong>The End</strong></p>
<p>All right, it’s been fun. Some of you asked some smaller, quick questions on the Facebook Fan page, so I answered them in the thread. Have a good weekend. Is the Pro Bowl worth watching?</p>

  <p>[poll id=”36″]</p>
<p>The poll above will give some insight as to what style of training 70’s Big readers are distributed into. Weightlifters will be particularly interested in today’s topic while non-weightlifters will think it’s irrelevant, moot, or not understand it. I hope that the short analysis and discussion will spark some conversation related to mechanics as well as help the non-weightlifting crowd understand why the discussion exists.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>In a snatch or a clean, the barbell is pulled from the floor and moved upward because of the symphony of explosion from the knees and hips. The movements are more sensitive to technical changes that affect the mechanics, more so than strength lifts like the deadlift or press. This doesn’t mean weightlifting is on a pedestal with respect to powerlifting, it just means it’s very different. As with most sports, technique has evolved over time to improve efficiency, and this is evidenced by the <a href="http://www.chidlovski.net/liftup/l_recResult.asp?wname=Heavyweight&#038;ltype=2" target="_blank">progressive increase of world records over time</a> (link shows WR total in “heavyweight” category 1972 to present).</p>
<p>The United States is so large and weightlifting is such a relatively small sport here that there is not a solidified way to teach mechanics. One would assume that the governing body, USA Weightlifting, would dictate the style of teaching, coaching, programming, and mechanics, but in practice this isn’t the case. Other countries that are successful in weightlifting will have a given system that they utilize, and discrepancies are either invalidated with research or results. Some systems of coaching or programming that come to mind are Bulgarian, Russian, and Chinese.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>It’s well known that the U.S. does not perform well at the international level in weightlifting, and it’s fair to look at and discuss mechanics to gauge how they effect our success. If anything, it can help clarify what foreign resources say (i.e. Russian translations) to improve our understanding and efficacy.</p>
<p>Right now there has been discussion that pits two pulling methods against each other: the “jump and shrug” and the “catapult”. Succinctly, “jump and shrug” focuses on jumping or pulling the bar as high as possible while “catapult” (a misleading name, in my opinion) focuses on extension and a vigorous drop into the receiving position.</p>
<p><strong>“Jump and Shrug”</strong></p>
<p>This method is not a terrible point of emphasis, especially with beginners, yet it’s focus will limit intermediate to advanced level lifters — especially when the barbell weight significantly exceeds body weight. Jacob Tsypkin alluded to the fact that in the early weightlifting days, the bar wasn’t allowed to touch any part of the lifter’s body. As a result, the bar would need to be jumped as high as possible without contacting the body, and this is essentially the “jump and shrug” method. It would make sense if this lifting style developed from those rules constraints.</p>
<p>This method obviously puts an emphasis on jumping the bar as high as possible with the optional method of cuing a shrug at the top to help the upward momentum of the bar. I think that this “jump” (and not shrugging) mentality is very useful for teaching two populations: beginners and non-weightlifting athletes.</p>
<p>A trainee who has never lifted before will need to learn that snatching or cleaning is accomplished because the hips and legs make it so. Focusing on jumping the bar can help develop power ability, and one argument is that it could be a precursor to shifting into more advanced methods of weightlifting. If a trainee was going to have an emphasis on “jumping the bar” as high as possible, I think that they should only have this emphasis for one to six months. The first month could even be devoted to the power versions of the lifts. This methodology is viewed by advanced weightlifting coaches as counter productive since getting under the bar is difficult to teach to someone with a habit of trying to jump as high as possible (reference Travis Cooper’s experience in <a href="http://www.pendlayforum.com/showthread.php?t=5507" target="_blank">this thread</a>). <strong>My question to the rabbling quorum is: do you think that a period of time no longer than six months of a “jumping” emphasis is helpful or harmful to long term weightlifting skill?</strong></p>
<p>As for non-weightlifting athletes, their purpose of using variations of the Olympic lifts in their training is to have a loaded, explosive hip extension. I see a benefit in having an emphasis of jumping the bar in a power clean or power snatch for, say, a football player or soldier. The “extend and drop” emphasis (explained below) would detract from their goal in using the movement as it has a focus on only pulling as much as you need to in order to fully drop under the bar. In contrast, the “jump” method would put the emphasis on pulling the bar as high as possible, which would be what I want in trying to develop the hip extension capability of a non-weightlifter. <strong>Rabbling quorum: do you agree or disagree with this sentiment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Catapult” or “Extend and Drop”</strong></p>
<p>I admittedly have not ever talked with Don McCauley or seen his video explanations, so my analysis and viewpoints are limited in this discussion. I have talked with Pendlay about various mechanical topics as well as athletes and coaches who have learned from Pendlay and can typically learn and implement coaching/mechanics/programming topics pretty quickly, but bare with me if I explain something incorrectly. Remember that I’m trying to reach out to summarize for weightlifters and non-weightlifters.</p>
<p>I don’t like the term “catapult” as it implies that the contact of the bar with hips applies upward force on the bar. I think it’s because I saw someone using the term “boost” on GoHeavy.com — it bothered me a lot. In any case, I think it would be descriptive to readers to think of this as the “extend and drop”. This method requires much more attention to detail because it’s usually associated with a lifter handling large weights — significantly higher than their body weight. Mechanics will differ and change when the implement in a lifter’s hands weighs twice as much as they do. When squatting at least double body weight, if the bar moves forward or back one inch, the mechanical disadvantage is exponentially greater than if that error occurred with a much lighter weight. Now imagine that same sensitivity to mechanics but in a dynamic movement like the snatch or clean. Things get…difficult.</p>
<p>The basic premise of “extend and drop” would be to have an appropriate amount of “pull” — one that isn’t too little or too much — so that it times up perfectly with the vigorous and violent dropping of the athlete to get under the bar. A Pendlay forum user posted a link to this beautiful lift of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&#038;v=VFTdyubE-LM#t=69s" target="_blank">Blagoy Blagoev snatching 195kg at 90kg</a>, an incredible feat.</p>
<p>You can observe Oleg Perepetchenov in <a href="http://pendlayforum.com/showpost.php?p=29570&#038;postcount=1" target="_blank">this post on the Pendlay forum</a> exhibiting near perfect technique by getting to an extended hip position and not wasting any time before dropping (pictures below).</p>

<p>This is the epitome of efficiency, and this is what “extend and drop” teaches. I brainstormed some notes to help some of you see the specifics in how this method differentiates than the “jump” method or what you’ve been taught before.</p>
<p>Tspykin thought this clarifying bit of information would help understanding for the subsequent analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the execution of the “catapult,” or “extend and drop” method, there are three positions we are concerned with:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Position 1: Bar at high hang, sitting in the crease of the hip, with the shoulders back, hips over heels, knees slightly bent, and weight in heels. When moving into this position from the top, only the knees should break – if the bar slides down the thigh instead of staying in the crease of the hip, the lifter is flexing at the hip too much.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Position 2: Bar just below knee. At this position, the shoulders should be further ahead of the bar than at any other point in the lift. Three cues to check: heels (is the weight in the lifters heels,) knees (are the knees back and hamstrings stretched,) chest (is the chest over the bar and the back extended hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Position 3: The start position – not necessarily the lifters “set-up,” but specifically <em>the position the lifter is in at the moment the bar is separated from the floor</em>. The weight will be slightly towards the forefoot, the hips will be low, knees well ahead of the bar, and shoulders slightly ahead of the bar (though some of the best lifters actually start with the shoulders behind the bar, and their ability to pull like this may contribute to their superiority.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout the first phase of the pull off the ground, the balance of weight will be closer to the forefoot, but as the bar approaches the knees there is an emphasis in putting the weight in the heels. This not only effectively distributes the force application through musculature of the legs and hips, but it also is a preventative measure to prevent the weight from shifting forward (particularly when the barbell weighs significantly more than the lifter). Right before the second pull, or the violent hip extension, the weight will remain in the heels and the shoulders will be out over the bar; this effectively stretches the hamstrings. This position may have even been achieved as a result of the torso bowing forward (due to a more vertical starting position). This bowing would provide a subtle stretching of the hamstrings that would amplify their subsequent contraction that is about to occur (e.g. “stretch reflex”). Once the hip extension begins, the knees will rebend, which stretches the quadriceps and facilitates their immediate contraction to extend the knee that aids the “second pull” or explosive upward movement.</p>
<p>Again, the emphasis of keeping the weight in the heels and to “finish in the heels” will ensure that the correct muscular distribution is utilized for the force application (meaning that the stuff in the previous paragraph is happening in symphony instead of moving into a bad position). The “heels” emphasis will also avoid the lifter from “floating” or spending a superfluous amount of time at the apex of their pull (i.e. it prevents the lifter from getting airborne due to the violent extension). Over time the lifter will learn what amount of pull is required to not “over-pull” to avoid the “floating” problem. Lastly, the heels cue will facilitate a quick drop in to a squat position. “Heels” is a good cue for vertical-torso squatting styles; in this case the clean (front squat) and snatch (overhead squat) recovery. Since heels has been emphasized throughout the movement, there doesn’t have to be significant re-positioning of the feet as the lifter violently and quickly drops under the weight (with the assist of pulling themselves under the bar against the upward momentum).</p>
<p>The result is a beautifully efficient movement that we see above with Oleg and Blagoy. One thing that I left out (for simplicity) was the emphasis on “keeping the hands back” throughout the pull. Tsypkin pointed out that when Pendlay has his lifters pull off of blocks, they also initiate that movement with “push through the thighs” and “push bar back” (Pendlay can clarify the wording if need be). The emphasis on keeping the bar back is especially relevant when the weight is significantly greater than body weight because of mechanical efficiency. If ignorance or laziness allowed the bar to shift forward an inch during the movement, it would create or exacerbate any lever arms and make the rest of the lift (and positions throughout) more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The “jump” method is a rudimentary method of lifting that is easy to teach and is useful for power development in non-weightlifters. It’s quite clear that “extend and drop” is necessary for high level lifters lifting significant amounts of weight; the greater the weight, the greater the demand for supreme efficiency. The “jump” method is easy to teach to a beginner and can help develop their power, but is it debilitating to perfecting the “extend and drop” later? How would you “extend and drop” coaches develop the ‘hip extension power’ of an athlete who doesn’t inherently do it well from the start?</p>
<p>Note: Corrections will be made if needed.</p>

  <p>Keeping a training log is incredibly important for all athletes, but especially for a strength trainee. Athletes and bodybuilders need to record their progress, yet athletes often do what they’re told and bodybuilders run a style of programming for a while and gauge progress by pictures. But for the strength trainee, numbers mean everything. If you lift more this week than you did a year ago, then you are obviously stronger. A training log easily quantifies progress and removes speculation and confusion. If you don’t keep a training log, then this post should convince you to do so. If you already keep one, this post may give you some additional variables to record or some ideas on how to organize the log itself.</p>
<p><strong>What To Use</strong></p>
<p>Any notebook will do, but notebooks without spirals will hold together. Composition books works really well, but they can still fall apart. Use duct or electrical tape to hold them together over the years and avoid turning the covers inside out. Chris has been using the same spiral notebook for several years, and it looks like he’s had it since fifth grade. The front cover is completely ripped off, but he keeps it on top as if it were still attached. The papers are loose, but some how he keeps it together enough where he can reference his training sessions (I’ve requested a picture). I don’t recommend this. Below are two types of notebooks that will hold up better:</p>
<p><a href="/2012/01/2012-01-25_10-55-21_630.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6190" data-permalink="/blog/2012/01/logging-progress/2012-01-25_10-55-21_630/" data-orig-file="/2012/01/2012-01-25_10-55-21_630.jpg" data-orig-size="350,250" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;DROID BIONIC&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.6&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.082984&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="2012-01-25_10-55-21_630" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/01/2012-01-25_10-55-21_630.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/01/2012-01-25_10-55-21_630.jpg" src="/2012/01/2012-01-25_10-55-21_630.jpg" alt="" title="2012-01-25_10-55-21_630" width="350" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6190" /></a></p>
<p>The one on the left is a standard composition book, but with a leathery cover. The one on the right is a military field notebook; it was free and the cover is hard back and will hold up for a while. You can use whatever you want to, but I suggest picking something that will hold up for at least two years. My composition notebook above was used for at least 2.5 years.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p><strong>What Data To Record</strong></p>
<p>How much data to record will depend on the habit of keeping a log. If you haven’t kept one before, keep it easy and just write down the date, exercises, sets, and reps. It’s helpful to record all of the warm-up sets. This way you can calculate the tonnage (weight x reps x sets) of the entire workout, but this isn’t really necessary (I haven’t ever done it, but it would be useful for intermediate level lifters). More importantly you can see how you felt based on the warm-up sets you did. I found out a couple years ago that I needed more warm-up sets on upper body exercises than I did for lower. I also learned that I needed at least a single right below the first work set weight. Recording all the sets, including warm-ups can let you find this information.</p>
<p>If recording the lifting data is a habit, then be sure to add in your comments. If a set felt great, point that out. If it felt like shit, point that out too. The next section will give two examples of my personal logs and you’ll see some quick comments. I’ll also point out if I felt pain in a given structure (i.e. “L. medial elbow pain” or “R. proximal hip flexor”). This way problem areas can be addressed in mobbing and you or your coach can keep an eye out for technical problems when lifting. I also like to record the day, time, and location of where I’m training. I’ve trained all over the world and had good and bad sessions. When I randomly matched a PR in the snatch and almost PR’d a CJ in Australia, I want to remember that and see what circumstances helped that (a medium day two days before probably helped).</p>
<p>Lastly, I like to put comment on how I feel when I start the session. If I’m feeling a bit sluggish, I’ll point that out. If you’re not feeling great going into a session, then consider how much sleep you’re getting. If it’s not enough sleep and you feel tired, then you know what to do. Of course you can wait and make notes on many of these data points <em>if</em> they are abnormal. Pointing out that your first squat set is “regular” may be superfluous, but if you destroyed it or had a bitch of a set, point that out.</p>
<p><strong>How to Organize the Data</strong></p>
<p>You can do pretty much whatever works for you. I will caution you to ensure that the data is easy to read and reference. If you’re trying to see what you did last week, or three months ago, you don’t want to spend more than a few seconds looking. I like to draw a rectangle around the name of the lift or exercise; doing so makes it easy to distinguish the rows or columns of data. I also like to draw a line signifying the work set. You’ll see in my old log that line is horizontal since my data is aligned in a column. In the newer log, I just draw a slash to signify the beginning of the work set since it’s organized in a horizontal row.</p>

<p>In this new log I organize things in rows. You can see how I note how I feel at the top of the day. As you can see, I hadn’t squatted since before Thanksgiving (the clean and jerk-a-thon really fucked me up) and hadn’t trained since before Christmas, so I did a light day and then a light/medium day. I did Hammer Strength rowing because my quads were shaking so bad when I was trying to do barbell rows.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Everyone should have a training log. If nothing else it will display whether or not a given program has worked. Use a notebook that won’t fall apart easily, and organize the information so it’s easy to read and reference. Once the habit of recording information is established, start recording additional information that will help you guide your training and programming. Some other things you could record that I didn’t are mobility workouts or emphasis (I put those on the left page of my new workout) and food intake (I only record this if it’s abnormally low). If you carry your training log while you’re training, it will make you look like you have your shit together. Otherwise, record it as soon as you get home; otherwise you’ll forget. The more you record, the better of you’ll be later when trying to reference the information.</p>

  <p>Why do you train? Do you want to get stronger? Faster? Fit or healthy? Do you aim to compete in a particular sport like powerlifting, weightlifting, or catfish noodling? Wanting to get jehcked is good. Striving to get better in a sport is good. But, I ask you…what is best in life?</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6PQ6335puOc" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>So true. Let me ask you another question. When you step into the gym each training session, are you seething? Are you rabid? Are you shaking with hatred, wanting to kick the SHIT out of somebody or some…thing? No, you will never tap into your full power, young padawan. To develop your full destructive capabilities, you must know hate.</p>
<p>If your mom told you that you weren’t supposed to hate, it shouldn’t be hard to remember that your mom doesn’t deadlift 500 pounds. Your preacher can’t press 225 and your grandma can’t squat herself off the toilet. This isn’t a game. This is competition.</p>
<p>My friend Brent has used this mentality ever since I’ve known him. His unassuming method is to observe all kinds of lifters, coaches, and trainees on the internet. Inevitably there will be a good chunk of them who act like dickheads. They may even be stronger than him. And if they are, then beware. Brent’s hatred runs deep, right into the marrow of his bones. Instead of aiming vitriol at his targets, he files it in his brain’s Hate File. The Hate File is a rolodex of names, faces, videos, and…targets. I’ve learned that Brent will sit seemingly calm waiting for his next rep in training. But what’s going on is a whirlwind of accusations and speculation that results in a furious attempt.</p>
<p>_So-and-so doesn’t think I’m an athlete.</p>
<p>Fuck-face is squatting more than this right now.</p>
<p>Piece-of-shit is totalling 90% of me…I need to do much more…to EMBARRASS HIM._</p>
<p>Brent not only wants to be better than those he hates, he wants to <em>annihilate</em> them. But he’s not in a hurry. He knows that for some of his tangos, it will take time. And that’s why he places their file gently in his mind, thumbing it every so often to give himself a paper cut that reminds himself why he trains his dick off every day.</p>
<p>This. This is only one way to create Antagonistic Motivation. Strife, anger, and — god forbid — <em>challenge</em> are avoided in today’s society. What enemy can you find or create to challenge you to be better? When I was in high school, my early methods of spiking adrenaline consisted of imagining that a fullback was coming to block me in an iso. An “iso” is a football term for when the full back runs directly at the linebacker (me) to block him with the running back directly behind him. It’s a play dependent on the guts of the fullback and linebacker; who will deliver the bigger hit? Who will blow the other person up to make a play. I would think about this direct challenge to my honor right before squatting. I would routinely squat 425 to 445 for sets of five…beltless and in running shoes.</p>
<p>Is there a specific person or competitor that you will face in the future? Is there a hypothetical fiend on the enemy team who is aiming to make you fail? There is a quote that has percolated around the Special Operations community that reminds trainees of their true threat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somewhere a True Believer is training to kill you. He is training with minimal food or water, in austere conditions, training day and night. The only thing clean on him is his weapon and he made his web gear. He doesn’t worry about what workout to do – his ruck weighs what it weighs, his runs end when the enemy stops chasing him. This True Believer is not concerned about ‘how hard it is;’ he knows either he wins or dies. He doesn’t go home at 17:00, he is home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He knows only The Cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Still want to quit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you can’t bring yourself to hate, then personify the reason you should be training. In this case, a failure to put full effort into training can result in death, dismemberment, or torture in not only one’s self, but friends. There is no higher antagonistic motivation than knowing that your success effects the lives of other people.</p>
<p>Observe these strategies of Antagonistic Motivation and force a bout of introspection to figure out what you can put yourself against. You’re a desk jockey with no real life threatening challenge? Put yourself in situations of challenge. Aim to medal in your weight class at your next meet. Every day when you walk in the gym, think about how the guys in your weight class are training just as hard, if not harder than you. While they may be at a higher or lower level than you, you ignore those excuses. Instead, focus on your opponent, your challenger…your enemy. Will you let him train harder than you today? Will you let him beat you? You better fucking not.</p>

  <p>Here are a few push-up cues to use. Push-ups are important for females because they can significantly enhance the strength of the related musculature (anterior shoulder — delts/pecs — and triceps) which will augment the press and bench. They have more of an effect on girls within their first year or so of training, on taller or long-limbed girls, or girls with a weak upper body. Push-ups, of course, would be used in conjunction with strength training movements like the press, bench, and push-press (dips too, but if the push-ups aren’t great, chances are the dips aren’t possible).</p>

  <p>I hope everyone had a good week. It’s PR Friday so share your training PR’s or updates. This weekend also includes two of the last three relevant football games of the football year, so feel free to discuss (Justin Smith ftw).</p>
<p><strong>Operation Shankle</strong></p>
<p>Don’t forget that Donny Shankle will be making a real shot at making the Olympic team. My friend Jacob Tsypikup had the following to say about Donny: “I can say that he is a tremendous person to be around: a former Marine and veteran of the Iraq war, a fierce competitor, and inspirational merely through presence.” Donny has made countless sacrifices in order to be a weightlifter in the past ten years, and recently he’s even moved in with his coach Glenn Pendlay to save even more money. If you have a few doll hairs to spare, donate them to Donny; I know he will appreciate the support very much and make us proud.</p>

<p><strong>The Arnold Sport Festival</strong></p>
<p>I think that ‘the Arnold’ will be a really cool experience since it’s a celebration of competitive events. This will be the first “70’s Big Meet Up” that isn’t a workshop, so I suggest you attend. Mike and Chris will be competing in the raw powerlifting event, I’ll be going, and Brent will be going. It’s also where this year’s senior nationals are for USA Weightlifting, and Donny Shankle will be trying to make the Olympics (which will be very fun to watch). There’s also all kinds of cool shit like strongman events and a pro deadlift challenge (which will also be neat as shit). Plus at least 20 other sporting events and that doesn’t even consider the expo itself (where tons of “fitness” or sport celebrities will be present) and the second biggest bodybuilding show of the year.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about the cost of travel or hotels, then use the comments to see if anyone else near you is interested in going. We can help each other car pool or share hotel rooms and we can meet at certain events, restaurants, and bars. It will be tons of fun — I guarantee it. Because if it isn’t, I’ll make it fun by asking Derrick Poundstone what color his undies are.</p>

<p>The following question concerns borderline pointless banter regarding the SOPA blackout this week. Since I don’t want to spam you down, it’s merely optional reading.</p>

<p>I’m just confused as to the distinction you make between protesting about this, and the “Occupy” movement. Protesting is gay until you happen to agree with the cause?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear jayroc,</p>
<p>This is a valid question, even if I think it’s easy to see the distinction. First, I want to point out that I never said protesting was stupid, “gay”, or any such thing. When the “Occupy” stuff was dominating the news (and <a href="/blog/2011/11/take-it-ehsee/" target="_blank">when I mentioned it</a>), protesters were merely staying in spot without a goal. They weren’t doing anything and weren’t waiting for any specific thing to be done. They had a vague thing they wanted to be changed, but went about it like hippies who complain about “the man”. The SOPA protest had a very defined purpose: stop the bill(s) from passing. The end result is quantifiable. However, I considered it more of a way to raise awareness in order to stop the quantifiable result. You could argue the Occupy stuff raises awareness for…whatever you think they are raising awareness for, but when it was popular in the news they didn’t have a specific and quantifiable objective.</p>
<p>Lastly, all of the protesting I saw on January 18th helped people to go DO something in order to stop SOPA. Occupiers are occupying; that’s it. If I kidnap a famous person and am asked what my ransom is, and I say, “Ooga booga,” then how is anyone supposed to know what to do to get the person back? Realistically this is all moot anyway, because stopping SOPA was just a skirmish; <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/" target="_blank">the real war continues</a>. [/spoiler]</p>

<p>lets say the length of my femurs are the same as yours, and the length of my tibia was the same as yours,ie our legs are same proportions. HOWEVER…let’s also say that your torso was about 3 inches longer than mine. You LB squat, I HB squat. Would our back angles be similar? or am i leaving something out? physics is a little foreign to me at the moment (currently taking a physics class in college though). But I get that the difference between HB and LB has a lot to do with the back angle created by the bar placement. But i also get that the difference for most in placement of the bar is roughly 2-3 inches…. with that little of a difference, how is a persons anthropometry not the most important factor in bar placement/type of squat to use.</p>

<p>all that being said, I do understand that if i were to LB, that would shorten my moment arm even further, creating an even smaller angle at the hips thus amplifying the qualities in a good LB squat.

<p>IF, IF, IF, my logic is correct, and someone with a short torso is LB squatting, is it possible for that person to be TOO posteriorly dominant in the squat, therefore requiring assistance exercises for the quads, in the same vein that theoretically a HB squatter requires say an RDL to make up for the anterior dominance of the HB squat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> He’s asking about squatting mechanics with different torso lengths, his feeling of hip drive on HB squat with a short torso, and asking if someone can be posteriorily dominant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear criedthefox,</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why someone should be kicked in the dick, but asking a question about squatting mechanics isn’t one of them. First, if we had the same body dimensions, yet my torso was three inches longer, my squat would be vertical. Theoretically the bar still needs to remain over the middle of the foot, and a shorter torso will require more inclination to put the bar in that position than a longer torso, regardless if they are both considered longer torsos. The change in this hypothetical example may be negligible, but there would be a small degree of difference in angle. You can test this with a ruler. Place two dots on a piece of paper three inches from one another. The longer torso represents the tip of the 12 inch ruler while the shorter torso represents the six inch mark on the ruler. Make the bottom of the ruler sit on one dot, and lean the 12 inch tip so that it is vertical over the second dot; see how vertical it is? Now make the six inch mark learn so that it is vertical over the second dot; see how there is significant inclination. With other body dimensions constant, the longer torso will be more vertical, even if it’s only marginally longer.</p>
<p>Since you say you have a short torso, I can assume you have more forward inclination than someone with short femurs and a long torso. As a result, you will likely have more posterior chain involvement, especially if your mobility limits you from getting vertical. A lack of mobility in the ankles, knees, and hips can reduce how vertical someone is in a high bar, front, or overhead squat. Since you feel more posterior chain involvement, I will go ahead and assume that you don’t have great mobility (stretch your ankles and external hip rotators next squat session and see if it changes anything). To answer one of your questions: yes, the high bar squat can resemble a low bar squat if the person has long femurs and a short torso along with poor mobility. In contrast, a low bar squat can also have high bar mechanics if the person is too vertical.</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s possible that someone can be too dominant in their posterior chain, but highly unlikely. Instead, what we see more is that increasing quad strength can help the low bar a bit, but that doesn’t mean they were necessarily weak in the anterior. Since the posterior chain is much more important in athletics and movement (via hip extension), I’d rather see someone with a bias towards the posterior as it signifies solid hip and lower back structure as well as strength. There are many successful athletes that have gotten by with weak posterior chains; the question is whether or not it promoted specific injuries more than had their posterior chain been stronger. However, if someone was interested in Olympic weightlifting and primarily low bar squatted, then they will need some kind of vertical squatting to develop their “anterior chain” to be successful. When I was transitioning into weightlifting, I squatted around 500 low bar and my first few front squat sessions were around 315 to 335, yet I worked it up to around 400×2 (to give you an example).</p>

<p>I’ve just added light RDL’s (135#) to my programming as a assitance lift (I’m doing 5/3/1) and trying to use correct form based on resoures such as 70sBig and Rip’s video on the SS website.</p>

<p>My problem is I feel I am hitting the hamstring on the longer leg a lot more than the shorter leg.

Is this approach OK? Any better ideas?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d assume that it’s best to spread the load evenly across both legs/hamstrings as much as possible, but on the other hand, perhaps when I am squatting and deadlifting this same uneven distrubution of load is occuring and therefore the “dominant”(?) hamstring needs to be stronger? Is that crazy talk??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Josh,</p>
<p>Since one of your legs is longer — which isn’t uncommon — you did well to try and distribute the load. However, it probably isn’t evenly distributing that load since you still have a short leg. You’re merely finding a new foot position that makes the structures feel as if they are trained evenly. Instead, find a shim that is as close to the difference in leg length as possible under the shorter leg. That way your shorter leg will be even with the longer leg and you can use a normal stance. At Rip’s gym we used pieces of rubber floor matting (they were probably 18″x18″x3/4″). You typically want the mat to be at least twice the surface area of your foot so it doesn’t slide on the floor as you’re lifting (which will result in either death or a torn scrote). You should probably use it on squat and deadlift too, since those will be even more affected by your leg difference. The worst case scenario is that you load your hips and spine weird over time and develop tightness in one side of your back.</p>
<p>Reader <em>track</em> also pointed out that leg length differences can also represent pelvic weirdness (rotation, tilt, etc.) and he recommended a chiropractor. This is a good idea to confirm if your legs are different sizes or if it’s a pelvic difference.</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2012/01/the-repeated-bout-effect/#comment-22157" target="_blank">Maslow asks:</a></a></em></p>
<p>So say you are on a 3- or 4-day per week program. You get extremely sore and are experienced enough to know that you absolutely will not be able to work through it to complete your scheduled training, so you do a quick light day. Do you return to the gym the very next day to attempt your scheduled work from the day before, or take a day off?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Maslow,</p>
<p>I’d probably take a day off and consider making the next training day lighter than it was supposed to be. If you’re just sore, then think about why. Not enough protein and not hydrated well? Not good sleep? Just came back from a layoff (if this is it, then you did too much too soon and need to use the easy progression up)? Diagnose why. If you are just mysteriously sore, then you probably have too much shit in your program. If you’re on a TM, and are mysteriously sore, then look at the volume day(s). Soreness is information that is relevant to track in your log, and if you don’t know why it’s there then you may be doing too much.</p>
<p>Note that the “quick light day” probably should occur on a normal training day as opposed to doing it on your rest day. In other words, I probably wouldn’t have you do this:</p>
<p>Training Day</p>
<p>Normal rest day — fucking sore, go to gym and do light stuff</p>
<p>Instead, it would be this:</p>
<p>Training day</p>
<p>Normal rest day — note overwhelming soreness</p>
<p>Normal training day — adjust session to account for overwhelming soreness. This means if you didn’t plan to squat, and your quads or groin are blown up, then do some light squats. If you were supposed to squat heavy, warm up and if you’re structures are too damaged to lift heavy then hit some light squats and move on.</p>

<p>If you’re going to have a high tempo European vacation, then don’t worry about extensive training. Hit some push-ups, pull-ups, or body weight squats when you can, but don’t take significant time from seeing Europe in order to “train”. It’s still just body weight shit and it won’t be accomplishing a whole lot (unless muscular endurance is a goal, but still you shouldn’t sacrifice seeing Europe for that). If you have a lazy type trip (where you aren’t bouncing from city to city) and are intending on training in some cool places outdoors, you could do sprints, plyo jumps, and burpees (note that plyo jumps are NOT conditioning).</p>
<p>But your question was for your return. If you primarily like to lift with some conditioning added in (which is my assumption?), there’s not reason you can’t lift on that first week back. However, as the <a href="/blog/2012/01/the-repeated-bout-effect/" target="_blank">Repeated Bout Effect</a> post suggested, just do a light day. Two or three sets of five with warm-up weight with squat, press, and maybe deadlift will give you a nice little stress that won’t be damaging. Then if you want you could do some conditioning after that (since a few light sets should only take 15 or 20 minutes). The second session two days later can be similar, but a bit heavier weights, and the third can be similar with medium weights. The following week you should be good to work up to a bit under where you left off, then the second workout of the second week should be where you left off. If you do it that way, you’ll feel revitalized through the progression instead of feeling like ten pounds of pounded asshole.</p>
<p>Also, since you won’t have a systemic lifting stress during your vacation, your metabolism will receive a nice spike after that first lifting session. You’ll feel better if you do it this way. Contrast that with doing too much and you’ll only depress your system, which is an invitation to the gout. Yeah, you’ll contract the gout; it’s weird, I dunno.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andre C. asks:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me as sedentary people age they complain more about soreness throughout thier bodies, could the repeated bout effect be working here at their level of deconditioning causing soreness with extremely low work intensity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because sedentary people are adapted to very little. As they age, they further adapt to a lack of stress. Compound that with a shitty diet and the downward health spiral continues. The Repeated Bout Effect just states that doing a bit of work will produce an adaptation so that subsequent work doesn’t induce as much soreness. The aging sedentary person isn’t doing anything whatosever, therefore anything they do will make them sore. I wouldn’t say the Repeated Bout Effect is relevant, since it more so relates to a purposeful act of training, but we could say that something more than what they are adapted to is the first step of the Repeated Bout Effect. In other words, climbing three flights of stairs induces a stress the sedentary/lazy person isn’t adapted to that makes them sore, but technically — as with all stresses — it’s something that the body will try to adapt to so that the next time they do it, it will be easier and cause less damage.</p>
<p>Instead, think in terms of what the person’s current state of adaptation is with respect to the stress they impart on their body. “Stress” can also be “a lack of stress”. This is why a sedentary or older person’s muscles atrophy and bones decrease in density; those structures aren’t experiencing a mechanical stress that would maintain or increase their strength and density, so they weaken because of not receiving stress. That’s why it’s so important for old people to exercise. For my grandma, exercising might be standing up and sitting down ten times in a row. For others, it might be walking for ten minutes. When the application of stress stops, so does any positive adaptation.</p>

  <p>Shawn had about a month off from training. You know what that asshole did on squats in his first session back? 135 for 5; 185 for 5; 225 for 5; 275 for 5; 315 for 3; 225 for 10; (next two sets are front squat) 135 for 10; 135 for 6 — that’s a shit-load of work. His normal work sets last year before the holiday were about 325 (he’s using 5/3/1; front squats are his assistance work). His structures weren’t adapted to doing any squats, and he subjected them to stress that was greater than what they could have handled before the layoff even occurred.</p>
<p>Sure, it was dumb. But calling Shawn an idiot relentlessly isn’t going to help his crippling soreness. He told me, “Dude, I am so fucking sore. I had to FALL onto the toilet seat to take a shit earlier.” Instead, I gave him advice on what to do in his next training session to alleviate that soreness. In the research this is called The Repeated Bout Effect and it’s used to reduce Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS).</p>
<p><a href="/2012/01/bodyisready.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6163" data-permalink="/blog/2012/01/the-repeated-bout-effect/bodyisready/" data-orig-file="/2012/01/bodyisready.jpg" data-orig-size="225,224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bodyisready" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/01/bodyisready.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/01/bodyisready.jpg" src="/2012/01/bodyisready.jpg" alt="" title="bodyisready" width="225" height="224" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6163" /></a></p>
<p>DOMS occurs as a result of doing something that the structures aren’t adapted to. This could include a significant change in volume and intensity, or it could occur from performing a new movement using structures through a different range of motion (ROM). For example, a CrossFitter would experience higher levels of soreness if they started squatting 3×5 at heavier weights than they handle in their met-cons. Conversely, a lifter would experience high levels of soreness if they tried a high repetition CrossFit met-con after being adapted to low repetition lifting (even more so since CrossFit will typically include new or different movements from the lifter’s normal training repertoire). DOMS typically peaks 24 to 48 hours after a bout of exercise. My personal experience and opinion is that the more adapted you are, the shorter the process to achieve peak soreness and subsequent loss of soreness (1).</p>
<p>For me, I can feel the soreness within 12 to 18 hours, and peak soreness occurs 18 to 24 before decreasing. When I was younger and doing bodybuilding stuff, I would routinely hit a peak of soreness at 48 hours. This may be due to a lack of adaptation or strength, but it could also be due to the fact that I did a lot more isolation work for the “body parts” that I was working that day as opposed to the lesser amount of work places on the specific muscles nowadays when I train my whole body each session.</p>
<p>The Repeated Bout Effect states that “subsequent bouts of the same exercise, repeated within several days to several months, do not produce as much damage as the first bout” (4). You can look at that from two perspectives. The first is that by doing very low intensity work (&lt;50%) for a session, subsequent sessions will not produce as much DOMS (even up to 6 weeks after the initial bout of low-intensity work). The second is that if DOMS exists, then using some low-intensity work with the same muscles can help reduce their soreness. It&rsquo;s even shown that this adaptive effect is conferred to other muscles (3), but my assumption is that they are used in synergy with or stabilize the joints and structures of the movement performed (i.e. the external hip rotators may not apply hip extension in a movement, but their action will help stabilize the hip during the movement).</p>
<p>If we look at The Repeated Bout Effect as a preventative measure, then we would have begin our reintroduction to lifting after a layoff with a light day (something that I’ve suggested numerous times on this site). If we look at it as a treatment to crippling soreness — like Shawn’s situation above — then we can drop some light work into our next training session. Shawn will be training today — 48 hours after the squatting session. He’s scheduled to press with pressing assistance, yet I suggested that he squat the following: 135x5x2, 185×5 for one or two sets. This obviously doesn’t provide a stress to grow stronger, yet it provides a stress nonetheless via The Repeated Bout Effect. The research has observed the circumstances in which it can help alleviate soreness, yet the mechanism of <em>how</em> it occurs isn’t fully understood and it’s considered a phenomena. Some theories include neural, connective tissue or cellular adaptations as well as adaptation in excitation-contraction coupling or adaptation in the inflammatory response (2).</p>
<p>The trainee only needs to know how to prevent soreness since soreness can literally make it hard to take a shit, but it can also be debilitating to performance in the following training sessions. If you have extreme soreness due to a new movement or a change in work, then drop in some light exercises in a medium repetition scheme. Common soreness areas are the quads and groin from squats, proximal biceps tendon from dips, hamstrings from RDLs, or lumbar spine from deadlift (typically associated with severe rounding of the back). Muscles that are sore from squats or should just be worked with light squats, yet the other areas can be worked with related exercises. Light dumbbell flyes or push-ups could alleviate soreness in the upper body, and round back extensions (RBEs) or reverse hypers are best to use for the lumbar spine. Light good mornings, deadlifts, and RDLs could be used for hamstrings. Observant trainees will note that these exercises are often used in powerlifting programs as a preventative measure to alleviate soreness (especially in Russian programming — thanks Briskin).</p>
<p>Utilize these same methods if you have a training stoppage due to a meet, holidays, travelling, sickness, or injury, but use them in a light day and gradually increase the stress. I suggest taking a week and using Light-Medium-Moderate training days. Training isn’t a race; the more you can prevent injuries or overreaching, the more success you’ll have over a longer amount of time.</p>

  <p>_The following was what loaded if you tried to access the site on January 18th, 2012. I saw some complainers whining that protesting was gay or that it didn’t accomplish anything. In this case, it did quite a lot. It raised awareness of a terrible bill that would have repercussions that the whiners would not enjoy if it passes. This isn’t to say that copyright protection isn’t important, because it is. There probably needs to be better legislation but SOPA was not it. In any case, if you joined the fight against SOPA, thank you; It’s rare that common folk will get together and rabble-rabble until they are heard.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/pipa-support-collapses-with-13-new-opponents-in-senate.ars" target="_blank">At least 18 senators now oppose the bill</a> now since the protests._</p>
<p><strong>If SOPA were to pass, you would load this website only to find out it was blocked. Please read why.</strong></p>
<p>Today 70sBig.com is participating in the SOPA/PIPA boycott. The “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act" target="_blank">Stop Online Piracy Act</a>” and “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act" target="_blank">PROTECT IP Act</a>” are respectively House and Senate bills that falsely aim to reduce online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods. In actuality this legislation invites Internet security risks, threatens online speech, hampers Internet innovation, bans or censors any website, and reduces our rights we have as internet users.</p>
<p>There’s a reason that other websites like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> are participating in today’s boycott: the bills destroy every free right we have as internet users. Today 70’s Big wants to bring this to your attention so that you understand the implications of the bills and arm you with fire power in how we can help prevent them from passing. If we fail, this website (and many others) may be altered or banned from you.</p>
<p>First I want to share what a friend had to say about the bills. He works in and is knowledgeable about the information security field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SOPA is the digital equivalent of politicians trying to slowly destroy the fundamental protections of our Bill of Rights through the guise of fear mongering that they’ve been doing with everything from organized crime to domestic terrorism. They market this supposed metastasis of problems with the internet such as digital crime and use it to say, “We need to control this and we’ll do it by basically taking your rights away, even if you don’t know it.” It’s humorous that they think they will solve problems because SOPA’s policies, when put into an actual technical implementation, will make it harder to distinguish the differences between their policy enforcement at network border gateways, real problems that service providers are having, or actual criminal attempts to subvert security and/or availability of network services. This is just one example of the bullshit SOPA presents and represents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophically, we’d be giving up our fundamental rights to do as we please on the internet. If I wanted someone telling me what I can or can’t do on the internet, I’d move to China, North Korea, or somewhere in the Middle East.</p>
