  <p>I spent most of the Mondays in September and October talking about ways to get your lady friend into lifting weights. The goal wasn’t necessarily to brain wash her and turn her into a lifter, but to teach and implement quality barbell training and high intensity conditioning. Today I want to talk about transitioning from the “slow lifts” to the Olympic lifts. This will not be approached from the perspective of a weightlifter with the result of having a girl compete in weightlifting (although that’s cool). Instead, we’re merely going to add things to the program to have a general strength and conditioning focus that is fun.</p>
<p>By this time the lady in question will understand the utility in lifting and enjoy it. If she didn’t have any experience with lifting, it may be a good idea to get about half a year of lifting before worrying about this transition. Even if the gal has an athletic background, mastering the intricacies of body position while lifting can take time (every girl won’t be like <a href="/blog/2010/12/how-to-press-your-girlfriend/" target="_blank">Eva Twardokens</a> or <a href="/blog/2012/01/an-aggressive-competitor/" target="_blank">Lindsay Taylor</a>). Pre-existing musculature, strength, coordination, injuries, and skill will dictate when the transition should happen, but if there is no lifting history and athletic history is limited to high school, then don’t rush it. Remember, the idea with gals who are skeptical of lifting is to progress them slowly yet consistently. In order to shift into the snatch and clean and jerk, here are some preliminary lifts to use for a while to ease the transition.</p>
<p><strong>The Front Squat</strong></p>
<p>The first amendment to a standard program is to throw in front squats about once a week. If she was already high barring, then this won’t be a big change, but if she was low barring this will help quite a bit. I’ve seen the front squat solidify positioning in the LB squat and develop quadriceps musculature faster than the low bar. Even more important is that it teaches a good rack position. The elbows should be up and in, and the bar can rest back in the fingers (as opposed to gripping the bar in the fists). Note that the elbows should be “in”; this puts the shoulder in external rotation to allow a good “chest up” position with the shoulders “back and down” in their socket. If the elbows are in, then she won’t need to think about any of that, but will need to maintain the “chest to chin” cue I’ve mentioned here before. The squat itself has the same cues as a high bar squat: “shove the knees out” and “heels out of the bottom” (shortened to “knees out” and “heels”). The rack position consists of passive cues that she shouldn’t have to think about (but should be corrected from day one) while the “knees” and “heels” cues are active cues that typically need emphasis while the movement occurs. The following position is a pretty good rack position, although I’d see if she can bring them “in” or closer together a little more.</p>

<p>Use the front squat every week, but not exclusively. If there are three training sessions a week, make one a front squat session. If there are only two sessions, then front squat on one of them. If high bar is already being used, consider front squatting before or after the HB squat on a volume-type day to teach the rack position.</p>

<p><strong>The Push-Press</strong></p>
<p>The push-press can act as the intermediary between the regular standing press and the jerk. It also is a programming boost to pressing strength as it will allow more weight to be handled through a similar range of motion. The rack position in this movement is slightly different than the front squat, but it’s imperative to get it right. The grip may have to be more narrow than the front squat grip, yet it can be a finger width or two wider than the press grip (but no wider; the grip-width mechanics of the press still apply in the push-press). If possible, she can have more hand contact on the bar and even wrapping her fingers, <em>but this is secondary to having the bar sit on her deltoids and upper chest</em>. The bar <em>must</em> have as much surface area contact as possible on the anterior shoulders so that the dip/drive applied from the legs and hips travels through the torso and into the bar instead of through the torso, through the shoulders, down the arms, through the elbows and wrists, through the hands, and <em>then</em> into the bar. It’s okay to have the elbows pointed forward in a push-press rack like they are in a front squat rack. Just like in the jerk, the mechanics in the bottom range of motion are irrelevant because the power of the legs and hips is what actually moves the bar off the shoulders. The goal is to have a solid rack position to to drive the bar off the shoulders, and then smoothly lock it out with press mechanics (i.e. don’t internally rotate). All of the rack positions for the push-press on google are terrible (male or female), but I found one that is pretty good (see below). The fact that it looks similar to the front squat rack is fine. The fact that it’s only being done with 60kg is embarrassing.</p>

<p><strong>The Hang Power Clean</strong></p>
<p>Many Olympic lifting coaches hate the idea of jumping the bar upward, yet I’ve seen more novices and kids stand up with a bar and sit down to only become good at nothing. I’m just being a dickhead, but I believe that there is utility in teaching a powerful vertical jump in the Olympic movements early on as it will instill powerful pulls to move the bar up (the getting under it can come later). Non-Olympic lifters will benefit most from “jumping the bar” up as well as it helps improve their power more than focusing on getting under the bar. To finish this tangent, “getting under the bar” is a more advanced thing to worry about.</p>
<p>For someone who hasn’t done a quality power clean, this “jumping” idea is important. I like to use Rippetoe’s power clean teaching method because it’s absurdly simple and effective with beginners. I’ve taught an uncoordinated 65 year old cyclist how to power clean in less than five minutes (a lovable friend of ours in Texas; I won’t speak for Rip, but this was an accomplishment). In any case, that teaching method is in the <em>Starting Strength</em> books and is probably in some videos online (the DVD Rip sells has it, and it teaches it better than the book). The power clean is just a jump and a catch. Nothing more. Jump the bar to the shoulders. Very, very simple.</p>
<p>However, instead of doing the full progression, we’re just going to work with the “jumping position”, the jump, and the catch. Sometimes there aren’t bumper plates in a gym. Other gyms have them, but not any that are lighter than 25lbs (for 95 total lbs). The hang power clean will let the girl learn how to do the jump effectively with a weight that is easy to learn with. All she has to do is push her hips back to get to the jumping position, jump, and catch it on the shoulders (see image below). Note that in the “jumping position”, the shoulders are in front of the bar; this is important for stretching the hamstrings and utilizing them effectively in the jump.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/01/power-clean-techniques.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6139" data-permalink="/blog/2012/01/the-transition/power-clean-techniques-2/" data-orig-file="/2012/01/power-clean-techniques.jpg" data-orig-size="297,140" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="power-clean-techniques" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/01/power-clean-techniques.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/01/power-clean-techniques.jpg" src="/2012/01/power-clean-techniques.jpg" alt="" title="power-clean-techniques" width="297" height="140" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6139" /></a></p>
<p>In the first few sessions, focus on a vertical jump and the receiving position. The feet placement isn’t a big deal, but avoid allowing her to sprawl. If she’s been lifting for half a year and has done front squats and push-press, I’d be willing to bet she won’t sprawl the feet out or have much difficulty with the rack position. Remember that the front squat teaches the rack position and the push-press gets her comfortable with things flying past her face (giggity). Assuming that the jump and rack positions are solid, then say, “hands and feet together” for a cue to make the rack position and feet hitting the floor occur at the same time. This will speed up the rack and make it look snappy. Snappiness is important for female lifters because they often lack the aggressive speed needed for solid Olympic weightlifting.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>By using the front squat, push-press, and hang power clean, your lady lifter will not get overloaded with trying to several motor pathways at once. Don’t implement them all at the same time. The front squat and push-press can often begin together, but weight for her to get comfortable on the front squat before messing with the hang power clean. While it may be possible to jump right into the snatch and clean and jerk, by allowing for a steady progression to learn pieces of the movements, you’ll ensure a successful transition. Set your lady up for success instead of failure and she’ll love and adhere to lifting better than constantly failing.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t have confirmation on this, but apparently Allison Bishop (AllisonNYC for you CF vets) has allegedly committed to doing a max effort clean and jerk in a bikini if Donny Shankle gets to his fundraising goal (read the first part of <a href="/blog/2012/01/qa-13/" target="_blank">this post</a>). Now let’s get on with the bloody Q&amp;A, eh?</p>

<p>This week’s collection of articles has me all worried about balanced ham/quad development. If I look in the mirror I’d say I’m pretty quad dominant, however I just LBBS my way up to 405# before switching back to HBBS. If I’m doing all of the following once a week – HBBS, front squat, snatch, C&amp;J, deadlift – should I be doing some RDLs as well?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear sdanleyjr,</p>
<p>I’m a huge proponent of RDL’s, especially for lifters who aren’t in the ‘later intermediate stages’ and beyond. I’d even to venture and say that the RDL’s will be better for your programming than the deadlifts — CRAZY TALK. It looks like you’re training for weightlifting, and heavy deadlifts are going to require significant local and systemic recovery. Not only are you using your limited supply of recovery credits on the expensive deadlift, but you may be inhibiting the clean, snatch, or squat workouts that occur after the deadlifting (even if they are the following week). If you’re primarily training to be a weightlifter, you’ll get good hamstring and lumbar musculature work out of the RDL and still have some zing for the rest of your program.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2012/01/qa-13/#comment-21882" target="_blank"><em>jaygreenshirt asks:</em></a></p>
<p>At the Chicago lifting seminar you discussed the phenomenon of one’s hamstrings sputtering during a heavy deadlift (you referred to it as ‘tut-tut-tut’). I can’t remember your explanation on this and was hoping you could explain it on the site. I recently pulled a one rep max deadlift and my hamstrings were tut-tut-tutting like The Little Engine That Could.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear jaygreenshirt,</p>
<p>It’s awesome to hear from you. For everyone else, Jay was one of two Jays at the Chicago workshop, and when I said the name “Jay”, my friend Jay S. kept saying, “What?” So I resorted to calling this Jay “Jay Green Shirt” since he was wearing a green shirt. Apparently Ellee still has him saved as that in her phone.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a good question. The “tut-tut-tut” sputtering that occurs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9lj-DI7IEE" target="_blank">when locking out heavy deadlifts</a> (watch the second rep at 625) is a neurological result of not being adapted to high levels of tension in the hamstrings. Assuming good mechanics (that would maintain hamstring tension), the intrafusal muscle fibers (in this case, the golgi tendon organ) of the hamstring are monitoring levels of tension in the muscle. If tension is too high, then the GTO will essentially shut the muscle off to prevent injury. Your conscious effort to pull the weight forces a resuming in the contraction, or “turning the muscle back on”. The GTO then senses high levels of tension and turns it off again. This back-and-forth could occur several times and feels like a stuttering lockout that I sum up as a “tut-tut-tut” (usually I mimic the move as I say it in a workshop).</p>
<p>So what the FUCK does all of that mean? You are relatively unadapted to the higher levels of tension that you were imparting on the muscle and it’s associated nerve functioning. How can this be fixed? Rack pulls are usually the go-to method of improving that ability to experience high tension. If you watched the linked video above of Chris first couple reps at a 600+ pounds, you can see it occur. Shortly after that I had him do rack pulls and he never had those tension issues again (see below for Chris pulling 655×2 the other day). RDL’s are also another good way to improve the hamstring’s ability to experience tension. The weight won’t be as heavy, yet the different mechanics will still stretch the hamstring and make it contract under tension. Regularly using both of these lifts will eradicate the tut-tut, yet also getting more reps with higher intensity deadlifts will help in the short term as well.</p>

<p>So I find myself in a weird spot where my work sets for dead and squat are the same and I am increasing them at the same rate. I don’t think I could go for increasing my dead by any more than 5lbs a week that I am already doing. I know these two weights should not be equal but it was just a fluke from my LP that they ended up near each other when I entered the TM programming. Should I just not worry about it and let the dead naturally progress past my squat as I stall or slow at that lift or should I take steps to actively move the deadlift weight past the squat weight? I am already using RDLs on my assistance day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear nobodystopsdblob,</p>
<p>The first thing I’d have you do is use a triple on Intensity Day for deadlift. It’s also possible that deadlifting every week is going to peter out soon. The TM E-book Part 2 will help that.</p>

<p>[Related to the Olympics:] What determines the number of competitors we are allowed to send? What determines the number of women competitors at 2 and the men at 1?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear casanoah,</p>
<p>Short answer is performance. It’s an objective and quantifiable method determined by the USOC. Here’s a paste of what cassio598 responded with:</p>
<p>The number of slots for each country is determined by their athletes’ performances at the previous 2 world championships, and additionally by performance at their continental qualifier. Men’s country qualifying is separate from women’s.</p>
<p>At the world championships, each country is represented by a team of up to 6, and their totals are added up for a team score, and the summed across the two meets. The top 6 mens team scores earn 6 slots for their country, 7-12 earn 5, 13-18 earn 4, 19-24 earn 3. Because there are fewer weight classes for women, there are fewer slots available, and fewer teams to earn them. The top 9 womens teams earn 4 slots, 10-16 earn 3, and 17-21 earn 2. Presumably the women earned their 2 slots this way.</p>
<p>In addition to the qualification slots earned at the world championships, countries can earn a single slot by placing high enough, again as a team, in their continental qualifying event, which for the US is the Pan American Championship. The US Men must finish in the top 7 teams in order to earn 1 slot in the Olympics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thoughts on back-off sets in an LP for swolertrophy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This method definitely can work; we’ve seen it work in the Greyskull Linear Progression. The difference is in the GSLP, the third set of five is taken for reps. In the last year, I have experimented with doing a backoff set for reps or several backoff rest-pause sets (discussed in the TM E-book Part 1). The regular backoff merely drops some weight and gets a set with at least 8 to 12 reps. The rest-pause method lowers the weight and hits a set of about 8, rests about 15 seconds (but no more than 30), hits another set for reps (hopefully at least 8), and then rests another 15 seconds before hitting a third, and final, set for reps. 8 reps is an arbitrary number but fits very well in the “hypertrophy rep scheme”. The reps per set will probably depreciate over the three rest-pause sets, and that’s fine. While getting the reps AT LEAST to six and more like 8 reps will help, the significant stressor here is the short rest periods. Higher reps and short rest periods are what help grow muscle bodybuilding style.</p>
<p>Either of these methods can also count as muscular endurance work, especially for lifters who have been primarily messing with triples or fives in their programming. They could also be used in “fat loss” type programs along with a good diet and some high intensity conditioning.</p>

<p><em>Roy asks:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Question for you about dead lifting, strength and elbow pain. I’ve found that that the mixed grip helps me lift significantly more weight than the double overhand grip does, but the tradeoff seems to be elbow pain to the side that goes under the bar (in this case the right elbow). I read somewhere that it has to do with a compromised shoulder position. Thoughts on using the mixed grip? The elbow pain / shoulder position?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Roy,</p>
<p>The alternated grip works better because your hands are torquing the bar in opposite directions. A non-hook double overhand grip applies torque to the bar so that it rotates towards the end of your fingers. The alternated grip still applies torque towards your fingers, but since you’re applying that rotational force forward and backward, it balances out and creates friction in the hands to hold onto the bar easier. Neato, huh.</p>
<p>I’ve already confirmed that your right arm is the one that is supinated (or underhand) in your alternate grip, and there are two things that could be causing elbow pain. The first is if you are hypermobile in the elbow joint. Usually guys don’t have laxity in their joints, but it’s possible to have a bit of a hyper-extension in the elbow — even when pulling a deadlift. I don’t remember seeing any laxity in your joints in the time that we talked (I know Roy) or trained together, so let’s move onto the second thing.</p>
<p>Your concern over shoulder inflexibility is most likely the case (I do remember some inflexibility in your movement). When the forearm is supinated for the underhand grip, the shoulder is put into external rotation. This contracts the external rotators and stretches the internal rotators. If your internal rotators are tight (as the commonly are in today’s desk jockey warrior society), then the externally rotated shoulder won’t be in a very good position. It also maybe possible that your external rotators or thoracic spine are tight. Tell Shana (his coach) that you need to “mob” your shoulder with various external rotation positions (she’ll know what to do). For the rest of you, the <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-211365-the-simple-five-way-shoulder.html" target="_blank">five-way shoulder</a> is a good place to start. Also, Roy, use the “peanut”, or lacrosse balls taped together and work on your thoracic spine. If you have bad posture (which would be indicative of your problem), work on lifting the chest towards your chin a little bit during the day. Every day you should do at least one stretch for your internal rotation (which would be a stretch that puts you in external rotation) as well as rolling your thoracic spine with lacrosse balls (Shana will know some variations of how to hit the areas medial to your scapula, too). Have fun, mate.</p>
<p>All right, that was jolly fun. If a lot of you guys are gonna be home for the NFL playoffs, maybe we should get a chat room going during the games? Have a solid weekend.</p>

  <p>Readers occasionally ask me what the 70’s Big’s “official stance” on steroids is. That boils down to what my stance is, albeit with the opinion of some friends. We have talked about steroids on this website in the past (the first two links were posted by me, the last two posted by Gant):</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2010/02/id-like-a-word-with-you/" target="_blank">One</a></p>
<p><a href="/blog/2010/09/football-and-steroids-do-you-care/" target="_blank">Two</a></p>
<p><a href="/blog/2009/12/steroids/" target="_blank">Three</a></p>
<p><a href="/blog/2010/02/putting-the-cart-before-the-horse%E2%80%94steroid-qa/" target="_blank">Four</a></p>
<p>For the sake of discussion, when I say “steroids” in this post, I’m referring to steroids and anabolic type compounds — the whole gamut of stuff that enhance performance via hormonal manipulation.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I was staunchly against steroids. Nowadays, I don’t really give a shit. If someone wants to use them, then it doesn’t bother me. And for the record, I think that it’s their right to decide if they want to or not. I haven’t ever used steroids, do not currently, and won’t in the future any time soon. I don’t have a problem with guys around the age of 35 to 40 and up supplementing a little bit of testosterone to stave off negative health effects (though I currently don’t have research to link to support this idea). Technically, I don’t have a problem with anyone currently using steroids. But when someone asks me, “Should I use steroids?” my answer is always the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you do everything in the realm of training consistently including, but not limited to, eating right, regularly training, mobbing, sleeping right, etc.?</li>
</ol>
<p>If not, then it’s clear there are things to address that could improve your goals, whatever those goals are.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If you make the decision to use steroids, then do so with an informed opinion. Learn as much as you can from people who do it right. Don’t learn from some dickhead at the local Gold’s. Don’t learn from some guy on the internet who has gotten results from them. Learn from someone who has done it properly and has learned from or actually is a knowledgeable person that you can actually trust. This person should be able to explain the ‘why’, ‘how’, and ‘what’ about steroids. Changing the hormones in your body is serious business, and I wouldn’t want you to have something bad occur because of negligence or ignorance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I know very little about steroids. In every book I write, I clarify that I don’t have experience in coaching anybody that uses them, and I’ve already pointed out how I don’t have any experience taking them (though I’ve been accused of it at various points in the last 8 years). I also never knew a simple, direct source to learn about steroids basics. Every resource either seems to be chemistry related that is a bit over my “steroid knowledge” head, or it’s forum-type information saying “use this and this, it’ll work like a charm”. However, now there is such a source of information in the <em><a href="http://strengthvillain.myshopify.com/collections/ebooks" target="_blank">Beginner’s Guide to Steroids</a></em> by Brent Larson at <a href="http://strengthvillain.com" target="_blank">Strength Villain</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://strengthvillain.myshopify.com/collections/ebooks"><img data-attachment-id="6122" data-permalink="/blog/2012/01/steroids-2/sv_steroids_large/" data-orig-file="/2012/01/SV_steroids_large.jpg" data-orig-size="250,332" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SV_steroids_large" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/01/SV_steroids_large.jpg" data-large-file="/2012/01/SV_steroids_large.jpg" src="/2012/01/SV_steroids_large.jpg" alt="" title="SV_steroids_large" width="250" height="332" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6122" /></a></p>

<p>I realize that some of you may be bothered by the steroids topic or a picture of needles, but it’s a topic that comes up a lot (even with people who don’t have any intentions of using). This book purposely reads as a conversation from the author to the reader about the very basics of steroids. The author, Brent Larson, is close with SV’s Johnny Pain and is also friends with steroid guru Anthony Roberts. First, I want to dispel any negative assumptions about this book. It’s not a meat head pro-steroid book. It does not include any information on how to illegally obtain steroids. It merely provides good basic information on what types of steroids a beginner needs to worry about and how to safely take and administer them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to remind the reader that this book is not intended to serve as an endorsement for steroid use, nor is it intended to deter the reader from experiencing the benefits of the drug. It is important to recognize the potential legal and health issues that may arise should you make an informed decision, as an adult, to partake in the use of anabolic steroids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, I found this book to be very informative. It doesn’t cloud the text with tons of chemistry and medical terms, but instead points out the positives and negatives about various types of steroids. It fairly discusses the implications for taking steroids, the side effects, how to train while using, how to administer the various drugs, and the limits of what should be taken within the first few cycles. It also discusses some strategies for how to take them beyond the beginning stages as well as various “stacks” (that term originated in steroid culture, if you didn’t know). <strong>All in all, this book has much more content than the last couple SV books.</strong></p>
<p>There’s even an appendix that includes various stories from first time steroid users — both good and bad — to help the reader make informed decisions. Despite not having any intentions in taking the drugs, even after reading this book, I found it to be very informative and useful; it clears up a lot of misconceptions that non-using steroid haters have.</p>
<p>Some concepts that I found particularly interesting were the concepts that steroids are not magic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steroids will enable to you to train harder and recover faster; use the drugs as a performance enhancement instead of a substitute for hard work, and you will never be disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another concept is that steroids should account for a lack of attention to important aspects of training like diet. For example, I know people who have asked me if they should take steroids and they eat like shit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no drug on the planet that will go to the gym for you or serve as a</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>substitute for the quality nutrition that you need to feed your body.</p>
<p>:::</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are serious enough about your performance to take steroids, there is no reason why you should not have gotten your diet in order long ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I believe that if someone is going to have an opinion on steroids, whether for or against them, they should have a good understanding of what they are and what they do. The ethical and moral discussion are, in fact, relevant, yet steroids can be taken in a way that is not dangerous. Whether or not you support steroids, I think this e-book is very informative and will help uneducated (with respect to steroids) like me understand them better. If you have been mildly interested in using them, then this book will help you make the decision to do so or not (for me, it showed how much of a pain in the ass it is to use them). If you have made the decision to actually use them, then this book will give you good information to prevent you from fucking up your first cycle (whether through poor administration or training).</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> I’m not endorsing the use of steroids, but I think a knowledge of them is useful and important in today’s training society. My primary points is IF you intend to use them, then you should learn and understand everything you can. This <em>Beginner’s Guide to Steroids</em> is a place to start.</p>

  <p>Despite the increase in popularity in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, there are still aspects of it that always work “behind the scenes”. The average fan doesn’t really understand why the U.S. may or may not have a spot in the 2012 Olympics in London. Instead of grumbling and talking about how much American weightlifting sucks, let’s review the process that will determine what male weightlifter will represent the U.S. in London.</p>
<p><em>Note: If I’ve misconstrued or left out anything, just let me know and I’ll amend it.</em></p>
<p>I had a quick phone call with Glenn Pendlay the other day so that he could explain this to me. Basically we need to first earn a spot, and then whichever lifter has the best total (relative to the world average in their weight class) will be chosen. The timing of how this will occur is what makes it weird.</p>
<p>First the men need to earn a spot to go to the Olympics, and that is done at the Pan American Championships a couple weeks after Nationals. Chances are very good, almost certain, that the men will earn a spot. Pendlay even said, “God would need to strike down four or five of the best lifters in order not to earn it.” He even said that if everyone had a bad day then the spot would still be earned. However, earning a spot is still dependent on performing reasonably well at the Pan Am Championships to lock a spot up.</p>

    Olympic hopeful Donny Shankle rests with Jon North between attempts

</div>
<p>Continue Reading –</p>
<p>Average weightlifting fan says, “Wait a sec, didn’t they just do the Pan Ams a few months ago?” The event from a few months ago was the Pan American <strong>Games</strong>, which occurs the year before the Olympic year. Every non Pan Am Games year is just a Pan Am Championship, and that’s what’s happening in late March.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that we have that spot. Each lifter vying for that spot is compared to a standard in their weight class. The top three finishes in each weight class for the last few years are averaged together to make the standard. The American Olympic hopeful is then compared to that average via a percentage. Pendlay told me that based on recent totals, Kendrick Farris has about 90% and Donny Shankle has about 89%. There are, of course, other lifters like Chad Vaughn (two-time Olympian), Matt Bruce, and Zach Krych who have a shot, yet the hurdle for them is to significantly improve compared to what they’ve done in the past.</p>
<p>All of those men have two opportunities to post their best total to count towards making the U.S. Olympic team: Nationals at the Arnold (AKA ‘the Olympic trials’) in the beginning of March and the Pan American Championships at the end of March. This means that the men are more or less battling against each other to have a higher percentage of the world average (for their weight class) to earn the spot to go to London. In other words, it’s kind of a big deal. And that’s why Nationals are going to be “very interesting”, according to Glenn.</p>

    Olympian Kendrick Farris will battle for a spot this March
  </p>
</div>
<p>As of now, the front runners are Ferris and Shankle. Unfortunately, Farris hasn’t had a great showing in his last few meets. On the other hand, Donny has been training very well. I don’t know what Farris is currently putting up, but Shankle totaled 380 last Friday. For Shankle to beat Farris’ current total, Shankle would need to total 381 (meaning he’s very close). However, Farris has the same two opportunities Shankle has to improve. Every bit Farris improves, Shankle will have to improve that much as well. Shankle has a real chance to be the lone wolf representing the U.S. men’s team. The whole thing will be really fun to watch, and best of luck to Kendrick, Donny, and the rest of the men battling for a spot.</p>
<p><strong>Women’s Team</strong></p>
<p>The women have already earned two spots to the Olympics. Currently Sarah Robles is sitting on top and will most likely go (I’m glad she came back from that clarking fiasco from the Pan Am games when she went to World’s). However, the spots aren’t exactly locked up. Rivera (sp?) and Holly Mangold could knock someone down. Danica Rue and Amanda Hubbard are also close. There are several lifters that could perform really well to earn their spot. If anyone has any specifics, then let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, keep in mind that Nationals are occurring at the Arnold this year. This will be an excellent time to not only hang out with other 70’s Big readers, but to see a variety of sports — including the weightlifting meet that may decide which guy goes to the Olympics.</strong></p>

  <p><em>This article is written by my Australian friend Peter Upham. Peter owns <a href="http://shirespeedandstrength.com.au/" target="_blank">Shire Speed and Strength</a> but also has coached, played, and S&amp;C coached American style football for many years. He’s a student of sport history and loves talking about the theory behind training. Two of his kids have received scholarships to play at the University of Hawaii, and that’s where our journey begins.</em></p>
<p>**GENERALLY FOOTBALL</p>
<p>by Peter Upham**</p>
<p>Its playoff time for the NFL, College Football has reached its climax, and so as we have just bypassed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis" target="_blank">Perihelion</a> (the furthest point from the Sun of the Earth’s orbit), those players are also the furthest point from football summer camps and the heat of preseason training.</p>
<p>An athlete does not just ‘do’ their sport. The athlete, does what is necessary to enhance their general abilities whilst they continue to master the technical-tactical skills of their game. For football, like most sports, this was not always the case.</p>
<p>In 1976, Terry Albritton would set the world record in the shot put at the University of Hawaii’s Cooke Field in an all-comer’s meet. The same year, Bill Starr published ‘The Strongest Shall Survive.’ Bill was the Strength and Conditioning coach at Hawaii and would hand over the job eventually to Albritton. Previous to that, he had been the Strength and Conditioning coach for the Baltimore Colts.</p>

<p>Hawaii would become a hotbed of strength training activity. It was the training base for the 1977 IPF World Powerlifting Championships before the team headed to Perth, Australia; the SHW division won by 70’s Big co-captain Doug Young. It was the location of the first 700lb bench press in competition by Ted Arcidi in 1985 at the Budweiser World Record Breakers and the second ever 900lb deadlift by Doyle Kenady. Jim ‘The Anvil’ Neidhart, who was a very competitive thrower before turning to the WWF and ‘The Hart Foundation’, spent time there training; a peer of Albritton’s. The place was not the barbell Mecca of Dayton, Ohio or Venice Beach but it has its place.</p>
<p>The book, was and is, a compendium and anthology of barbell training for football preparation. It was published at a time when strength training for football required a concerted push. Coaches were still largely fixed in the ‘barbells = big/bulky/slow athletes’ epoch, and Starr’s book provided a definitive text that outlined the lifting skills and programming with football players in mind. It also advised on diet, and 5 editions later you’ll still hear it referenced in S&amp;C circles for football preparation.</p>
<p>The Strongest Shall Survive promoted ‘The Big Three’; Squat, Bench and Power Clean. Here was a simple prescription, a 5×5 arrangement of Light, Medium and Heavy alternating lifts. It pictorially explained the lifts and described their use and implementation. Its usefulness set it as the gold standard for many years and it’s rightfully known as a classic.</p>

<p>Starr’s book was written for the very large football population, but the exercise prescriptions in it are general training. Did it mean that if you’re doing ‘The Big Three’, that you were preparing for a football season? Of course not, we know what an obviously fatuous observation that would be, but what about the corollary? Do I need to do those lifts to prepare for football?</p>
<p>There are 3 main influences for exercise prescription; Therapy, Commercialism and Performance. In sport, Performance should be the main influence but there’s gold-in-them-thar-hills! And if you can appear to be providing some sort of elite specialization, then there is a large population out there willing to listen to you and be separated from their money to reach their goals. People prefer it if they feel like a unique special snowflake and the S&amp;C coach wants his team to be taking the shortest cut to better physical abilities. So General preparation has, by Commerical interest, become muddled and rail-roaded into a specialized endeavour.</p>
<p>The football player has a grueling calendar. For large parts of the year, both in competition season and in the Spring practice period, technical-tactical training must be given precedence. Additionally, the fatigue of this practice makes progress in the development of general capacities like strength impossible for anyone but the novice/low intermediate athlete. This leaves us with shortened periods to enhance General capacities like strength, speed (in the main movement pattern running), agility, flexibility and so on.</p>
<p>If the football player is only able to use two blocks of time for the development of general capacities then can he afford for it to be complex?</p>
<p>The strongest and most powerful athletes, those who can move more weight further with less support and in less time, have relatively simple exercise prescriptions that only vary by load. Find a Powerlifter or Olympic lifter and they basically do a few things; but do them really, really well. An Olympic Lifter will Front Squat, Back Squat, Clean, Snatch, Jerk and do some pull ups. Exercise variety usually comes in the form of components of those lifts. It is not unusual however to see vastly complex prescriptions being given to football players.</p>
<p>What would happen if you had athletes who only had a couple of short training blocks in a year, who were asked to implement the entire realm of Commercial interest exercise prescription? Flyes and cables and presses and swings and lunges and jumps and twists? and Lions and Tigers and Bears oh my!</p>
<p>Well you’d end up with barbell mechanics <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9fQ6OUcNHg" target="_blank">like this</a> (how are these PR’s quantified with the hands of 6 spotters on the bar?).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKl0kKE35Wo" target="_blank">And this</a> (WTF is a ‘Whip Snatch’? Isn’t that what you wouldn’t want to do?).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgr6pmh9Ds0&#038;feature=related" target="_blank">And this</a> (how about the mental toughness to ‘master’ those few barbell lifts you give lip service to pal?).</p>
<p>And these are by no means the most egregious. I leave it to the fair-mindedness of the reader; does a football player who cannot squat to a legal IPF depth really need to worry about Bulgarian split squats and box squats with bands and chains?</p>
<p>It seems to me that if you can snatch, you don’t have mobility problems. If you can squat 400lb you don’t have weak legs. If you can deadlift 500lb you don’t have a weak posterior chain, you can’t! But browse the uploads of just about any football program and honestly, do you see barbell competence? Those numbers are not exceptional at all but how many football players can actually do it? If we matched the genetic potential of the talent pool with proper coaching we’d have a lot better result than 500lb quarter squats and 105lb power snatches with a clean grip.</p>
<p>Bill Starr’s book shows the complexity is in the movement pattern, NOT in the prescription. I have always found that it’s more a case of leaving things out than including more in a program when it comes to athletes. Starr’s prescription leaves out the deadlift; a known stressor that the football player may leave out so he may get through his important technical-tactical training without that extra fatigue to adapt to. This is an omission worth noting.</p>
<p>Training, for the general strength trainer, the recreational strength trainer and the competitive strength trainer starts with the mastery of what works for all athletes and evolves through the variance of resistance, not with variance of selection.</p>
<p>The Hawaii story brings this article full circle for me. I have been fortunate enough to send 2 players to play football at Hawaii, and I hope in the future there will be more. Its unusual and notable because, coming from Australia, this doesn’t happen very often. In fact, those two are the only two who have ever played locally and then gone straight to play at a FBS school on scholarship; and they’re not punters! We’re slowly taking your game over, and no, the irony of an Australian writing on a US based website about football is not lost on me. The BCS Championship game has an Australian on each roster, and although we’re mostly punters, we’re just starting at the bottom and working our way up to total domination.</p>

  <p>Is it possible for a female to come in 3rd at an Olympic weightlifting national meet with only three months of training? Typically not, but that’s exactly what Lindsay Taylor at <a href="http://californiastrength.com/" target="_blank">California Strength</a> did. The <a href="http://bbtballer.typepad.com/blog/" target="_blank">CrossFit CenCal</a> co-owner has a background in sports and CrossFit that has prepped her for the dedication and aggressiveness to be a great weightlifter.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWT3UYdh9fo" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>When Lindsay and Glenn Pendlay realized she had potential in weightlifting, she committed to a lifestyle that focuses her available time to train at Cal Strength. Her typical week looks like this: Bright and early Tuesday morning she drives about an hour to Glenn’s house and trains two or three times on Tuesday. Then she stays at Glenn’s house (AKA the weightlifter storage center) Tuesday night and trains another two or three sessions on Wednesday. Then she drives home Wednesday night. Thursday afternoon or Friday morning she drives back to Glenn’s, trains twice on Friday, sometimes trains on Saturday, and drives back home. That’s commitment, folks.</p>
<p>And it’s working. <a href="http://youtu.be/yIuyIY6OiA4" target="_blank">In this video</a> you can see Lindsay working with around 50kg on the clean and jerk. The video embedded above is her hitting 103kg for a single. Astute determination yields great progress, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSLs69kCdf8" target="_blank">this 92kg clean and jerk</a> in early December helped her win third place at the American Open.</p>
<p>Glenn told me that on a decent day Lindsay can snatch 86 or 87 and clean and jerk 103kg. But aside from the commitment, the willingness to get better, and natural talent, Lindsay is a damn fine competitor. Most of you know that the Friday training sessions at Cal Strength are fueled by a cash prize for the best lifter. Pendlay will put a total on the board for each lifter, and whoever goes above that total the most wins the cash prize (which is usually at least $100). For example, Jon North’s might be something like 340 and Shankle’s around 365. One day Lindsay had already PR’d her total, but needed more to win the cash prize. Her best clean and jerk at the time was 95kg and she needed 99kg to win. Guess what she did? She put 99kg on the bar — never having done it before — and killed it. You can’t teach that.</p>
<p>In this video Lindsay cleans and jerks 97kg, then LOWERS IT, then jerks it again. If you aren’t a weightlifter then “lowering the bar” may not make sense, but just imagine doing sort of a negative with about 213 lbs. There are a lot of guys who can’t do that. What’s more impressive is how she came back from an unstable first-rep jerk and solidly put the second jerk overhead.</p>

</div>

<p>“She’s not scared to go under the bar, not scared to put weight on the bar. She’s an aggressive competitor.” That’s just one phrase Glenn used to describe his flourishing lifter. Now Lindsay, Glenn, and California Strength have their eyes set on Nationals at the Arnold Sports Festival in March. I asked Glenn what he thinks Lindsay can hit at Nationals and he said, “Probably snatch 90, clean and jerk 110. I’m <em>confident</em> she’ll total over 200 at Nationals.” It seems doable for Lindsay to increase another 5 kilos or so in each lift in a couple months. Yet her recent history has shown that it doesn’t matter what’s on the bar; just load it up to whatever will win and Wonder Woman will do the rest.</p>

  <p><strong>Happy first PR Friday of the 2012 year.</strong> Post your PR’s or training updates to the comments. You should make plans to go to the Arnold sport festival in March cause a few of us will be going. What that really means is we should all train specifically to walk around ironically flexing with everyone. Schwarzenegger will be mirin’.</p>
<p><strong>Operation Support Donny</strong></p>
<p>Before we start this week’s Q&amp;A, I want to ask you to support Donny Shankle. Donny has a real chance at making it to the Olympics and he’s lifting better than ever. Glenn told me he’s cleaning over 220kg, hitting snatch PR’s and looking damn solid. Yet, Donny is training up to 30 hours a week. In order to recover and focus his efforts he’s taking in fewer personal training clients. <strong>Donny has a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&#038;SESSION=d90wUV0RuZy6V7rTN1MVWLHSw6bnsGL7-JpP_RYAJNI2LQv7m5qB6Z3k0D8&#038;dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8db2b24f7b84f1819343fd6c338b1d9d60" target="_blank">PayPal Donate button on his blog</a></strong> to receive donations as he prepares for Nationals to culminate 10 years of putting his body through hell to try and make the Olympics.

<blockquote>
<p>You said that deadlifts don’t count for posterior chain strength. Can you explain that a little more? What’s missing from the posterior chain in the deadlift?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear jcdyer,</p>
<p>One of the few times I actually get frustrated when running this website are when people misconstrue what I actually say. Here is the direct quote from the post:</p>
<p><strong>Please note that a heavy deadlift is not a representation of posterior chain strength.</strong></p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that “deadlifts don’t count” or that they are “missing a part of the posterior chain”. It means exactly what it says: just because a person can deadlift a lot of weight, it doesn’t mean they have a strong posterior chain. This may not apply to deadlifts that are, say, 650 lbs or greater, but too many people think that their posterior chain isn’t a problem because they can deadlift 500 pounds.</p>
<p>It’s possible to pull a deadlift off the floor with a round back. Then when the bar passes the knees, the knees shift forward, the lower back uncurls, and the knees extend. The knees thing happens <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nok9s2IgvOw" target="_blank">in this video</a>, though the back isn’t terrible (a bullshit red light though). When the knees shift forward, they are flexing. When the knee flexes, the hamstring shortens and subsequently slackens. A shortened and slackened hamstring is not tense, and not having tension in the hamstrings doesn’t help hold the pelvis in place and facilitates a curved lumbar. Not to mention that shortened hamstrings can’t shorten, or contract, any more in order to extend the hip (which is the whole point in doing the lift unless it’s done in a meet). To effectively train the lumbar and hamstring muscles, the lumbar muscles must maintain their contraction to keep the lumbar spine in neutral position (or extension) so that the pelvis maintains it’s anterior rotation to keep the hamstrings tight. Here’s a carefully prepared picture:</p>
<p><a href="/2012/01/hamstringtension.png"><img data-attachment-id="6075" data-permalink="/blog/2012/01/qa-13/hamstringtension/" data-orig-file="/2012/01/hamstringtension.png" data-orig-size="453,374" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hamstringtension" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/01/hamstringtension.png" data-large-file="/2012/01/hamstringtension.png" src="/2012/01/hamstringtension.png" alt="" title="hamstringtension" width="453" height="374" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6075" /></a></p>
<p>Some people can deadlift more weight by doing it crappily, yet this isn’t good in the long run as it will a) blunt their potential in the deadlift by not developing the posterior chain effectively, b) put the lumbar in an injurious position, and c) not have as much carry over into athletic movements or other lifts. Now, jcdyer, what are you going to misinterpret in this answer? That deadlifts make you poop? BECAUSE THEY DO.</p>

<p>[spoiler]Something I’ve wondered that this post made me think about, is the whole idea of “hip drive” not just knee extension? I mean, when you watch videos of Rippetoe coaching hip drive like this one…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&#038;v=yha2XAc2qu8#t=57s" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=yha2XAc2qu8#t=57s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=yha2XAc2qu8#t=57s</a></a></p>
<p>…he is saying “drive up with your butt”. To accomplish that, you extend at the knee. It’s like a leg extension where the foot plate is stationary and you are pushing your body back instead. I’ve never heard an explanation of how “hip drive” actually uses the hips, it uses the quads! In the video at about 1:00 you see him coaching hip drive by letting the back angle stay the same while he focuses on driving up the ass. If the back angle isn’t opening or closing, the muscles in the hip are only working isometrically to maintain the same hip angle.</p>
<p>To me it seems like the muscles of the hips as well as the hamstrings have no actual bearing on the vertical up and down movement of the ass that is referred to as “hip drive”. Anyone able to explain to me what I’m getting wrong?[/spoiler]</p>
<p><em>Edit: TL;DR: Adam is having trouble understanding how the hips drive the ass up in a LB squat and cites an old clip of Rip teaching it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>I like that you are thinking, but you’re a little off here. First, the 1:00 minute mark of that video is a portion of the teaching method of the LB squat that helps teach the trainee how to push the ass. In this video, Rip isn’t concerned with the kid dropping his chest because he’s not focused on the back angle in an unloaded demonstrative squat. So disregard that part of the clip because it’s a coaching topic instead of a mechanics topic.</p>
<p>As for the LB squat itself: yes, the quads are clearly a part of the movement. However, if a lifter drives his heels and pushes with his quads, then the result is the same musculature used in the high bar squat to ascend out of the bottom (you may here this described as “leg pressing out of the bottom”). If you want a full understanding of this, then you should read the squat chapter in Starting Strength because it describes the anatomical function pretty clearly. You are probably missing the fact that the hamstrings not only cross the knee joint (and perform hip flexion), yet the also cross the hip joint (and perform hip extension). Hip extension is when the thigh moves back relative to the torso, or the same thing that occurs during the ascent of the squat. Obviously the knee extensors are also extending the knee during the ascent of the squat, but the goal of the LB squat is to put a premium on hip extension, or “hip drive”. The actual result is a balance around the thighs and hips. If the knees stay in the same position during the bottom half of the squat, then it anchors one end of the hamstrings while the other end is extending the hip. Therefore you have hip extension occurring at the same time with knee extension.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the catch phase in the snatch it seems like a number of lifters have (more) noticeable forward lean. Would LB squatting benefit people who catch in said position?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear garrison,</p>
<p>I don’t know that “a number of lifters” constitutes a large enough percentage of the population to demand a different style of squatting (meaning it’s hard to say how much lifters actually incline their torsos severely). More importantly, the snatch is such a low percentage of the absolute squat max that it doesn’t matter much anyway. However, if we consider the actual mechanics, I wouldn’t want a lifter to use a style of squatting that primarily pushes the ass up (low bar) to help improve his snatch recovery when the overhead position is so sensitive to changes in leverage. In other words, habitually driving the ass up would encourage dumping the bar forward (in snatches or cleans). Also, chronic use of vertical squatting (front or high) would help reinforce the movement pattern necessary for receiving the snatch.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of inclined torso snatch recovery is Marcin Dolega. He does it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxxajrTO5w" target="_blank">during the ascent of this unofficial WR</a>, yet note his actual receiving position:</p>
<p><a href="/2012/01/dolega.png"><img data-attachment-id="6074" data-permalink="/blog/2012/01/qa-13/dolega/" data-orig-file="/2012/01/dolega.png" data-orig-size="309,281" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dolega" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2012/01/dolega.png" data-large-file="/2012/01/dolega.png" src="/2012/01/dolega.png" alt="" title="dolega" width="309" height="281" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6074" /></a></p>
<p>This is clearly vertical torso mechanics in the receiving position. If he used the low bar, he would be reinforcing a more acute hip angle and and more obtuse knee angle in training when his actual receiving position demands a more obtuse hip angle with a completely flexed knee angle. If you read the article from the other day, then you’ll know that this not only effects the movement pattern, but how the muscular is trained through a given ROM. It isn’t specific to the recovery, therefore I don’t see a valid argument for it’s inclusion for this purpose (though I’ll remind you I think the LB squat has utility for the second pull in beginning weightlifters). Lastly, since I know it will come up, why not just front squat to emulate the receiving position? Well, we all know the high bar squat can handle more of a load than the front squat through nearly similar mechanics, so by training high bar it can help make the skill and musculature within the snatch or clean recovery ROM/position stronger than just using the front squat by itself. This paragraph also addressed <a href="/blog/2012/01/low-bar-vs-high-bar-squatting/comment-page-1/#comment-21794" target="_blank">Simonsky’s question from the other day</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, I like the LB squat. I coach it all the time and it’s what I prefer to teach a beginner, but I don’t like it for weightlifting (and this is also from personal experience and success in doing the lifts and not just coaching or programming them). This is a good question, and it’s answer provides valid arguments as to why the LB shouldn’t be used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can you talk more about the knees in High Bar squat? I understand the reason that going below parallel in a LB squat creates an even force between quads and hams on the knee therefore it is better than half squats because it is less anterior force</p>
<p>So what does that say about high bar squatting? are HB squats destined to cause knee problems in the long run? What are the mechanisms that make a below parallel, or even ass to grass, front or high bar squat safe on the knees?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear criedthefox,</p>
<p>First, the reason for going right below parallel on a HB squat is to train the musculature through a full ROM. Any movement that neglects the full ROM (barring pathology) is a worthless movement (unless it’s something like rack pulls). Second, HB or front squats aren’t destined to causing knee problems. While they do have a net anterior force, it doesn’t mean that the hamstrings are “off”. There are some really shitty experiments done by the NSCA that shows some hamstring action in squatting (though they never, ever define what constitutes a squat). More importantly, the knees adapt and improve due to the stress of squatting — in this case high or front squatting.</p>
<p>If a “healthy-kneed” person used HB or front squats, maintained their knee’s adaptations to other movements like running and jumping, and also trained their posterior chain, then they probably won’t have long-term problems. However if they abuse training or programming techniques like constantly overreaching systemically, doing way too much work acutely and chronically, not maintaining their mobility, and having non-training injuries, then it will certainly effect their knees long-term.</p>
<p>Squats are not bad for the knees, but making tons of stupid decisions is. I spend a lot of time trying to help you guys take care of your body, so do it. If you do, you’ll be a strong old pain-in-the-ass grandpa who makes fun of his grandaugther’s husband for not wearing flannel and yogging.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[spoiler]Regarding *cleaning presses*, do you recommend putting the bar back down on the floor and cleaning it again between each press rep if one’s doing a set of several presses.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to adjust either the typical clean grip or typical press-from-the-rack grip to do this? Or should they already be the same?</p>
<p>Any reason to always focus on making the press strict? I’ve always avoided any leg drive in order to emphasize the press as much as possible. Am I missing out on some gains since I could move more weight if I added a little leg drive as you do in that second video? My purpose in doing presses is because strong people like you, Rip, Hepburn et al say to do them. I want to be a strong person and have healthy shoulders, plus any side benefits to my bench strength is a bonus.</p>
<p>Is this still advisable if you don’t have bumper plates to drop the bar down on to? The prospect of having a bar bump my thighs 10+ times twice a week isn’t very appealing, but I seem to recall Bill Starr harping about how this is how it was done in the old days when chest hair and strength were in vogue. So I’ll do it if you think it’s a good idea and figure out how to set it down nicely.</p>
<p>Thank you.[/spoiler]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>TL;DR: He’s asking about cleaning the presses, press grip, mentioned leg drive in the press, strict pressing, not having bumper plates, and some other shit.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Maslow,</p>
<p>This is a weird set of questions from you, but you’re my homie so I’ll answer them.</p>
<p>– No, don’t clean the press for each rep. This would be like racking and un-racking the bar for each squat rep.</p>
<p>– If possible, you should adjust to your press grip for the clean itself. If you normally use a wider grip for cleans (because you have long forearms), then see if you can move the grip in to where your press grip is. It shouldn’t be a high percentage of your power clean, so you should be able to pop it into place with your press grip easy enough. You can bump the press grip one finger width out if it’s giving you trouble (I moved mine out about a half finger width, but I have broad shoulders).</p>
<p>– First, I want to clarify that a “press with leg drive” is a push-press, so the second video I posted was me doing a push-press, not a press. Feel free to do either, but I think there is utility in both. Some people do presses for volume and push-presses for intensity. Glenn Pendlay thinks that push-presses are better than presses all around, but I still like regular presses because they also train that bottom range of motion (and subsequently train the deltoids and triceps through their full range of motion which results in maximum jackage along with the strength).</p>
<p>– You should be able to bring the bar down to your shoulders. I’ll make a video of this once my fucking vertebrae/rib is regular. In the mean time, when you bring it down, don’t worry about controlling it and get your elbows up so it lands on your deltoids (watch Olympic lifters). I know many girls who can do this, so I trust you’ll be able to figure it out after a session or two. If you’re having trouble, talk to Brent as he’s done this with like 275 lbs at a body weight of 160.</p>

<p>What is your opinion of good mornings as opposed to RDLs for strengthening the hamstrings while HB squatting? I just started a 3 month 5/3/1 cycle utilizing HB instead of LB squats after spending a year HB squatting. I did GMs today after squatting and the stretch in my hamstrings feels about the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear philw,</p>
<p>RDLs and good mornings are supposed to have the the same mechanics, yet the loading is different. In practice this isn’t really the case. Both movements are usually done with too much knee and/or lumbar flexion which results in slack, non-working hamstrings. I prefer people to use RDLs as they will be easier and can be loaded with more weight. For example, Pisarenko only used 100k for good mornings, and that’s where I start with my RDLs. If one of the strongest men in history didn’t go beyond 225 lbs for his good mornings, then nobody here has any business doing so. I think RDLs should be used weekly (at the opposite end of the week from deadlifts) with a controlled weight for at least several months, and more like half a year (this would cap the weight in the 225 to 245 range for most people). After they have been employed consistently, then they can be used with heavier weights like <a href="/blog/2011/12/nicu-vlad/" target="_blank">Vlad</a> did. It’s not that I dislike GMs, it’s that I like RDLs so much better.</p>

<p>A quick question regarding the missing type of Squat the Overhead Squat, do you see it as a lowbar or highbar in terms of quads/glutes/hams utilisation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear guythepikey,</p>
<p>I don’t see the overhead squat as something that will build strength and primarily see utility in it to help with the overhead rack position (side note: I never did or do them). To answer your question, it’s going to reflect high bar mechanics. Observe the question above with the Dolega example and you’ll see that the receiving position is in done with HB/front mechanics. Pushing the butt up on the overhead squat will only encourage forward inclination of the torso with a subsequent dumping of the bar forward. Any purposeful attempt to use low bar mechanics on the overhead squat is probably due to a lack of mobility (ankles, knees, hip flexors, external hip rotators, lumbar, thoracic, shoulders, etc.).</p>

  <p>We’ll continue this three-day discussion on squatting by looking at squatting in the sport of powerlifting. In case you missed them, check out the <a href="/blog/2012/01/low-bar-vs-high-bar-squatting/" target="_blank">High/Low Bar Comparison</a> and <a href="/blog/2012/01/squatting-and-weightlifting/" target="_blank">Squatting in Weightlifting</a> posts. I’ll preface this post by saying I only work with raw, non-drugged lifters. I’ve taken a variety of lifters to many meets, including two raw national meets with the USAPL. If I make a mistake in the geared squatting discussion, feel free to correct me if you’re involved in the sport.</p>
<p>When people think about squatting powerlifting, they’ll probably think of a <a href="/blog/2012/01/squatting-and-weightlifting/" target="_blank">multi-ply geared squat that isn’t taken very deep</a>. While I’m not a fan of gear, there are many great people in the geared powerlifting world (e.g. Mark Bell and Donnie Thompson). It’s just a different way to train and express strength, yet the standards make it hard to compare one squat with another squat. Apparently SPF judges their squats by the bottom of the hamstring getting to parallel. This is very different than what USAPL/IPF requires with “the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of the knees”. At this point the geared squatting is almost like a different sport because the standardization of what constitutes a squat is different.</p>
<p>Geared squatting typically utilizes mechanics that utilize the maximum potential of the gear; the lifter would be stupid not too. It’s like a NASCAR team not improving their engine to the potential they can; it would result in losing. Squat suits resist hip flexion and therefore help hip extension. When the hip flexes in the descent of the squat, there is compression about the hip that applies a force to aid in the extension of the hip. Therefore the lifter should squat in a way that applies the most hip flexion. The lifter also wears knee wraps to help extend the knees, yet there will be more aid from the suit itself so the “acute hip flexion” squat mechanics are used. This is why we don’t see geared high bar squats; high bar squatting has a more obtuse hip angle and doesn’t use the suit to it’s full capability. The high bar squat would have more knee flexion, yet the suit is under utilized with these mechanics.</p>
<p>The result is a squatting style with a very wide stance (which may have developed to account for larger lifter’s bellies), vertical shins, and an inclination of the torso that creates acute hip flexion. This is what we see in all of the 900+ squats with multi-ply gear. I know many of you are gear haters, but understand that multi-play gear is completely different than single ply gear. “Single-ply” describes the thickness of the material of the “gear”, or squat/bench/deadlift suit. Standard USAPL fits under IPF ruling, and the IPF uses single ply gear.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Personally, my preference is still with raw lifting, but USAPL/IPF competitors squat with a modified “low bar squat”. The stance is a bit wider, the grip is different (thumbs are wrapped, usually closer grip), and the eye position is different (never down, but forward). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwuSTqA1FlU" target="_blank">Here is a legitimate squat</a> that counted for a WR in the 82.5 class in 2010.</p>
<p>Below is my buddy Brooks Conway, an 82.5 USAPL lifter, squatting a raw 407×5 ezpz. This video represents the same squatting style that he uses with gear (suit and knee wraps). I point it out because it’s just what we refer to as “the low bar” with different eye position and grip. He lifts at <a href="http://www.quest-athletics.com/" target="_blank">Quest Athletics</a> and is coached by Sherman Ledford. Sherman has coached/handled many IPF World Champions and World Record holders and this is how he teaches his lifters to squat. Note the shoes Brooks is wearing — Sherman also has his lifters wear what is essentially weightlifting shoes for squatting (not deadlifting).</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PnhEx2Gl4m4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>As a side note, I see utility in the grip that Sherman teaches and that Brooks uses. The “low bar” has a wider grip with the elbows up to create a shelf with the rear deltoids (Sherman expressed his dislike for this as it encourages the bar to be dumped over the lifter’s head, but I’ve never seen this with decently coached lifters, and my friends have squatted up to the low to mid 600s raw). Instead, I see more utility in the fact that the elbows are pointed down, and then the lats are contracted (look at Brooks in the vid, he ‘tightens down’ before each rep). Consciously contracted lats would make for a stronger and tighter torso. The only issue would be that the wrists are in a compromised position, so wrist wraps would probably need to be worn (I think Brooks is wearing them in this video, I’ll get him to confirm). In any case, the point is that good single-ply lifters lift the same in their gear as they would raw. They will always be strong out of their gear too. Whereas some multi-play, wide-stance squatters are unable to squat impressive numbers to deep depths (since they train to squat high), the single-ply guys are impressive raw.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the next point; raw squatting is best done with the “low bar” mechanics. This is what Alexey Sorokin uses in the 380k WR squat above, and it’s the same thing that Brooks uses in the video above. It’s the same thing that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrGIh84HBzg&#038;list=UUs9S1Uqx7vYYzzQFkf5qcAg&#038;index=5&#038;feature=plcp" target="_blank">Mike Tuchscherer</a> does (albeit with a slightly wider stance). It’s the same thing that Chris has used to squat 644 in competition and what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXeT2KckW7c&#038;feature=plcp&#038;context=C3e867caUDOEgsToPDskLh5hFn3mhnSkGb2zeKK8Nl" target="_blank">Mike used to squat 573</a> (he’s missed more on a questionable depth ruling). It is superior than a wide stance, shin vertical style of squatting because it balances the application of force across the anterior and posterior aspects of the hips and thighs. Wide stance squatting doesn’t put the external rotators into contraction and it provides a different stretch on the adductors than they get when the stance is not wide with the knees shoved out. The knee position is also different as a result of the non-wide stance, so the quads play a greater role in the low bar compared to a wide stance, shin vertical suited squat. This is also why it’s funny to a lot of people (including me) that a portion of the CrossFit community learns the wide stance squatting from Louie Simmons (keep in mind that the majority of the CF community employs efficient high and low bar technique too). “Low bar” squatting mechanics is the most efficient for raw or single-ply squatting. The only difference are the cues employed to have an end product of “low bar” mechanics.</p>
<p>But what about high bar squatting? Some guys are very successful with high bar mechanics in raw powerlifting. The coolest video is Andy Ruse squatting 462×20 below. Andy <a href="http://youtu.be/i7T-s73UUBs?t=2m8s" target="_blank">would later squat 672</a> after a Smolov cycle (don’t know what he could deadlift at that strength). He squatted 639 and deadlifted 683 in a meet in late 2009 (he missed a 661 squat that meet). Unfortunately he has since had to have another surgery to clear bone spurs in his elbow and <a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=118490371&#038;page=53" target="_blank">is no longer going to be powerlifting</a>.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbFGdpQD_O0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The first problem I see with high bar squatting in powerlifting is that the high bar creates an anterior dominated lifter, and this could hurt his deadlift potential. After watching Andy deadlift and do some assistance stuff, I wouldn’t say he’s weak in his posterior chain, but his quads are just so damn impressive that the net result is being anterior dominant. Had he made the 661 squat in that linked video above, his deadlift would only have been 22 pounds above his squat, which is interesting for a raw lifter. While guys can get very, very strong with the high bar, it may blunt their deadlift potential because of the reduced posterior chain involvement in the high bar squat. If that work is present via low-bar mechanics, then it can augment the deadlift training.</p>
<p>Lastly, body dimensions can dictate how successful a lifter can be in a given squat style. A lifter with a long torso and short thighs will have greater success with vertical torso squatting than a lifter with a short torso and long femurs. Long femurs will push the hips back further and the short torso means the lifter has to lean over more. Contrast that with short femurs and a long torso, and this lifter doesn’t have to lean over as much in any squat form. This means that long femured lifters won’t have as much success with front squatting or high bar squatting compared to their short femured counterparts. This may also be why a long femured lifter can benefit from doing some vertical torso squatting; his quads are less effective because of the longer muscle belly and the inefficient position (from having to lean over more). By using the high or front squat, he can improve his quad size and strength to assist in the existing low bar mechanics he uses in competition. This is exactly what Mike has been doing over the last few months, and it’s solidifying his squat (he aims to hit at least 600 at the Arnold in the 275 class).</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the discussion and analysis on squatting over the last few days. Squatting is a fantastic exercise that can be done in different ways to prepare for different things. All in all, just make sure you’re getting under the bar and squatting twice a week (overhead squats don’t count; not enough of a load).</p>

  <p>Most of everyone enjoyed yesterday’s post, so we’ll continue the squatting discussion. Today will focus on how squatting mechanics relate to weightlifting and tomorrow will discuss powerlifting.</p>
<p>I’ll preface this post with the clarification that I’m neither a high level Olympic weightlifter nor a high level Olympic weightlifting coach. I’ve competed at nationals, taken people to meets, and enjoy thinking about programming, mechanics, and how they relate to the function of muscular anatomy. I originally learned the lifts from Rippetoe and have slightly modified some things. I consider Glenn Pendlay a friend and have chatted with him about all kinds of topics in weightlifting. I don’t mention these two guys to get people flipping out about who is right or wrong, but acknowledging that the dichotomy between their coaching is out there on the internet.</p>
<p>First, I want to tell you a story. My first meet was at Spoon Barbell, which is a big barn in North Texas. The inside is dusty and has bars and colored plates scattered around the floor. Furniture lines the center so spectators can sit comfortably during meets. One of the couches is quite possibly the ugliest orange couch in the universe. This is where I first saw two time Olympian <a href="http://weightlifting.teamusa.org/athletes/chad-vaughn" target="_blank">Chad Vaughn</a> lift.</p>
<p>Chad is a shorter guy with a young looking face, a bit of scruff on his chin, and…fucking huge quads. I weighed about 222 at the time and was mirin’ his quad size. In contrast, he didn’t have steel cable hamstrings. It’s not that they were non-existant; it’s just that his quads looked like someone slapped some dwarvish armor on his thighs. I can’t remember exactly, but Chad clean and jerked about 180 (as a 77kg lifter) in that October meet in 2009. I later saw him at the Texas State meet and Senior Nationals in 2010. He’s a really nice guy and I wish I had more time to chat with him.</p>
<p><em>Cool story, bro. What else ya got?</em></p>
<p>There are several points to pull from this story. The first is that Chad has impressive quads. The second is that those quads aren’t just for show, but move a considerable amount of weight. The third is that he’s an Olympian. There aren’t many American Olympians anymore and he’s done it twice. Judging from his muscular distribution, it’s a good bet that he primarily front or high bar squats in training. So here’s a question: If he started low bar squatting, would he improve his best total?</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Let’s ignore his age or limitations (his weakness might be overhead instead of the pull or clean recovery anyway). This isn’t a knock on low bar squatting, but instead observes the current state of adaptation — in this case muscularly — with a given athlete. An athlete’s end product, or current musculature, tells the story about how they train. The end product of the training program will provide support for how the program is conducted. For example, in Greg Everett’s <em>Olympic Weightlifting</em> book, he teaches a very vertical dip-drive for the jerk that primarily uses the knee extensors to drive the weight up. This favors an athlete with a dominant anterior chain. When I originally read that when I got the book, I didn’t like that method and have implemented and coached something different. Part of my reasoning was that if I’m going to create an athlete that has more balance around his hips and knees, then I want to utilize what we created on the dip-drive itself. The result is a dip-drive that has a little bit of hip extension as well.</p>
<p>As you see, the end result of the athlete will dictate the mechanics and training program the coach recommends. The point is it’s not enough to assign a program — or squat style — without acknowledging the athlete. I think that coaches, regardless of level and prestige, all understand that yet the public (forum users, followers, disciples, etc.) do not.</p>
<p>That basically means that it’s possible to train athletes differently and have a successful end result, yet it’s not really possible to take the end result and transform it to how the coach wanted it done from the beginning. In the case of Chad, he’s so advanced from a muscular, strength, and adaptation perspective that approaching things drastically different would not produce similar or better results. It’s the same type of situation if a football team’s personnel is perfectly set up to play a 3-4 defense, and a new coach comes in and tries to change to a 4-3 scheme. The requirements of each position are completely different and this change would not go well if the same personnel were used (to continue the analogy, changing the personnel would also take a long time).</p>
<p>It’s possible to buck the system and deviate from what conventional methods dictate. In this case I’m referring to using a low bar squat for Olympic weightlifting when weightlifting history would favor the high bar squat. Instead of worrying about which squat or program to use, it should depend on the type of trainee and their level of advancement. Anyone who knows me understands that I’m not a zealot of one style of eating or programming because <em>it always depends</em>. This is probably irritating, especially for the people who just want to be given something to follow without having to think about it.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss some opposite view points on how to train a beginning weightlifter.</p>
<p>It really doesn’t matter what type of squat he does; he just needs to squat. Depending on his athletic background, he might easily fit into one squat or another. If a kid has always done high bar squats when looking at the ceiling, he’ll transition very nicely into a high bar squat. Squatting technique has two considerations: the musculature trained and the mechanics used. Properly executed mechanics are a learned skill. It’s the same as a free throw in basketball, a backhand in tennis, and a golf swing. It’s a skill that must be practiced over and over to solidify. However, lifting is different than those other sport examples because the intensity of the movement changes. In basketball, the ball doesn’t increase in weight during the game (although that’d be interesting).</p>
<p>If the young lifter’s goals were to snatch and clean and jerk in competition, would it behoove him to learn a completely different skill (in the form of the low bar squat)? Some people can seamlessly differentiate between the two (I’m one of them), but not everyone can. Whether the athlete can differentiate the two skills, will the low bar squat significantly produce an improvement to warrant it’s inclusion? A standard weightlifting coach would say, “Absolutely not. Why bother with the low bar when we can emulate the same mechanics of the snatch and clean with the high bar? Only using the front squat isn’t enough because more weight can be used with the high bar, therefore more of a progressive overload to get stronger within the confines of the snatch and clean mechanics.”</p>
<p>The low bar proponent would say, “A beginner needs strong hamstrings. Neglecting their posterior chain will only limit them at some point in their training. If the low bar can improve the second pull, then I want that strong in my beginner lifter. Also, I want to get more strong with the low bar and express that strength with the front squat.”</p>
<p>I think the problem with only low bar squatting with front squatting is that the muscular end product wouldn’t be suitable to lift the most weight with vertical torso mechanics. I didn’t front squat 180kx2 because I could low bar squat above 500; I had to build the muscular, strength, and skill of the front squat up in training.</p>
<p>Using the ‘high bar method’ for beginners necessitates assistance work for the hamstrings (like the RDL) during a linear progression and would favor doing the full lifts (i.e. squatting the snatches and cleans most of the time). The ‘low bar method’ could focus on primarily power snatching and power clean and jerking. After a linear progression with the low bar, it could be dropped in favor of the high bar and front squats for a few weeks while still doing the power version of the Olympic lifts, and then convert over to the full Olympic lifts.</p>
<p>The primary goal is to get the athlete stronger and get plenty of reps with the Olympic lifts, yet we’ve talked about two completely different paths of getting there. Either way, my observation and opinion is that the intermediate lifter benefits most from focusing on the movements that most closely mimic the mechanics of the actual Oly lifts. Personally I’d be more open to using the low bar in “off-season” periods when there aren’t any big meets coming up, but primarily in an assistance role.</p>
<p>However, ‘late stage intermediates’ and advanced weightlifters won’t bother with ancillary work and primary funnel their efforts into the lifts themselves with assistance that closely resembles the mechanics. That’s why we see the California Strength guys doing clean and jerk complexes, jerks from blocks, or hang work — it all directly resembles the competition lifts or is a piece of the competition lift.</p>
<p>Overall, the message is the same as yesterday: you need to squat. But in this case, squatting with mechanics that emulate the competitive lifts not only improves the skill of that positioning and ROM, but develops the musculature that would be optimal for applying force through the same position and ROM. That’s why I support using the high bar version overall and only support the low bar for beginners (it definitely helps the second pull).</p>
