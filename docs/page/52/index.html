  <p>If you’ve been involved in various online training communities like CrossFit, Starting Strength, the Pendlay Forum, Strength Villain, Bodybuilding.com, StrongLifts, 70’s Big, or others, you may have seen trainees making the distinction between the low bar and high bar styles of squatting. There’s even been some (in)famous <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank">arguments</a> on these forums (I remember the Rippetoe/Everett one being particularly laborious on the CF forums). This post aims to explain the utility in differences in these squats as well as when to use them.</p>
<p>Before we begin, much like the <a href="/blog/2011/12/whats-the-deal-with-crossfit/" target="_blank">post on CrossFit</a>, I have a unique history on the topic. The primary proponent of the low bar squat is Mark Rippetoe and I worked closely with him for a year and half. I’m one of the few people who used the low bar squat for a long period of time and then transitioned into Olympic weightlifting. I also have a thorough understanding of the low bar squat and how to coach it, and this sets me apart from anyone who scoffs at it. Don’t assume that makes me a disciple of the movement or of Rippetoe. This will be a relevant discussion with logical reasoning behind every point.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Low and High Bar Squat?</strong></p>

<p><em>Front, High Bar, and Low Bar squats</em></p>
<p>I pulled the above image from a CrossFit site, but it comes from <em>Starting Strength</em> by Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore. Lon drew this series of squat styles to show the difference in the front squat, high bar squat, and low bar squat. In any compound barbell lift done with the lifter standing on the ground, mechanical efficiency is achieved by the bar having a vertical relationship with the middle of the foot. If it travels in front or behind this point, then there is a mechanical disadvantage do to the creation of lever arms.</p>
<p>The placement of the bar will change the lifter’s necessary positioning to maintain the bar/mid-foot relationship. The front squat has the bar racked on the deltoids, so in order to keep the bar over the mid-foot, the torso must be very vertical. In the high bar squat, the bar shifts to sit on the traps (but not the seventh cervical vertebrae) and the lifter has a slight inclination forward, yet still remains pretty vertical to keep the bar over the mid-foot. Contrast these two positions with the low bar (on the right of the picture above) in which the bar is moved down to sit on the rear deltoids and across the spine of the scapula. In this position, the lifter must incline his torso more forward in order to keep the bar over the mid-foot. Also note that the verticality (not a word) of the squat style changes the knee position; the more vertical the squat, the more forward the knees. This is important for understanding muscular recruitment.</p>
<p>The high bar is a simple “go down, squat up” kind of movement. In contrast, the low bar squat requires much more attention to detail and is more difficult to do correctly. The low bar focuses on creating a stretch reflex with the hamstrings out of the bottom and a focus on “hip drive” to put an emphasis on using the extensors of the hip on the ascent. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Differences in Muscular Recruitment</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]The positioning of the bar will dictate what mechanics must be used to maintain lifting efficiency. The mechanics will dictate what musculature is used. Succinctly, more vertical squat techniques use the quads and glutes as the primary movers while the low bar puts a premium on the posterior chain (particularly the hamstrings) for hip drive. The low bar squat also has a balanced anterior/posterior force at the knee because the focus on the hamstring contraction pulls back on the knee. In contrast, the high bar has more of an anterior stress since the quads are the primary movers and attach at the front of the knee at the patella. There is some quadriceps involvement in the low bar squat, but not nearly as much as the high bar squat. There is a little hamstring involvement in the high bar (see below), but not nearly as much as the low bar squat.</p>
<p>The forward knee placement in the front and high bar squats result in an acute knee angle. An acute knee angle means that the hamstrings — crossing the knee and hip joints — are contracted and slackened. If the hamstrings are fully contracted, then they cannot contract to help extend the hip out of the hole. This means that in vertical squatting styles, there is no hamstring involvement out of the hole, and limited involvement throughout the ascent. However, note the slight torso difference between the front and high bar squats; the inclination in the high bar style provides more of an angle that allows some hamstring tension. The upper two-thirds of the ascent of a high bar squat can have assistance by the hamstrings to hold the back angle in place (the same way that they do with the low bar or a deadlift). This makes sense as the position can re-apply tension on the hamstrings once the knees are no longer acutely flexed. I have felt this when high bar squatting, but you can see it during these hellacious sets that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO3rv5vHy00&#038;feature=channel_video_title" target="_blank">Max Aita did at California Strength</a>.</p>
<p>To clarify the hamstring involvement during the high bar: the descent occurs, the knees flex acutely at the bottom in the hole, the ascent begins with zero hamstring tension due to knee flexion, as the knee angle opens the hamstrings can receive tension, and there is hamstring tension during the ascent. Note that this tension is not a primary mover due to the torso angle.</p>
<p>In contrast, the low bar squat maintains tension throughout the descent, creates a stretch reflex to “bounce” off the tense hamstrings, and then utilizes the hamstrings to extend the hip. During the ascent, the quads obviously extend the knee, but they help create balance around the knee so that the hip drive doesn’t tip the torso forward (the torso obviously needs to maintain it’s angle out of the hole). Since this style of squatting is dependent on the hamstrings, the body’s positioning — particularly the knees — is much more important. If the knees shift forward at the bottom, then hamstring tension will decrease and will result in no bounce whatsoever. Discussing other faults in the low bar squat leaves the scope of this post. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Pros/Cons of the Low Bar Squat</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]The low bar squat is said to “use more muscles” than the high bar squat. This may not be an accurate statement since all squatting will use the thigh and hip muscles, but it definitely uses the musculature differently. It puts a premium on training the posterior chain; this makes it useful for general strength trainees, athletes, and powerlifters. General strength trainees and athletes need to get the most strong in the time they spend training, so squatting with a hamstring-focused style can help that. Most trainees and athletes have weak posterior chains anyway. For raw powerlifters, they will be able to lift more weight in the long run by efficiently using all of the musculature in their competition squat. Powerlifters in their first few years of training will get the most out of using the low bar squat.</p>
<p>The low bar squat can also help very weak and novice trainees improve the second pull of their Olympic lifts. During my linear progression, I saw a direct correlation with my low bar squat numbers and my power snatch and power clean. I’ve seen this with other lifters and it makes sense; the posterior chain is responsible for the fast extension of the hips in the clean or snatch. The purpose of this post isn’t to discuss Olympic weightlifting programming, but the low bar squat is not productive for teaching and ingraining proper receiving position in the snatch or clean. The low bar squat will train the thigh and hip muscles differently, and the high bar squat most closely resembles the snatch and clean should be used regularly.</p>
<p>General strength trainees or athletes may not need to do the full clean or snatch to improve their ability to display power, so the high bar squat may not be necessary for them. Yet, as always, it depends on the individual. There aren’t too many trainees who have a dominant posterior chain, but if this existed, the high bar squat would help improve this balance. Please note that a heavy deadlift is not a representation of posterior chain strength.</p>
<p>Some other problems with the low bar squat include it’s difficulty. It’s not easy to do properly. This doesn’t mean it should be avoided, but some trainees do such a shitty job of executing it that it’d be better if could wait to receive proper coaching. Also, some trainees don’t have enough flexibility in their shoulders to put the bar in the right position. When they attempt to do so, it may result in shoulder, wrist, or elbow pain. If any problems in those joints become debilitating to training, the trainee should use a different style of squatting until they a) alleviate the painful symptoms and — more importantly — b) address the underlying mobility problem that is causing the pain.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the low bar is that the force around the knee is balanced because the hamstrings are pulling back on the tibia. People with knee pain will want to utilize the low bar squat. If the knee pain is from pathology, this may be their preferred style of squatting. If the trainee is young and healthy but experiences knee pain in squatting, this style of squatting can reduce the stress applied to the front of the knee and act as a transition exercise to other forms of squatting.</p>
<p>Summary: The low bar is good for general strength training and powerlifting, yet it’s difficult to do well. It may have a place — much like the bench press — in beginner Olympic weightlifting training depending on the trainees weaknesses, but probably shouldn’t be used beyond the beginning stages.[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Pros and Cons of the High Bar Squat</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]While the low bar does utilize the posterior chain better than the high bar squat, that doesn’t mean the high bar is worthless. The hamstrings will grow in the low bar, yet the quads may not achieve their muscularity and fullness. The high bar utilizes the quads and can help develop the anterior aspect of the thigh — in other words, it helps create bouldered (also not a word) quads. It’s not limited to aesthetics, because the high bar squat will develop the strength of the quads as well. I’ve seen various types of low bar squatters with deficiencies in their quads. After dropping in front or high bar squats in their program, their low bar technique improves. Mike, for example, uses high bar in his advanced Texas Method template (this is discussed in detail in Part 2 of the Texas Method e-book). If you’ve been using the low bar for at least a year, consider using some high bar to balance out your training.</p>
<p>Chronic high bar use can neglect the hamstrings, and this is why I always make a point to program RDLs with the high bar squat. Keep in mind that the low bar squat’s purpose is to utilize the hamstrings, yet there is a portion of the population who low bars but doesn’t have good hamstring development. Low bar squatting doesn’t guarantee good hamstring strength.</p>
<p>If a trainee has pathology in their knee, then high bar squats may provide too much anterior force and result in knee pain. If the trainee is younger and injury free, and they have pain with high bar squats, they may want to check that they aren’t going “ass to grass” (which isn’t necessary until intermediate stages of Olympic weightlifting training anyway) and allow their knees to adapt to two or three sessions a week before having a higher frequency.</p>
<p>High bar squats are obviously preferable for Olympic weightlifting as the squat mechanically mimics the receiving position in the snatch and clean. Also, if the trainee has been low barring for a long time, they will have developed musculature to support those mechanics. By high barring, they can create a balance in their musculature that allows for better weightlifting. For example, when I got into Olympic weightlifting after low bar squatting for about nine months, I definitely experienced problems with heavy front squats and overhead squat positioning. After front squatting more, my positioning improved. At the time I didn’t high bar, but I do nowadays and feel it’s utility when doing the Olympic lifts.</p>
<p>If the low bar squat is difficult or injurious to the shoulders, then just high bar squat. The low bar may have more utility for general populations, yet if it’s debilitating other squat forms should be used. Besides, the hamstrings can still be trained with some properly executed assistance exercises, though it won’t be as effective as the low bar squat.</p>
<p>Summary: The high bar squat is superior for Olympic weightlifting because it teaches proper clean/snatch receiving positioning. If there are problems with the low bar squat, then the high bar can be used to balance musculature or maintain squatting frequency. However, the high bar doesn’t utilize the hamstring’s stretch reflex nor does it develop the posterior chain. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]It doesn’t fucking matter. Seriously. A few weeks ago a kid asked me what muscles an assistance exercise I was doing worked, and I briefly explained it, but followed it up with, “But you really only need to be squatting. Don’t worry about this other shit.”</p>
<p>If you’re gonna be a powerlifter, then use the low bar. If you’re going to compete in Olympic weightlifting, then use the high bar. If you have deficiencies in one area, then the other squat can improve that deficiency. If you can do both reasonably well and aren’t training for one of the barbell sports, then use both.</p>
<p>In powerlifting the high bar can improve the top half or two-thirds of the ascent of the competition squat but would only be used by experienced lifters. In weightlifting the low bar squat can help improve the second pull but would only be used by inexperienced lifters. General strength trainees should just worry about their weakness. If they are balanced, then they shouldn’t give a shit and use the squat style that will help achieve their goals. And that’s what it’s really about: use the lifts that will help achieve your goals from a muscular development, strength, and mechanics perspective.</p>
<p>To learn how to low bar squat, then check out <em>Starting Strength</em>. To learn how to high bar squat, put a bar on your back and squat all the way down with your knees shoved out. There’s utility in both. If you’re confused, just pick one and do it at least twice a week.</p>

<p>No gym access for two weeks…what should I do to maintain strength?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Spencer,</p>
<p>Strength is a persistent adaptation and you won’t be losing much of it in a two week period. What you’ll most likely lose instead is your adaptation to the strength training. When you start training again you’ll be more sore than normal and your blood vessels won’t be used to the higher pressure of lifting. This is why I have always advocated having a light day when first getting back in the gym. Gradually increase the weight and stress over a few training sessions. If you had a significant layoff, then use the first week as a ramp up. It’s better to do to little than to do too much.</p>
<p>As for training or working out during your break, consider what physical attributes are lacking with respect to either overall fitness, athletic ability, or your specific goal(s). It may be a good time to work on muscular endurance via calisthenics (especially if you’re in the military and have to deal with PT tests). 99% of you need to work on mobility on a daily basis. Others could implement a sprint or conditioning program. Still, if strength and size are your primarily goal, you could do some sort of plyo calisthenics to focus on a speed and power element. For example, clapping pushups, speed pull-ups, and jumping squats could be done for sets of five to ten. Gymnastics type stuff can apply a strength training stress through a different angle or range of motion.</p>
<p>The overall point is that it’s not a long break and you won’t lose significant strength. Take care of your body and feel free to dabble in some un-used training modalities.</p>

<p>‎1. What’s the recommended grip for the barbell row? I’ve been using bench width, but does it matter or is it just personal preference/which muscles you want to focus on?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Can you work on pull ups every day (or even multiple times a day), or is that too much stress to recover and adapt?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Kyle,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the same reasons as the bench press, the optimal grip will be similar to the bench in which the forearms are vertical and the elbows are over the wrists. This should be pretty much the same position on the bar (for me, it’s pinky on the rings). My opinion is that if you’re using the row for strength training purposes, use this efficient grip. If you’re going for a swollertrophy effect, do whatever you want. However, just like in the bench press, the most efficient method will train all of the musculature evenly. After a rowing session, my entire lat will be sore all the way down to my iliac crest. But I’m also sore in the upper middle back area where the middle traps and rhomboids are. It’s a very effective exercise. I don’t really see a point with messing with the grip until the hypertrophy is a primary goal. For example, the close grip bench is used to improve the lockout of a raw bench, but the close-grip row wouldn’t have utility to improve the performance of another lift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether or not pull-ups can be done every day depends on what else is in the training program and what the trainee is adapted to. If you have a break from strength training, then daily pull-up training is probably fine if don’t do too much. If you’re only adapted to about 30 reps, don’t do 50. To be safe, just take a day of rest in between pull-ups sessions. However, if you’re using the frequency method then you’ll be doing a low enough number that can be done daily (yet you’ll obviously take a day or so of rest at some point in the week).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Also, in the book you mention a back off set on ID when using 3 reps or less, with your example being 15lbs lower than the PR attempt. Does doing this back off set change VD or not?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Justin,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don’t focus on the number of sets, but the overall volume. In the first year or so in the TM, we use a relative drop in volume as a stressor (this is explained in detail the second book). Your volume will be relative to what you’ve been doing recently, so it’s hard to answer this questions. You do not need to do eight triples on VDy just because you’re doing a triple on the ID. In fact, if you remember from the book, trainees should aim to get to 3×5 on the VD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The back off set does not change the VD. The 15 pound drop is a minimum, so feel free to have a greater decrease. The point is to get some more reps with decent intensity.</p>

<p>I’m only just learning the Oly lifts. I want to get back to lifting heavy, but continue doing the Oly stuff at least twice a week. Any programming advice? FWIW, my best strength results have come from 5/3/1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Jason,</p>
<p>Now that I’m reading this again, I have no clue what you’re asking. You want to strength train but have been doing Oly stuff? You want to do an Oly program? It’s more important for me to point out that your clarification that 5/3/1 has given you the best results is irrelevant — unless you’re older. It works well with older guys because it doesn’t have a lot of volume so it prevents the hard-headed overtraining associated with the male gender. However, we don’t know anything else about you, specifically your training history and current state of adaptation. The fact that 5/3/1 “worked” for you may be because you were on shitty programs before doing it. Who knows, maybe you were doing CrossFit before it. In any case, saying that 5/3/1 gave you best results may or may not be relevant when committing to a programming style.</p>

<p>Using 4×5 as a volume scheme on texas method. yes, no terrible idea?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Marquis,</p>
<p>It depends. The current state of adaptation and the prior training history will dictate this. 4×5 may be useful in a portion of the program when the lifter is gradually reducing the volume over time, and it may be a bad idea when the lifter is adapted to lower amounts of volume. Folks, remember that context isn’t just relevant, but entirely necessary when trying to talk about programming.</p>

<p>Should someone who is only focused on olympic lifts bench press? My experience before focusing on olympic lifts was that I benched once or twice a week depending on programing and I had some bench strength but no mobility for overhead. Now after not benching for nearly 6 months, 135 feels heavy, but I am a lot stronger overhead than I have ever been and much more mobile. Able to snatch over bodyweight etc. Thoughts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Jose,</p>
<p>My first response is that 135 should never, ever feel heavy for someone who lifts regularly. Assuming you didn’t mean kilos, it’s okay, but I think that this weak bench is something to address. My next statement is objective and not mockery: If 135 pounds on the bench press is heavy, then you aren’t lifting enough in the Oly lifts to warrant a specific weightlifting focus that ignores the bench. Another way of saying is that you are pretty weak, so the bench press is something that will help you not be weak.</p>
<p>Anatomically, the bench press trains structures that will help improve your strength and stabilization in overhead movements. Consider a snatch in which the bar travels to far back. By having decent anterior shoulder and pec strength, you’ll be able to wrangle it back forward to it’s proper positioning. More strength around the shoulder means more stability when going overhead, even if the mechanics aren’t perfect.</p>
<p>My last point is that most famous weightlifting programmers from countries with better historic results in the Olympics and world competitions will have beginning lifters bench press. The frequency might range from once every seven to ten days. Eventually, an intermediate weightlifter will drop the bench in favor more weightlifting specific training, yet the bench can be useful early on in order to establish musculature and strength to support shoulder strength and stability.</p>
<p><strong>Here is another point from Brent:</strong></p>
<p>jose it depends on if you’re ok with some high school fuck head in junior varsity football benching more than you. that’s mainly why i bench. mobility shouldn’t be an issue if you have a resistance band and a lacrosse ball. it’s not necessary for oly but it absolutely doesn’t hurt and may even help if your shoulders need to be stronger. imo touching bottom with good external rotation and driving through the middle of a pr bench feels just as good as smoking the pull in a pr snatch and receiving it exactly where it needs to be</p>
<p>I still have some questions from the Facebook thread, but I’ll save them for another time. I used to care about answering all the questions, but then I took an arrow to the knee.</p>
<p>See you guys next year. And please…be safe.</p>

  <p>About a year ago I started cleaning all of my press sets, and I prefer it. There’s a lot of utility in doing it, but it’s just cool. Here’s an example:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MS3Itmh34Fo" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Weightlifters in the press era (before ’72) always cleaned their presses because it was a contested lift. In the early days, there weren’t even racks, so cleaning the weight was the only way to get it on the shoulders for overhead movements. Whenever Bill Starr writes about pressing, he encourages lifters to clean it and even said that it’s possible to lift more weight that way. Bah, how could that make any sense?</p>
<p><strong>Lift More Weight</strong></p>
<p>Yet, the first time I cleaned and then pressed the weight, I completed a weight that was typically difficult out of the rack easier. I believe this was because my grip widened slightly (I have broad shoulders) and perhaps I was using a more narrow grip. However, other lifters have echoed similar experiences in lifting more after cleaning the weight. Some possible explanations include better wrist position after doing a clean compared to a normal un-racking, better intra-thoracic/abdominal pressure post-clean, or better thoracic extension post-clean. It also could be a combination of all three reasons, plus some other factors that are specific to an individual.</p>
<p><strong>Practice The Clean</strong></p>
<p>Since you’ll be cleaning every set of press or push-press, you’ll significantly enhance the number of cleans you perform IRREGARDLESS of program. This may not be relevant for a stress application — for example, my best press of 240 is at most 68% of my max clean — yet it can solidify starting position and teach attention to detail regarding “finishing the pull”. It can be used as speed practice; really focus on a fast jump in the power clean. It can also be practice for “getting under the bar” in a full clean. Since it’s probably a lower percentage of your max, it won’t significantly inhibit the press itself or the rest of the training session. Whether you want to power it for general strength work or do a full clean for Oly practice, you’ll get more repetitions which will only improve your skill. Uh, assuming you don’t suck really bad or something.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><strong>Get Effective Clean Work In</strong></p>
<p>If the power clean or clean is a higher percentage of your max, then you train two movements at the same time. For example, in this 300 pound push-press, I power clean the weight:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/doz6O1MKMcQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>That might be at most 92% of my max power clean (I don’t drop closer to parallel for power cleans). Yet it’s a high enough percentage where I’m receiving some stress from the power clean itself in addition to the stress applied from doing the push-presses. Assuming your technique is decent, you can kill two birds with one stone by training the power clean or clean as well as the overhead movement. This can help the lifters who need to be efficient with their time usage.</p>
<p><strong>It’s Cool</strong></p>
<p>Taking a weight off the floor, putting it on your shoulders, and then putting it overhead has been done as a test of strength for thousands of years. The bench press became more popular in the last fifty years because it’s used in football training and testing, but lying on your back is a poor excuse for strength compared to muscling something overhead. Being the only guy in an average gym that can put two or three hundred pounds over his head easily makes you instantly more badass than Johnny Flex mirin’ his bis, tris, kis, dis, and tis in the corner. If I see someone put a decent weight overhead out of the rack, I’ll think, “Well, he didn’t clean it.” To me, it’s like not walking a squat out; cleaning the weight is old school and badass.</p>
<p><strong>It’s Functional</strong></p>
<p>The CrossFit crowd often needs to validate what they do by a movement’s utility. I can’t think of anything more relevant than picking something up and moving it around. Besides, the clean and press falls into the “<a href="/blog/2010/12/how-to-press-your-girlfriend/" target="_blank">pressing your girlfriend</a>” realm. If you can’t do that, then you’re not functional.</p>
<p><strong>It Will Help You Not Be Fat</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a fat person who doesn’t want to be a fat person, then doing more “full body” lifts will help. Training a lot of musculature has a greater systemic effect. In order to recover and adapt from systemic stresses, more calories are needed. Also, the hormonal response is different in that it promotes muscular growth and fat loss (when combined with an appropriate diet). Even if you’re still squatting in the workout, by doing some power cleans with your press, you’ll train more muscles to have a larger systemic stress to help you lose fat compared to the same workout without the clean.</p>
<p><strong>You’ll Get Stronger and Bigger</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, by doing the clean with your press or push-press, you’ll get stronger. You’ll be regularly training more musculature that includes the quads, hamstrings, glutes, lower back, upper back, and traps. You’ll solidify your pulling technique as well as add ancillary work. You’ll get adapted to a greater work load by doing more full body lifts in the week. It will make you a better person. It will make you rich. Everyone will love you. It’ll rain tits on you. You’ll walk on the moon without a space suit and be okay.</p>
<p>Start cleaning your presses and push-presses. It’ll make you a better human.</p>

  <p>The other day in the <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-awareness/" target="_blank">Foot Awareness</a> we talked about being aware what our feet are doing. Faults such as walking “duck footed” or having a collapsed arch (AKA “navicular drop”) is is important for running economy, but also lifting technique. Either way it’s important because if the mechanics aren’t efficient, then more energy is consumed to accomplish the same task. Solid mechanics will utilize less energy, therefore you can run faster or lift more weight with the same energy and effort.</p>
<p>If you have either of the above problems, then the first thing to do is learn awareness of what is wrong and what is right. If your toes are habitually rotated out, then make it a point to walk and stand with them forward. If your toes have been habitually pointed out, then it’s likely that the arch is habitually collapsed. While standing with your toes pointed forward, shift your weight from your normal collapsed position (which is the inside of the foot) to the outside of the foot. Take note of where your knee shifts to when you do this (it will externally rotate slightly). Use <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/12/episode-349365-what-if-we-just-used-a-joint-stabilityfunction-approach.html" target="_blank">this video</a> as a guide if you’re confused. This new position is your habitual goal. To help learn it, do a set of at least 20 contractions shifting your weight from the inside to the outside of the foot. This will use tire some of the muscles in the foot and shank to help learn positional awareness.</p>
<p>Now that you are aware of this new position, you need to walk on it. Make it a point to walk with the toes forward and on the outside of your foot. It will feel very funny and you’ll find that you often forget to do it. For example, my right foot (the problematic one) will revert back to its collapsed position when I take a piss. After several weeks of paying attention to keeping the force application on the outside of my foot, I’ve shifted my focus to the distal end of the metatarsals of the “middle” and “ring” toes — it’s the lateral portion of the ball of the foot. This maintains the proper arch and knee position, but it’s overly emphasizing the lateral portion of the foot.</p>
<p>The first set of drills I want to bring to your attention are <a href="http://files.meetup.com/445445/footDrills.pdf" target="_blank">Russ Ebbets foot drills</a>. These simple, non-equipment drills take about four minutes to complete. In the article, Russ has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Done daily these six drills will eliminate shin splints, Achilles’ tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, lessen the chance of a severe ankle sprain and virtually all knee problems. The famous Rice Study done in the early 90s found that 79% of running injuries are from the knee down. One of the reasons I had successful teams is that my athletes made it to the competition day healthy and ready to compete. Season after season was completed with virtually no injuries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intriguing. I’ve started doing these drills every day and can definitely understand their utility. Whether you want or need to run, sprint, ruck, or move on your feet, they can help. You’ll feel various parts of your lower leg working that typically don’t get any specific work, and some of the drills will even have an effect all the way up through the hips. The six drills are based on three variations of movement: lateral change in the ankle (inversion/eversion), rotation of the hip (external/internal rotation), and frontal action of the hip (plantar/dorsi flexion).</p>
<p><a href="/2011/12/foot-drills-1.png"><img data-attachment-id="6022" data-permalink="/blog/2011/12/foot-drills/foot-drills-1/" data-orig-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-1.png" data-orig-size="397,109" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="foot drills-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-1.png" data-large-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-1.png" src="/2011/12/foot-drills-1.png" alt="" title="foot drills-1" width="397" height="109" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6022" /></a></p>
<p>The first drill focuses on inversion and eversion. Be sure to walk with a controlled “heel to toe” when doing all of these drills as it will have more of an effect on the muscles of the foot compared to stepping down with a flat foot. The eversion drill will probably show you how bad your eversion mobility is; a lack of eversion will make it difficult to shove the knees out. If you’ve ever noticed that shoving your knees out lifts the inside of your foot off the ground, then you probably need to improve your lateral ankle mobility.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/12/foot-drills-2.png"><img data-attachment-id="6023" data-permalink="/blog/2011/12/foot-drills/foot-drills-2/" data-orig-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-2.png" data-orig-size="393,106" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="foot drills-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-2.png" data-large-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-2.png" src="/2011/12/foot-drills-2.png" alt="" title="foot drills-2" width="393" height="106" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6023" /></a></p>
<p>These two drills will force stretching and contraction in the hip. You’ll feel like an idiot doing it, but you’ll also feel work throughout your hips. Remember to maintain the “heel to toe” walk.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/12/foot-drills-3.png"><img data-attachment-id="6024" data-permalink="/blog/2011/12/foot-drills/foot-drills-3/" data-orig-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-3.png" data-orig-size="397,104" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="foot drills-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-3.png" data-large-file="/2011/12/foot-drills-3.png" src="/2011/12/foot-drills-3.png" alt="" title="foot drills-3" width="397" height="104" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6024" /></a></p>
<p>I didn’t feel much when I did the “walking backwards on the toes” drill, although it helped warm-up my calf and achilles. However the dorsi-flexion “walking on the heels” will force contraction in the tibialis anterior, or the front of the shin.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these drills aren’t a quick fix to any foot or ankle issues. They should be utilized daily to gradually improve the lower leg structures, but they can be used as a warm-up for running or sprinting. They will help improve the awareness of the foot’s articulation with the ground which will only improve mechanical efficiency in locomotion.</p>
<p>All of the attention spent on changing walking gait and doing these easy exercises may produce some soreness in the arch or lower leg. In future posts we’ll get into more drills, exercises, and mobility, but in the mean time just work a lacrosse ball over your arch to alleviate some tension.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are some cues I should keep in mind for teaching my wife (or anyone) to high bar squat? I’ve looked on YouTube but I never know who is full of shit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Kyle,</p>
<p>I briefly answered this in the wall thread, but figured it would be good for others to hear too. Irre-fucking-gardless of type of squat, the knees need to be shoved out. This will prevent hip impingement — a pinching of the femur and the ASIS (hip bone) that can prevent full ROM, prevent the lumbar from maintaining extension, and can pinch tissues like skin, fat, tendons, or muscles. There’s no point in explaining it further when a <a href="http://startingstrength.com/articles/active_hip_2_rippetoe.pdf" target="_blank">comprehensive article</a> has already been written. So “knees out” is an important cue for any squatting, including the high bar squat.</p>
<p>The chest also needs to be up so that the thoracic spine is held in extension from the time the bar is un-racked until it is re-racked. I’ve been meaning to do a post on this for a while, because I see a lot of you fucking it up. Think “chest into chin”, which is the cue that means, “pull your chest up as high as you can, as if you were going to try and touch your chin without actually lowering the chin”.</p>
<p>The eyes need to be forward. Some look up, but this puts the cervical spine in extension and I’m not a fan of that. Eyes straight ahead will help maintain proper positioning throughout the entire spine.</p>
<p>Those last two things (the chest and eyes) are passive cues — the lifter shouldn’t have to think about them at all because they should be automatic every time. Assuming “knees out”, “chest to chin”, and the eye positioning is all correct (or at least the passive cues are automatic), then “heels” can be cued. That’s the cue to imply “drive the heels out of the bottom” in order to prevent any forward torso inclination during the ascent as a result of shifting the weight to the balls of the feet.</p>
<p>And for fuck’s sake, if you’re trying to high bar squat without weightlifting shoes then that’s the first thing to correct. <a href="/blog/2011/04/gear/" target="_blank">Here’s the gear post</a>.</p>

<p>Quick question…on 70sbig.com what do you put first when describing work sets…sets or reps? Does 5×3 mean 5 sets of 3, or vice versa? I think Rippetoe uses reps x sets in his books, but Gym Jones guys and some of my friends use sets x reps. Opinions? What’s more popular? It’s always been confusing translating people’s whiteboard scribbles on diff. sites/blogs! Thanks in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Victor,</p>
<p>We’ve already had a chat about this on the wall thread, but this is something else that would be interesting for other people who are wondering the same thing. Read 3×5 as “three sets of five” (we say “three by five” verbally). Read 405x5x3 as “405 for three sets of five”, but it literally reads “405 times five reps times three sets”. The 405x5x3 example makes the most sense for inputting data in your training log. It helps to say it out loud. You don’t ever say “five by three” to insinuate “three sets of five”, so we say “three by five” which is literally written as 3×5.</p>

<p>I’ve always pressed with a pretty wide grip. I’d measure with my thumb from the beginning of the knurl and press from there. I’ve been reading though (from SS 3rd Edition) that you really want to have a narrower grip, like hand starting right at the beginning of the knurl. I tried that today with some light weight. Started with the bar, and worked up to about 70% of my 1rm, and did a few sets of 6.</p>

<p>I find it really hard to get into position. I’m about 5’11 229lbs. I feel like it causes a lot of stress on my wrists. I checked my form from the side and front via video to come to this conclusion. The only way I can get the bar to touch my delts/chest is by hyperextending my back a little bit. Another thing about the side view, its really hard for me to get my forearms under the bar enough to make my forearms vertical from the side. (and not be behind the bar)</p>

<p>I was hoping you had some tips for getting into a good press position. Maybe some mob tips? Work through it until I get used to it? Wrap my wrists? Lose some damn weight? All/some of the above? (Planning on doing more conditioning/dieting to lose weight again, in January when I’m finished with Smolov intense). I must say though this definitely feels stronger on the ascent for the rep, but at the bottom it is just so incredibly uncomfortable. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks Justin!</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: He finally learned that he needs a more narrow press grip and is hyper extending his back in order to get the bar to touch his delts/chest.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Michael,</p>
<p>I’m being a dick to you, but this is important and I want people to see it.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-not-a-requirement-to-have-the-bar-on-your-delts-or-chest-in-the-press">IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE THE BAR ON YOUR DELTS OR CHEST IN THE PRESS</h2>
<p>I see this ALL of the time and I’ve been meaning to make a video/post on it. I don’t have the third edition of SS, but I’m almost positive that it doesn’t say the bar should be on the delts and chest. Some people may be able to press like that, but it’s dependent on anthropometry (body dimensions).</p>
<p>If the bar is going to be primarily in the heel of the palm (my workshop attendees know this as the Nic Cage) with a closed compact wrist joint, then the bar will most likely not sit on the delts because of how long the forearms are. If you’re lanky or have long arms, assume that you fit this category. You’ll find that most guys who have the bar touching their delt’s and chest have a really shitty wrist position. A shitty wrist position will not apply force as effectively and start distributing force throughout the shoulder joint instead of directly through it; this can result in overuse injuries with prolonged exposure.</p>
<p>Funny thing: I just wrote the previous paragraph before seeing a few comments down that if Michael keeps the bar off his chest, then his wrists hurt. Re-read the grip portion of the press chapter and standby until I create a video on this. It’s possible that Michael needs to address some mobility issues (like front rack and overhead external rotation — these can also help the mid-ROM external rotation of the press), but it sounds like he’s not mechanically sound. </p></p>

<p>So, can you briefly elaborate on this? “RDLs on Monday will do more for you than cleans will.” I’m intrigued – do you mean they’ll do more for my deadlifting performance, or for overall strength/size development? And are you suggesting dropping cleans?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear gumbo,</p>
<p>Despite there being a plethora of books, videos, and websites dedicated to optimal lifting technique — and despite some people doing the lifts for at least a year — I still see trainees who have learned to do everything without the use of their hamstrings. Even when they are low bar squatting two or three times a week and deadlifting once a week, they manage to do it improperly for a variety of reasons (I could write several paragraphs on that alone). The majority of trainees think that if they have a decent or big deadlift, then their posterior chain is solid. Not so.</p>
<p>If every new lifter did RDL’s twice a week for 12 weeks, then the musculature and tensile strength of the hamstrings would be so much more improved that it would augment the squat and deadlift. Or, if now deadlifting was done in that period, it would allow that lifter to do them optimally when they do start deadlifting (since they have an exceptional awareness of their hamstrings).</p>
<p>So, yes, I’m suggesting dropping power cleans — for a little while. Another problem with most programs is that the trainee does too much. If you did RDLs Monday, power cleans Wednesday, and deadlifts Friday, that may be too much if you’re a stupid person and don’t ratchet back the work when you need to (I’m guilty of this too; I did power snatch/deadlift/power clean on M/W/F on my LP). You could do something like 3×5 the RDLs, 4×2 the power cleans, and work up to a HEAVY TRIPLE on the deadlift. But if you’re a linear progression cherry, then keep the deadlift at a set of five for a couple months.</p>

<p>Justin, I fit this description (<em>Edit: he’s referring to Tuesday’s <a href="/blog/2011/12/foot-awareness/" target="_blank">Foot Awareness</a> post</em>), but only in my right foot/leg/hip. I was thinking it was a glute imbalance of some sort causing me to externally rotate my leg, but maybe its bad foot positioning?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Paul,</p>
<p>I admit that biomechanics of the feet is not my forte, but I have some educated opinions. I’m not so sure that there are foot issues as a result of hip imbalances. Why would it be so crazy to assume the opposite? It would depend on the history of the person. Let’s assume it’s someone who started lifting again in life after having a layoff (maybe a break between high school sports and getting a job in the mid twenties). If that person has a funky gait, then the structures in the hip would adapt as a result of the funky gait. Then, they have mobility issues as a result of being wonky for years, and this is represented in their lifting. The lifting probably exacerbates the existing problem by drilling through hundreds, maybe thousands of reps with this subtle weirdness.</p>
<p>It’s a chicken-egg kind of deal, but I don’t think that imbalances cause it, I think the imbalances are the result of weird feet articulation, but the reverse can certainly be true. In your case, there’s no way of knowing. But if you have a hip funkiness and a foot funkiness, then the foot is definitely causing or exacerbating the hip because you’re in a fucked up position. Address it.</p>
<p>IRregardless of what caused what, we need to fix it. As with anything else, there is no quick fix. You’re not squatting 600 tomorrow in the same way you won’t fix your funky foot tomorrow. Foot issues are interesting because you use your foot every single day. Imagine the hundreds of thousands of repetitions your foot has had walking around year after year. If you’re trying to straighten your toes in your gait, you’ll have to get at least a few thousand reps just to feel somewhat comfortable. Then you’ll have to consistently mob all the structures in your lower extremities. We’ll get into this more in some upcoming posts.</p>

<p>Dear Brian,</p>
<p>Shannon’s answer: “I found doing extra grip work did nothing for me, but know of other people it has worked for. The biggest things that improved my grip were – D.O.H deadlifting, Power Cleans with the Axle, tyre flipping and farmers. For deadlifting we warm up d.o.h till we can’t grip the bar, then hook grip till we can’t grip anymore, then mix the grip.”</p>

<p>This is a great vid of Donny Shankle lifting. He jerks from blocks all the way up to 225kg, then hang clean and jerks up to 200kg (the latter is a PR). Then there’s some good fun after all that — watch until the end.</p>

  <p>My mate in Australia, Shannon Green (owner of Warrior Performance – <a href="http://warriorperformance.com.au/coaches" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Warrior-Performance/270265497462" target="_blank">Facebook fan page</a>), competes in strongman with his mates Stuart and Shane. They are all great guys. Shannon is a real sharp guy and has spent a lot of time studying many different aspects of physical performance. He has made, collected, or bought the majority of the implements he would need for strongman training, and I asked him to throw together some information on how to train for it.</p>
<p>Check out this video from when Tom and I visited Shannon’s training dungeon.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7mhIfCWEYQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This first post pertains to what strongman is and what some basic requirements are. A second post will put it all together into a programming template.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><strong>What A Strongman Competition Consists Of</strong></p>
<p>At a bare minimum each strongman competition will contain an event from the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Walking Event</strong> — yoke, farmers, frame, stone/keg carry, Dinnie stones</p>
<p><strong>Pressing event</strong> — log, axle, bar, keg, monster dumbbell, Viking press, stone/block pressing</p>
<p><strong>Hip extension event</strong> — tire flips and deadlift variations (car, axle, bar, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Loading (over a bar or to a platform)</strong> — Atlas stones, Hussafel stone, natural stones, kegs, sand bags, barrels</p>
<p>There will more than likely be more than one of these events in a competition: yoke and farmers, tire flip and deadlift, sometimes two pressing events or two loading events. In some competitions there will be dragging/pushing events (but they aren’t as common as the others) and can include sleds, prowlers, trucks, tires, and frames.</p>
<p><strong>Shannon’s Minimum Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Shannon believes that there trainees should achieve some minimum strength standards before training with implements. This will validate a baseline of strength and injury prevention for a new strongman trainee. The requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>Squat 1.5 x body weight (BW)</p>
<p>Deadlift 2 x BW double overhand without straps (remember that strongman is a heavy grip sport)</p>
<p>Power Clean 1 x BW</p>
<p>Push-Press 1 x BW</p>
<p>Bench Press 1 x BW</p>
<p>Shannon says, “This is the bare minimum; it’s what I call table tennis strength — the minimum strength you need to to compete in table tennis.” Grins.</p>
<p><strong>How To Start Event Training</strong></p>
<p>Now that the strength requirements are met, here are some options on how to start training the events with the appropriate implements.</p>
<p>Option 1 — Regularly meet up with a strongman club. This way you can get coached on technique and train with strongmen/women who are stronger than you; it’ll step your game up. There are strongman clubs all over, so just Google search (Shan suggests trolling Facebook); if you can’t find one, start asking around. Most strongman guys will know each other and can point you in the right direction. Shannon says, “Don’t be afraid to travel. I used to travel 1.5 hours each way on Saturday to do my event training when I first started and I know guys that traveled farther than that. If this is too hard, then pull your skirt up!”</p>
<p>Option 2 — If time is an issue, go once every two or three weeks to train the implements and spend the rest of your time at the gym under the bar getting stronger.</p>
<p>Option 3 — Buy or make the equipment yourself. This can be quite expensive and you’ll need a place to store it. Shannon says, “If this is what you want to do, I suggest buying one piece of equipment and mastering it before adding another to your arsenal.” It’ll space out your purchases too.</p>
<p><strong>Which Events Should You Focus On First?</strong></p>
<p>Shannon suggests starting with farmer’s walks first (he just calls them “farmahs” in his Aussie accent). Next get a log for pressing movements. Tires are a great third option if you have the space; they shouldn’t cost you any money. Look for industrial tire yards (places that deal with tractors and earth moving equipment); they have to pay to have their tires removed so if you pick it up, it saves them some money.</p>
<p>Shannon says, “I’d start with a 200 to 300kg tire. This will help bring up your grip and back for stone lifting — we don’t let anyone in our gym lift stones until they are good at tire flipping.”</p>
<p>The next purchase should be a stone mold (<a href="http://www.slatershardware.com/" target="_blank">Slater’s Hardware</a> sells them). Shannon says, “Make the lightest stone you can from a 16-18″ mold and practice the technique. Once you can comfortably rep that one, make a bigger one.”</p>
<p>The next purchase would be a yoke, but it’s not necessary to buy unless you’re serious. Shannon says, “You can walk up and down the street with a barbell on your back. I know guys who have done this and never used a yoke until comp time. The beauty is that you can’t put it down. Pick it up out of the squat stands, walk away, and then walk it back.”</p>
<p><strong>Shannon’s Message</strong></p>
<p>“If you want to compete, then don’t get worked up about what the events are in each comp. It’s really not important since they carry over to each other. The deadlift will help your tire flip and vice versa — the same goes for the walking and pressing events. Strongman is a whole body sport and the goal is to be strong as fuck all over. You just need to rock up to a comp, pick up some weird shaped objects, scream and yell to summon Odin and Thor. Then when you’re done, throw a couple of chicks on each shoulder and go eat steaks and get stuck in a meat coma.”</p>
<p>Thanks for the input, Shan. The next post will put everything together into a strongman training template. We’ll also do some stuff on grip work and any other topics you guys are interested in. Also, Shannon, please tell Johnson I miss him:</p>

  <p>Movement on Earth is dependent on articulation with the ground. Human locomotion occurs because our body applies force with the feet into the ground and all motion, athletics, and training are dependent on how efficiently this occurs. Despite fast improvements in performance in recent history, there has been an equal increase in dysfunction in the average body.</p>
<p><strong>Duck Footed</strong></p>
<p>I’ve always hated when people walk duck footed because it looks lazy, unnatural, and inefficient. I’ve noticed that I see it a lot in people who don’t have an athletic background. Dancers often do it because they are taught to be externally rotated in the hip constantly. It often results in collapsing the arch via ‘navicular drop’– the navicular is just a bone behind the base of the big toe on the inside of the foot and this term merely means it has dropped to the floor because of a lack of an arch (see picture below). Going barefoot or wearing flip flops a lot can also cause arch issues. Walking duck footed, or externally rotated in the hip, can also result in excessive loading of the hips instead of distributing the load evenly throughout the entire leg, hip, and trunk.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/12/flatarch1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5990" data-permalink="/blog/2011/12/foot-awareness/flatarch1/" data-orig-file="/2011/12/flatarch1.jpg" data-orig-size="200,294" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="flatarch1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/12/flatarch1.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/12/flatarch1.jpg" src="/2011/12/flatarch1.jpg" alt="" title="flatarch1" width="200" height="294" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5990" /></a></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><strong>Why Does It Matter?</strong></p>
<p>Lifting is dependent on efficient force transfer. When the toes are pointed out and the arch collapses, the tibia/knee/hip internally rotates. If you squat with this internal rotation, then it places more stress on the medial aspect of the knee as well as distal quads instead of distributing the loud through the rest of the knee extensors and utilizing the hip extensors efficiently (not to mention the adductors of the inner thigh won’t be stretched to help extend the hip and the hip’s external rotators won’t be contracted to improve the tightness around the hip). Not only is it less efficient, but it’s injurious in a variety of ways because of where it shifts the stress of the force. Knees can get irritated, especially if they aren’t actively shoved out or the knees shift forward at the bottom of a squat because the stress is pin pointed on one side instead of moving through the joint evenly. Primary hip flexors like the rectus femoris, TFL, and parts of the glute medius can also get irritated from the knees shifting forward and in. The lumbar may also not be in proper extension when the knees collapse and some back issues can arise. In other words, problems can reverberate up from the knee all the way to the back as a result of a poor foot position.</p>
<p>If the load isn’t distributed evenly throughout the structures, then the muscles won’t get worked as well and the efficacy of strength training is blunted. In lifting, efficiency = safety = efficacy = strength.</p>
<p><strong>How To Fix Funky Foot Position</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you can do is stop walking with the toes pointed out. Point them forward. It will feel weird as hell at first, but you have to do it consistently enough to make it a habit. Consider the thousands of repetitions that occurred to make the “toes out/duck” position a habit; we need to reverse that. Improvement in toe position will help walking and running. Take a look at <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/11/episode-343365-stop-walking-like-the-duck-you-arent.html" target="_blank">this post/video</a> by Kelly Starrett for more on efficient gait mechanics.</p>
<p>While keeping the toes forward (in walking, standing, or running), think about loading the outside of your foot. Loading the outside of the foot will prevent that ‘navicular drop’, or arch collapse, and improve the knee and subsequent hip position. It also activates some other muscles in the shank (lower leg) while shifting where the force is applied. Definitely look at <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/12/episode-349365-what-if-we-just-used-a-joint-stabilityfunction-approach.html" target="_blank">this post/video</a> by Kelly to see an example of the difference between good and bad arch positions. Kelly shows that when you actively put the weight on the outside of your foot, the knees won’t collapse during a squat. It’s a combination of distributing the force appropriately through the thigh and hips and putting the structures in a better position to externally rotate at the hip. This is what “improving torque at the hip” means — a phrase used by Kelly in his videos. If you’ve been having trouble with your squat, pay attention to this concept and apply it in your training.</p>
<p>If you’re the type of person that has some knee pain when descending or climbing stairs, and you don’t have pre-existing injuries, then it isn’t something that is “natural” (especially for younger folks). It’s possible to reduce pain by a) improving positioning to distribute the force more efficiently and b) adapting the structures of the knee to withstand stress like running or jumping. The former is discussed in <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/11/episode-343365-stop-walking-like-the-duck-you-arent.html" target="_blank">this post/video</a> and primarily focuses on the same “lateral foot” and “knees out” concept. The “adapting the knees so they don’t hurt from jumping/running/etc.” discussion leaves the scope of this post, but constitutes a slow and steady progressions into activity that stresses the knees.</p>
<p>This post introduces the concept that foot articulation with the ground will dictate the body’s mechanics whether it’s squatting or walking. Soon I’ll do a post on foot drills and exercises that will help strengthen the arch and lower leg as well as help reverse the navicular drop habit.</p>

  <p>I’m interested in looking at information from female lifters. I’ve been observing the difference between the Volume and Intensity Days in the Texas Method for a while. Recently I started thinking in terms of percent instead of absolute weight; reducing the Volume Day weight to a certain percent of the Intensity Day weight is more instructive than aiming for a discrepancy between the weight lifted.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/12/sh4803.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5986" data-permalink="/blog/2011/12/women-stats/sh4803/" data-orig-file="/2011/12/sh4803.jpg" data-orig-size="200,274" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sh4803" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/12/sh4803.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/12/sh4803.jpg" src="/2011/12/sh4803.jpg" alt="" title="sh4803" width="200" height="274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5986" /></a></p>
<p>This led me to start thinking about the differences between female and male lifters. The neuromuscular efficiency of a female lifter is lower than a male’s. In other words, her nervous system cannot utilize motor units as well as a males. The neuron will innervate fewer muscle fibers compared to a male; it’s a result of different sex hormones and characteristics. This means that a female is not capable of lifting her true absolute strength — what her muscle fibers are actually capable of — because it’s always limited by the nervous systems ability to innervate muscle fibers (AKA neuromuscular efficiency).</p>
<p>This means that a girl’s 1RM is relatively lower and as a result she can perform multi-rep sets at a higher percentage of her actual max than a guy. If I can press 240, then I might be able to double 228, or 95% of my max. A girl might be able to do as many as five reps with 95% of her max.</p>
<p>To get more data points, I’d like the females to answer a few questions. Please forward these questions to any friends you have that lift (even periodically in CrossFit).</p>
<p>*<em>1. List the 3 rep maxes (3RMs) of all the lifts you have data on. For example, if you don’t have data for bench, then omit it. If the weight is merely your best triple and not a true 3RM, please indicate this</em>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>List the 5RMs of all the lifts you have data on. If the weight is merely your best set of five and not a true 5RM, please indicate this*.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List the 1RMs of all the lifts you have data on. These 1RMs should be within three months of the above numbers.</p>

<p>I will be very grateful. And since my deadlift lockout is the ugliest thing in lifting history, I was wondering if you think rack pulls might be a good way to clean them up, and if so how do you usually program them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>We talked back and forth about this on the page, but I thought it was good topic for everyone else to see. The federation is the CPF which is a WPC affiliate. Personally I’ve only coached in the USAPL, which is under IPF ruling.</p>
<p>Adam is a glaring example of blatantly removing tension from the hamstrings during the deadlift lockout. I don’t think the last attempt in the second video should have been red lighted, but the excessive forward knee movement emulates what would happen when the bar is hitched. Had the bar stopped moving, I would agree with them, yet it continued to move. Your feet remained in the same place, you locked your knees out at the top, and lifted the chest at the top. That jacked loader on the right was surprised it was red-lighted too. Whatever the problem was, it was something that all three judges agreed on. They must have considered your shitty knee position a hitch, I guess. My suggestion would be to go over the rule book and find out what happened.</p>
<p>However, the fact that you remove hamstring tension is something that you can (and need to) control. Adam told me he’s doing <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CDkQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.70sbig.com%2Fblog%2F2011%2F06%2Fthe-rdl%2F&#038;ei=mIjrTtv8N6SsiQL78cnbBA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHQWP7GnLu3YZ3m7s_YkhTlZCFCYA" target="_blank">RDL</a>s, but I’d still want to see <em>how</em> he’s doing them because I have a hunch he’s flexing his knees too much and not getting the full use of them. In any case, he asked about rack pulls. Rack pulls will definitely help this pulling issue <em>when they are done correctly</em>. The bar should be put right below the knee (at about the tibial tuberosity), and the lower back should remain locked in place during the movement. You don’t need to hyper-extend it (I’ve been hurt this way), but the goal is to not allow it to flex. If it flexes, then it slackens the hamstring tension. Do not allow your knees to shift forward under the bar (like you’re currently doing in your deadlift). By doing it this way, you won’t be able to use as much weight as you think you can, and it will probably be lower than what you deadlift. This is fine. Chris’ set of five on rack pulls is still below what his max is.</p>
<p>Lastly, when you do actually deadlift, think about keeping the knees back (cue is “knees back”). Really work on this since a) knees forward is causing you to miss lifts in meets and b) strengthening your hamstrings by maintaining tension during deadlifting and rack pulling will make for a stronger deadlift. If you’re confused, see Chris’ 650 miss on his third attempt at USAPL Raw Nationals in 2010 compared to his last three meets: 661, 666, and 677.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2011/06/pull-up-challenge" target="_blank">Your article on weighted pullups</a> is great but I’m not ready for them yet, as I’m only doing 3×5 at bodyweight. I know this is discussed all over the net, but I’d appreciate the 70s Big recommendation.</p>

<p>Details: I’m doing SS (A day: squat/bench/dead, B day: squat, press, clean) and I’m doing three sets of unweighted pullups on A days with 2 minutes rest between sets. I’ve been getting ~5,5,6. The most I can do in one all out set is 7 reps. Do you recommend ladders or pyramids? Or just doing them more frequently, grease-the-groove style? Or a couple of weighted singles? Also, the pullups are the only assistance work I’m doing now. Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear gumbo,</p>
<p>If you aren’t progressing much with the “three sets of as many reps as you can do”, then there a few other options. The first is to use the frequency method. It’s essentially the same thing as <a href="/blog/2011/12/developing-a-pull-up/#comments" target="_blank">this Monday’s pull-up post</a>, and Johnny Pain has written about it extensively in his Greyskull LP e-book. Basically consistently do them throughout the day every day.</p>
<p>You could also ladder them in a given workout. Do a single, then rest a sec, then a double, and so on until you fail. Then rest, and try another ladder. Record your total reps and aim to increase that. Another method is to do a higher number of smaller sets. If you can only do 3×5 right now (totaling 15), then do ten doubles (totaling 20). Do a single every thirty seconds, a double on the minute, or something like that. Your goal should be to increase the daily allotment whether it’s every day, or just on your training days. Once the body weight numbers go up, you can start throwing in some weighted stuff, even if it’s light. You could make one day body weight and another weighted, but I suggest using the above techniques before doing this.</p>
<p>Now that the pull-up shit is out of the way, let’s correct your template. You’re alternating cleans and deadlifts every workout. That shit won’t work beyond a month or so, especially when squatting 3 days a week. I don’t know why this isn’t talked about more, but deadlifting more than once a week is a good way to drive the dick into the ground. And even if someone is “so novice” that they can deadlift more than once a week, that just means they are using such a light weight that it isn’t much of a stress. Besides, RDLs are probably going to be much better for a novice anyway since even experienced lifters still don’t deadlift well (observe Adam above).</p>
<p>Deadlift and clean just once a week. I suggest deadlifting Friday; any earlier in the week and it can interfere with everything else. Also, RDLs on Monday will do more for you than cleans will; something to think about.</p>

<p>Justin, can you elaborate a bit on the acute vs obtuse angles of attachment? I assume you’re referring to the lat/humerus relationship, and I was trying to picture it but for some reason (protein coma?) couldn’t get a handle on it.</p>

<p>Dear Wolf,</p>
<p>Look at this sweet pic I drew.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/12/angleofattachment.png"><img data-attachment-id="5972" data-permalink="/blog/2011/12/qa-10/angleofattachment/" data-orig-file="/2011/12/angleofattachment.png" data-orig-size="400,127" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="angleofattachment" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/12/angleofattachment.png" data-large-file="/2011/12/angleofattachment.png" src="/2011/12/angleofattachment.png" alt="" title="angleofattachment" width="400" height="127" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5972" /></a></p>
<p>The black segments are a leg (femur, shank, and foot — the circle is the knee). The blue muscles are small. Take the apex of the blue quad and trace it to the knee; see how that line makes an acute angle with the femur? Now do the same with the red quad. See how that makes a larger angle with respect to the femur? Now consider that the blue and red quads need to shorten, or pull, on the knee joint in order for that shank to be raised (i.e. the knee to extend). It will be more efficient to do so with the red quad since it has a greater attachment angle.</p>
<p>This same concept applies to other joints, yet it gets more complicated since the shoulder and hips aren’t just hinge joints and muscle fibers aren’t always longitudinal with the joint action. Just understand that larger muscles make for better angles of attachment and subsequently more efficient mechanics; that’s a big reason why bigger guys lift bigger weights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deadlift question. I’m trying to figure out optimal feet separation for my DL. Do I want them narrow enough so my arms can hang down straight, thus putting less emphasis on my arms during the pull? Or does it not really matter? Obviously the closer my feet are together the farther one has to pull to complete the rep. thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear lefty,</p>
<p>I think your answer can be answered in <a href="/blog/2011/11/qa-4/" target="_blank">this back issue of Q&amp;A</a>. Generally speaking, a hip width stance will allow the knees to be shoved out more than a wide stance. This will tighten up the hip muscles more as well as allow for a more vertical torso as well as an extended lumbar. In other words the starting position will be better. If the starting position is better, then you’re set up to have a more efficient lift. Efficiency equals strength. Another way of explaining this is Kelly Starrett’s “tunnel” concept; the athlete needs to get in a good position before entering the “movement tunnel” so they can come out of the movement tunnel in a good position.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that if your stance is a little more narrow than what it used to be, your grip will be too. But lettuce be real tea, unless you’re pulling 500+ at a meet, doing things as efficient as possible is more important than doing whatever you can to lift the most weight. Would a novice lifter worry about how they can round their thoracic spine to shorten the overall pull? No. My guess is that you don’t need to worry about the subtle little details that will change your pull length by an inch or so (assuming that is even the case anyway), especially since doing it better will improve your training more than decreasing the pull by a single inch.</p>

<p>Justin,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Off topic, but with winter coming I thought this might be a decent question for everyone. How do you treat a cold to get rid of it ASAP, and how long before you start training again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear wallymoccasins,</p>
<p>This is a good question. I’ve always prided myself on my ability to not get sick. There are things you can do to ensure that your body isn’t susceptible to pansy bacteria that float around. Obviously wash your hands any time you touch something weird, including your penis. I’m real ornery about washing my hands and I know that’s a big reason why I don’t get sick. If you travel via plane or train, aim to clean yourself ASAP (shower, wash hands, etc.)</p>
<p>Here’s a list of things to focus on to prevent and treat sickness. You shouldn’t be surprised to see that it’s the same stuff you should do to recover well. If one of these things is out of whack, fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> Drink mostly water. Do not drink soda. Seriously. Fucking stop it.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep well</strong>. Bare minimum is 7 hours, but get 8 of actual sleep time (don’t count the time it takes to fall asleep).</p>
<p><strong>Consume adequate protein</strong>. At least as many grams as your body weight in pounds. At least.</p>
<p><strong>Take a multivitamin with Vitamin C</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Eat a healthy, low inflammatory diet</strong>. Sticking to a paleo outline will provide nutrient dense foods and help lower overall systemic inflammation. Meat and potatoes ftw.</p>
<p>If you feel any sniffles coming on, increase your Vitamin C and water intake immediately. Make an extra effort to increase the protein. All of this are the building blocks to a healthy system. I’ve always imagined that the water helps flush the system, but it’s necessary for efficient biochemical processes to occur. If you still get hit with a virus despite your efforts, stay hydrated, consume vitamin C, and try and get as much protein as you can. If it’s one of those nasty stomach bugs, get calories any way you can (even if it’s crackers once the initial eruptions settle).</p>
<p>If you did get sick and you missed some training, then follow the advice in <a href="/blog/2011/02/dont-train-sick/" target="_blank"><strong>THIS POST</strong></a> about being sick.</p>
<p>All right, it was fun, I’ll see you guys on the field.</p>
