  <p><em>If you implement anything from this post, you do so at your own risk. Always consult with your physician before any kind of treatment.</em></p>
<p>The best way to avoid injury is to avoid inefficient technique and program effectively. Even subtle form issues can cause problem in the long-term, but especially so if the body is in a perpetual state of under-recovery. If the system and structures aren’t fully recovered, then they can exhibit issues like soreness and pain, but they can also be susceptible to an acute injury. If the structure isn’t 100% and is being used inefficiently, a sub-maximal repetition can cause damage; I talked about it <a href="/blog/2011/02/the-final-stroke/" target="_blank">in this post</a>. In any case, do something wrong with a lack of recovery and it results in shit being jacked up. This post is just a brief review of how to deal with most injuries.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><strong>What Is Hurt?</strong></p>
<p>First order of business is knowing what the hell is actually going on. If you don’t know the name of a structure, that’s okay, but you should at least be able to discern what that area does. Something on the front of your hip is probably a hip flexor. Something on your ass or hamstring is probably a hip extensor. What happened when it got hurt? Under what circumstances or during what movements does it hurt now? This is all information that allows it to be ‘diagnosed’.</p>
<p><strong>Irregardless, Ice It</strong></p>
<p>Last night I heard a guy on ESPN radio say irregardless. If you have any kind of pain after a workout, then ice it. Failure to do so will result in being dropped from the course. But seriously, the way <a href="http://mobilitywod.com" target="_blank">Kelly Starrett </a>goes about this is that if you have pain and you’re not icing it, you don’t have an issue. It isn’t worth addressing if you’re not utilizing the most basic recovery mechanism.</p>
<p>Icing removes heat from the body to decrease inflammation and pain and helps promote healing in the structures. This is especially important in the first 24 hours of an acute injury, but should also be implemented throughout the process of recovery. Any time you rehab structures, ice them after until full, pain-free ROM is achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Is Only Preparatory</strong></p>
<p>I know a guy who has been treating his injured back with heat. This may feel better than icing, but heat promotes inflammation while cold reduces it. Instead, only use heat when preparing for movement. Ligaments don’t receive blood flow, so externally warming them up with a heating pad and then keeping them warm with joint sleeves, clothing, or sweats can help them function normally. Weightlifters and powerlifters will often wear knee sleeves and I’ve had to use heat sources for my shoulders (acromioclavicular joint) and back in order to train or compete in a meet. However, don’t consider heat as a treatment; stick to using ice.</p>
<p><strong>Remember: The Muscle Belly Isn’t Inflexible</strong></p>
<p>An injured muscle shouldn’t be actively stretched. You’ll often see guys who have a calf, hamstring, or quadriceps strain trying to stretch it. The injury itself may have occurred because of inflexibility, but trying to stretch — or elongate the fibers — of a muscle when it’s injured isn’t going to help it heal. Instead, use light, high repetition contractions. Once the initial acute inflammation process has been dealt with (via icing), then mobilize the area via the “mobility” methods we use from <a href="http://mobilitywod.com" target="_blank">MWOD</a>.</p>
<p><strong>General Rehab Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Structures require an adaptive stress to increase in strength, size, or density. Injured structures like muscles and tendons (and to a lesser extent, bones) will obviously not be able to handle their pre-injury stress. The general strategy is to provide a very light stress through a full ROM and see how it adapts over the course of a day. If it feels the same or better, then apply the same stress or a little bit more. Gradually apply more stress as the structure(s) improve, and that’s essentially rehab. Stay patient, don’t be Johnny Badass, and you’ll get back to normal. It can be frustrating being hurt (I’ve had periods of not squatting or pulling for several months at a time), but it’s not the end of the world. Yet.</p>
<p><strong>A Word On Joints</strong></p>
<p>If you’re dealing with internal joint issues in a knee, hip, shoulder, or elbow, then rehabbing it will be different than a mere muscle strain. Joints will typically be out of the scope of what you should try and work on by yourself. However, if it’s an overuse issue caused by lots of work in a program or by doing new movements (i.e. elbows hurting with an increase in snatches or jerks or knees hurt from hiking a mountain), then reduce the work load and slowly adapt over time. Ease into new activities even if they don’t hurt from a muscular perspective. This is why beginners shouldn’t jump into a six-day-a-week Oly program.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing Future Instances</strong></p>
<p>Why did this injury happen? How did it occur? Do your knees move forward throughout a low bar squat rep? That would explain anything from knee pain to hip flexors, TFL, sartorius, gluteus medias, and lower back pain. Your medial elbow hurts? Well, do you have inflexible shoulders? Cause that would explain how a shitty low bar squat grip, clean rack, or press grip could cause that. Good coaching just isn’t to make you stronger; it helps you do the movements with mechanical efficiency so that extraneous stress isn’t placed on the wrong structure. Efficacy is safety. So please, be safe out there.</p>
<p><strong>If You’re Lost On What To Do</strong></p>
<p>You can search MWOD and other popular forums or websites, but you can always ask me or the 70’s Big community in the comments or the Facebook page. Chances are someone has experienced the same injury before and most people will know if actual medical treatment is necessary. Just keep in mind that seeing a doctor supersedes anything else, even if it’s a shitty doctor.</p>

  <p>Chris and Mike did a meet this past weekend and Rory did one about a month ago. We’ll go in chronological order.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2011/10/another-awesome-day/#more-5536" target="_blank">Rory</a> had a goal of breaking the collegiate American squat record in the 198 lb class. Jacob went to the meet to <del datetime="2011-12-14T16:34:02+00:00">touch himself</del> watch, but Rory’s coach/handler didn’t show up! The fuck? After pulling his beard in rage, Jacob stepped in and did a swell job handling Rory in his record setting quest.</p>
<p>Rory primarily used a Smolov squat cycle to get his squat up and pretty much neglected the other lifts. It worked well for him as he broke the record with a 230k (507 lbs) squat on his second attempt, and then got some cues from Jacob to come back and increase his record to 235k (518 lbs):</p>

</div>

<p>**</p>
<p>Chris and Mike didn’t really taper for the meet and used it as a training day. Both had solid days. They ate at a shitty restaurant for breakfast and apparently it wreaked havoc on their stomachs. Chris cites this diarrhea as the primary reason his squats didn’t go as well. He went 622 and 639 on his first and second attempts, then on the third attempt at 650 he farted at the bottom and missed the rep. I’ll also address a small squatting issue in the programming and he’ll definitely hit 660 at the Arnold.</p>
<p>Chris then worked up to a simple 380 on his third attempt bench after not really pausing in training (although he recently doubled 385). On deadlift we did the normal “first attempt is last warm-up” around 585, then an intermediate jump around 622, then he took 307.5k (677) on his third for a routine pull. Chris went 8/9 with two meet PRs and he’s geared to have a great meet at the Arnold.</p>
<p>(There isn’t vid of Chris’ squats, so it’s just his third bench and dead)</p>

</div>

<p>Mike continued his streak of very successful meets going 9/9 and hitting PR’s of 573 on squat, 325 on bench, and 628 on deadlift. Just fucking outstanding. I’ve said this before, but Mike is very in tune with his training. He usually knows exactly what he’s capable of in a meet based on how his training has been going. Lately he has been utilizing ladders on his bench volume and high bar and front squats on his squat volume with a lot of success (they will be discussed in detail in the new e-book).</p>
<p>(This vid is only of Mike’s third attempts)</p>

<p>Great job all around for everyone. Briskin also did a meet and PR’d on everything, although he’s unhappy with his progress. Go to the Facebook Fan Page for some more pictures and shenanigans from Rory/Mike/Chris’ meets.</p>

  <p>Nicu Vlad is one of the greatest weightlifters of all time. He lifted in the 90kg weight class and is most well known for having the heaviest double body weight snatch; he snatched 200 kilos while weighing 100. He won an gold at the 1984 Olympics, placed second in 1988, and placed third in 1996 (when he was 33!). He also placed in the top three in seven World Championships (winning gold in three) and placed in the top two in six European Championships.</p>

<p>There are only a few videos on YouTube of his prowess, and here are two with the best video quality (note the Gordon commentators).</p>

</div>

<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t30SbsPPv00&#038;feature=related" target="_blank">215kg clean and jerk</a> from the same meet.</p>
<p>A few years ago Matt Foreman wrote an excellent <a href="http://www.cathletics.com/articles/article.php?articleID=47" target="_blank">article</a> about Vlad in the Performance Menu. The story under the heading “A quick 185 snatch, then some RDLs…” stood out to me. Foreman was watching Vlad snatch, and Vlad missed 175 twice and then jumped to 180 and missed that twice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will never forget what he did next.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He loaded 185 on the bar. This time, as he stood in front of the bar preparing for the lift, he stood motionless, tilted his head back and closed his eyes in the famous Vlad-concentration pose we had all seen him strike on the platform at the Olympics and world championships. He had not done this before any of the other lifts of his workout, and the gym went completely silent. After ten seconds, he reached down, grabbed the bar, and nailed the easiest, strongest snatch of the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Foreman later found out that 185 was his goal weight for the day, and he pointed out how Vlad didn’t make a big production out of missing the previous reps or getting ready (or “psyched”) for the 185. I admire this trait in Vlad and other weightlifters as it represents maturity and discipline in the mental aspect of training. The ability to mentally induce a hurricane is much more impressive to me than requiring external stimuli like music, slapping, and yelling.</p>
<p>However, I don’t like how Foreman chose to explain it here: “When he got to 185…he just applied an extra level of concentration and focus. It was a big weight, he was having a bad workout, and he needed to tap into his extra reservoir of inner strength, mojo, or whatever you want to call it.”</p>
<p>Foreman and I admire Vlad for the same reasons, but this quick explanation is merely an over simplification on what Vlad was probably doing. Profile studies of the most successful athletes — the elite — show that they score the highest in “vigor”, a summary for strong mental health. This is typically innate in the highest performers, but their ability can be augmented by various mental strategies. World class athletes are typically taught things like arousal regulation, imagery, routines, self talk, and thought stoppage that focus on physical cues or improve concentration, motivation, self confidence, and subsequently performance.</p>
<p>While it’s possible that Vlad closed his eyes and merely gave himself a pump up, I like to think it was a specific psychological method that he regularly uses. The techniques above aren’t just used once in a while; they are practiced hundreds and thousands of times in congruence with the sport itself so that they become as much habit as the sport. For example, if a lifter takes fifteen minutes from each day, relaxes, and visualizes hitting a smooth snatch with whatever his primary cue is (like stabbing the rack position), then when he finally steps back on a platform he has mentally practiced the snatch hundreds of times. He has seen or felt his body perform it, so the lift itself becomes a part of the story that has played out in his head every day. This is just one very specific type of example.</p>
<p>On that particular day, it may have been something as simple as Vlad thinking about wanting to win the 1990 World Championships (Foreman’s stories are from earlier that year). He may have thought about one of his top adversaries lifting better than him. He may have been just been pissed off about missing and was giving himself an ultimatum. Maybe he thought, “Don’t look like a loser in front of these fucking American kids.” Who knows what he thought about, but it wasn’t merely that he “focused harder”. There are many psychological skills that can be implemented whether they are taught or not, and a complete change in performance doesn’t occur from a vague “inner strength”.</p>
<p>Either way, Vlad was an amazing weightlifter and someone whose technique — physical and mental — we should study and learn from.</p>

  <p><em>Mondays consist of posts primarily for or about females.</em></p>
<p>Last Monday I put up a poll asking whether or not the ladies could do a dead hang pull-up. 34% are unable to, 58% can, and the remaining 8% can do a chin-up (underhand/supinated grip). This post focuses on some techniques that can be used to develop a chin or pull-up. But first we have to detail some points about mechanics.</p>
<p>Guys, if you’re bored, this vid is for you.</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><strong>Physics</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Taller girls will always have more trouble with being able to do pull-ups than shorter girls. It’s primarily because taller girls have longer levers and thus worse leverage. The longer limbs will not have as much relative musculature on them compared to shorter girls, and most types of lifting will be more difficult for the taller gal. Longer levers with acute angle attachments are much less efficient than short levers with more obtuse angle attachments. This disheartening reality is present in new lifters; the untrained shorter girls typically have more initial success than untrained taller girls.</p>
<p>But pull-ups are particular challenging for the taller girl because she will also weigh more than the shorter girl. Combine worse leverage with more weight and you get a frustrated girl. It will also take more time to develop musculature on a taller girl compared shorter girl since the musculature has to be distributed over a greater area. This is why Arnold Schwarzenegger’s thighs weren’t particularly huge; he had long femurs. Keep this in mind, because hypertrophy will play a part in this quest. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Chins vs. Pull-ups</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]The underhanded chin-up will be easier to do initially than the pull-up because the angle of the humerus uses a traditional shoulder extension and elbow flexion (that moves anterior to posterior). In comparison, the humerus angle in the pull-up will have about a 45 degree angle and use the lats in a different, yet specific way. Most girls don’t have big, flaring lats that can glide on a warm breeze, so the pull-up is initially more difficult. This means that if the girl can’t do the chin or the pull-up, her focus should be on developing the chin since most girls can do one before an overhand pull-up. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]I did a few posts on getting untrained females to train, so let’s start at the very beginning. Usually untrained females won’t have any decent musculature in their upper body. Whether it’s from atrophy or blatantly ignoring it because “45 minutes on the elliptical” was the primary training stimulus is irrelevant. What <em>is</em> relevant is the need to develop that musculature.</p>
<p>The first thing to try is to put the girl on a pull-up bar and see what she can do. A girl who is 5’3″ and 100 pounds may be able to do one without realizing it (she also doesn’t realize that there are <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_g3tGRzSRwQY/R7c8_26CVGI/AAAAAAAAKHU/16__aD042oM/s400/big-dog-in-car.jpg" target="_blank">dogs who weigh more than her</a>). However, if you’re a guy and you know she’s going to fail miserably, don’t have her try. Sometimes the utter failure can bother the girl so you have to set her up for success.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t go well, then that’s okay; we have a measuring stick. We need to do something that will strengthen and develop musculature to support the chin-up motion. You can use either an assisted pull-up machine or a lat-pulldown machine. Initially, just focus on a few sets of a higher rep range (8 to 10) on each training day. The weight should be progressed so it’s on that threshold of failure given the prescribed reps. Feel free to test the progress on a pull-up bar at the beginning of a workout; sometimes you’ll find that a chin-up comes out of no where (especially for the shorter girls).</p>
<p>Johnny Pain likes to have folks do neutral grip pull downs to develop chinning strength and upper back musculature. I like this, especially initially. However, the problem with the assisted machine and the lat-pulldowns is that it neglects to develop the trunk muscles within the confines of the actual movement on a bar. In other words, the girl will need to stabilize her trunk — mostly with he abs — and the machines don’t allow for this.</p>
<p>Lots of CrossFit gyms use bands wrapped around a pull-up bar, but I don’t like this (mostly cause it can slip off and pop someone in the kisser). When I was at Rippetoe’s gym I used his method of putting a band horizontally in the rack (using the safety support bars) and had the girls stand on that. It works pretty well because the resistance can be adjusted in many ways; the safety bars can be moved up or down in the rack and different combinations of bands can be used. If a rack is available this is a superior way to doing it compared to tying a band over the bar and sticking a knee or foot into the loop.</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Now that the girl has done some introductory exercises, it’s time to get her on the bar. Sometimes a girl can transition from a machine to a completely dead hang chin-up, but the limiting factor is usually specificity with the actual chinup movement. Negatives are the first thing to try as they address the previously mentioned “torso and abdominal stabilization” issue mentioned above as well as the specificity issue.</p>
<p>A negative just means that she starts at the finished part of the ROM and lowers herself down under control. Negative, or eccentric, work is particularly disruptive to muscle cells, so use them sparingly at first (about 8 reps total). Drop them in at the end of the workout and increase the total number of reps gradually. Grip width will typically be at or right inside of shoulder width. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>The Frequency Method</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]If she doesn’t get a chin-up from transitioning into negatives, then start using the negatives with a high frequency. This doesn’t have to be complicated, just do a set number of reps each day when possible. It’s easy to get half the reps in the morning and half at night if there is a doorway pull-up bar installed at home. Last Monday 70’s Big reader meggersp gave her experience with successfully using an organized frequency method.</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2011/12/5883/#comment-21162" target="_blank">meggersp Says:</a></em></p>
<p>I realize Justin is probably going to do a post about girls getting strong enough to do chin-ups/pull-ups, but I’ll chime in with my 2 cents worth anyway.</p>
<p>At the high school where I teach and coach, we’ve had good success with frequency method pull-ups and negatives. We program pull-up work into the regular lifting, but for those who really want to get better at pull-ups, I recommend FM (this is actually why we finally installed a bar outside the weight room – students can drop by during a passing period or during lunch and do some FM pull-ups without someone having to unlock the weight room).</p>
<p>Suppose “Jill” can’t do a pull-up – we use FM negatives in this case. The first week, Jill might do 3 sets of 3 negatives spread throughout the day – perhaps using a mental count of 1-2-3-4 for lowering purposes (she’d do this for 5 days out of the week). The next week, she’d do 4 sets of 3, then 4 x 4, then 5 x 4, etc.</p>
<p>In this process, about once a week, Jill will usually attempt a pull-up to see how things are progressing. Eventually, she nails one. We usually wait to use an actual pull-up in the FM work until she can do 2-3 pull-ups, and then it’s something along the lines of 4-5 sets of 1 pull-up, and each set includes a couple of negatives afterward.</p>
<p>This has worked well for us, and we use it with any guy or girl who wants to improve their pull-ups. It should probably be noted that our students have access to a pull-up bar pretty much all day at school – this is not usually an advantage that most people possess. Also, as has been noted elsewhere, negatives have to be used carefully – we don’t use them with someone who just drops down from the top of the bar. (there’s always ring rows, bar rows, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Developing the top ROM</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show” hide=”Hide “]Last week 70’s Big reader hamburgerfan asked a ‘dickhead’ question that basically said, “Why is this so complicated? Just do them!” Well, brah, some girls have more trouble than others, particularly the taller girls. Up to this point, here is the progression (depending on where the girl needs to start): <strong>use the machines for initial strength and musculature, transition into negatives, and then do negatives with high frequency</strong>. Usually the girl can do a pull-up by now, but there might be one part of the ROM that is holding her back.</p>
<p>In the case of the top ROM holding her back, this is what will help. Start at the finished ROM like a normal negative, do a negative down to the halfway point (or when the elbows are about 90 degrees), and then return back to the top ROM. Then, do a normal negative. So that was down and up through the top half, then down all the way through the full ROM until getting to the bottom. That’s one rep. Use the frequency method on these, and you can call them “Double Negatives”.</p>
<p>If the top ROM was the limiting factor, then it won’t be in two weeks or less. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Developing the bottom ROM</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Read the previous section, then do the same thing for the bottom ROM. Start at the top, drop all the way down, use the stretch reflex out of the bottom to go as high as possible, then negative the rest of the way down. So, do a negative down, rebound and go as high as possible, then negative from that point down followed by a full, regular negative. That’s method A.</p>
<p>Method B would be to start at the bottom (hanging), start the chin and go as high as you can, then negative from that point back to the bottom. Then hop to the top ROM and do a full negative. So try a chin from the bottom and negative down, then do a full, regular negative after.[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Cues</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show ” hide=”Hide “]1. “Drive the elbows down” helps the beginning of a chin. Often girls try to pull with their arms, and this cue will help utilize shoulder extension instead of elbow flexion.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>“Elbows to ribs” helps the lockout for the same reasons as #1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Pull the bar to face” helps with the lockout by keeping the bar as close to the body as possible. Sometimes the girl will lean back in an attempt to lock it out, but she’s just increasing the distance from her shoulder to the bar which increases the leverage and decreases the efficiency. [/spoiler]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of the strength or height of the girl, she needs to use a high frequency practice to develop a chin-up. The trainee can be dropped anywhere on this progression and continue on it until the first chin is achieved:</p>
<p>– use machines (assisted pull-up or lat pulldown) or bands for initial strength/musculature</p>
<p>– switch to negatives</p>
<p>– do negatives with high frequency</p>
<p>– work on the weak ROM</p>

<p>quick question for Justin and anyone else: i have been training for about 2 months now, and my press has just stalled at 125 for about a week now. i can’t seem to get it. i am 18 years old, 155lb power clean, 205 squat, 170 bench. can anyone tell me why this is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear ngalfano13,</p>
<p>Short answer: I’d have to see your program. Let’s assume you’re taking care of recovery (nutrition/protein, sleep, etc.). Are you doing a linear progression? How long have you been training? I’d have to assume it isn’t terribly long. Keep toiling away with 3×5 for at least a couple more months and I’d almost guarantee your lifts, including the press, will go up. If not, then switch to a 3×3 set up for a few weeks and return to the 3×5. If you weren’t doing a 3×5 to begin with, then learn what a linear progression is. Also, adamwathan said this in the comments, which is true: “A 125 press is actually pretty good when you are only benching 170. It’ll go up as you get bigger and stronger at everything else.”</p>

<p>Dear LargeRobert,</p>
<p>Is your name referencing King Robert Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm?</p>
<p>The girls do it as a psyche up. Having a routine in “event sports” (or hitting in baseball, free throws in basketball) is standard for World and Olympic competitors. The routine is often combined with imagery in which the athlete images a successful lift, or perhaps a portion of the lift to cue. You’ll see this with high level athletes. An example is Pisarenko standing in front of his bar before he goes. Sport psychologists can teach that kind of thing, but I bet the Euro coaches teach it regardless of whether they were formally taught or not.</p>
<p>Also, from a psychology perspective, females aren’t aggressive as males. The shout may be a way to heighten arousal (from a psychology perspective, pervert) in order to stimulate the system as part of their routine or mental prep. I talked a little bit about routines in <a href="/blog/2011/09/adrenaline/" target="_blank">this post</a>, but I’ve been meaning to do another post (I studied sport psychology briefly in grad school).</p>

<p>Dear tiny,</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of ketogenic diets, or diets that have a weird, inconsistent feeding. Diets like that aren’t conducive to being strong, powerful, and fast. I’d have to check the chemistry/physiology, but I would rather eat quality food throughout every day to support muscle growth and recovery (being anabolic). More importantly, it’s a giant pain in the ass, and few people will ever fully commit to doing it. Diet is behavior driven, and I’m not going to support something that is a pain in the ass. High quality food diets (Paleo) are much more simple. Eat well and the food takes care of you. You can even tweak the macros to support your training style (since training will dictate the optimum macro requirement). I love <a href="/blog/2010/06/making-the-cut/" target="_blank">this article</a> that Gant wrote about food.</p>

<p>Dear my son,</p>
<p>That first question is an excellent fucking question. As I learn more from Kelly Starrett’s <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/" target="_blank">MobilityWOD</a>, I see how to diagnose and treat different mobility issues. In my opinion, the key to improving function and mobility after the basic ROM stretches is joint approximation. Joint approximation consists of using bands to shift the joint. It can pull the head of the humerus or femur anterior, posterior, or laterally. You can then you implements or the ground to approximate the joint in two direction. For example, lying on your back with a dumbbell or kettlebell in your hand (arm extended vertically) will drive the head of the humerus in the back, or posterior aspect, of the glenoid fossa (the socket of the “ball and socket joint”). Then, when you have the band around the proximal humerus applying lateral tension, you have pushed the femur back into it’s joint while pulling it out from the side. Then you externally rotate the shoulder. That is what Brent calls “The best shoulder mob ever”, and it’s great at improving overhead positioning. In this case it’s a perfect example of joint approximation in two directions.</p>
<p>Joint approximation can be more simple. It can pull the femur forward when in a lunge or in a couch stretch. Joints can also be approximated longitudinally, or down the line. <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/12/episode-348365-restoring-knee-motion-after-a-tweak.html" target="_blank">This recent mob</a> had longitudinal approximation at the knee, and you can do the same thing at the elbow. As soon as I finish this fucking book and update the site, I’m going to do more posts on mobility because improving it is a game changer.</p>
<p>As for your second question, “Sally” and “Nancy” could be some, but those are usually used for guys that are acting like a Nancy. I’ll have to think on this one.</p>

<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>I could clean most of this up in a couple minutes in person. Your toes are probably pointed out a little too far, but I can’t know for sure. But two main things: 1) the timing if funky and 2) you’re fucking talking during the set.</p>
<ol>
<li>Timing? Huh? That’s just a concise way to say that you’re sticking your ass back before you start. Imagine if I had 500 pounds on my back and I stuck my ass back without bending my knees. What would happen to my torso? It would angle forward. Where does the bar go? It moves forward, in front of the middle of the foot. Can you understand why that would make a forward squat? You should, because before you even really start the squat, you’re putting the bar forward.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remedy cue: “Knees out first”. We need the knees and hips to bend together, but that’s the conceptual, and nobody really does it correct if you think that. Instead, you think “knees out first”. I developed that cue cause when someone is doing the fault that you have, they need to think about bending their knees first (an exaggerated cue fixes an exaggerated fault). When they do, it syncs the knees/hips together. However, the person is thinking “knees FORWARD first” instead of “knees first”, so it dicks up the “knees out thing”. So I had to use “knees out first”, and it works in at least 75% of cases (good cues will work with at least 3/4 of the population, and then the other 1/4 may need additional work because they are silly).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You’re fucking talking. It’s not bad that you’re talking, but the fact that you’re talking tells me that you aren’t tight. Dick. It also tells me (although I can see it) that you aren’t pulling your chest up into the chin. You’re also relaxing your torso enough to chat, so you aren’t maintaining the pressure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remedy cue: “Chest into chin”. I’ve been meaning to do a post on this, but you should actively be contracting the upper back muscles to pull the chest into your chin from the lift off to the re-rack. IT SHOULD NEVER DROP. You aren’t even doing this contraction, but if you did, you would drop it because you’re Chatty Cathy. Take a big breath before un-racking the barbell and only have small breath resets in between reps. This will maintain tightness and intra-adbominal/thoracic pressure throughout the set. If you’re losing pressure and tightness, then subsequent reps will be affected since you can’t get as tight under a load as you can before un-racking it. Be methodical.</p>
<p>There is one or two more things I could say to clean it up, but these are the most important things to address in the triage. Your stubbed toe is irrelevant if you have a sucking chest wound.</p>

  <p><em>Note: Read ALL of this before attacking me. This is fair and objective.</em></p>
<p>CrossFit has exponentially increased in popularity over the last 8 years or so. Most of us have been involved with it in some manner, and many people actively dislike it. Any mention of CrossFit will yield a series of (usually deserving) jests and japes in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]My experience with CrossFit started in early 2008 when my Exercise Physiology professor included a picture or video in one of his powerpoint slides. I had heard of CF at this point, yet I looked into a bit further. I was jaded with typical bodybuilding style workouts and had already made plans to incorporate more strength training and power exercises. At the time I weighed about 195 and was working up to a set of 405×6 on high bar squat and could dumbbell press at least a pair of 90 pounds for sets of six. I also ran a 5:31 mile completely de-conditioned — I don’t recommend this (some of you know the story). I was a decent athlete (I power cleaned 305 in high school and played a year of college football before quitting) who finally had a physically challenging endeavor, and I was hooked. My first “Fran” time was 4:00 and the second was 2:30. I followed the main site for a few months and eventually did “Grace” in 2:57, “Angie” in 9:50 (which was almost as fast as Chris Spealler, who weighed 60 pounds less than me — I’ve met him and like him), a sub 7 minute “Helen”, and 25 rounds in “Cindy”. I was pretty good, I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, I started combining strength training with CF style stuff, opened a place while in my first and only semester of grad school, got my CF Level II “certification”, and eventually moved to Texas to run Mark Rippetoe’s gym. During the time I was at Rip’s, I helped with the barbell seminars he conducted for CrossFit, developed my programming, spent a lot of time with various important people in CrossFit (including Greg Glassman), been to many CF gyms, met a lot of good people, and have a unique point of view on everything CrossFit. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Growth of CrossFit</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]In the time I’ve been involved with CF, it has exploded. At various points I’ve calculated out how much money they make a month. In January of 2012, they have 15 Level I Certifications scheduled. My Level I had 70 people at it. Let’s say there’s an average of 35 people at each one. That means there are 525 people paying $1,000 which earns CrossFit $525,000…<em>on Level I certifications alone</em>. Let’s say it costs $25,000 to pay for the travel, lodging, and food of all of the coaches, and CF gets half a million dollars a month. This doesn’t take into consideration any of the specialty seminars, which take at least 30% of the cost, merchandise, affiliation fees, Level II charges, the CF games revenue ($75 a person to spectate), and whatever deal they have with Reebok and ESPN.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear: I’m not saying this is a bad thing. If nothing else, Greg Glassman is the ultimate marketer. Starting as a personal trainer and now earning at least a million dollars a year is fucking impressive. Yes, CF charges a lot for their stuff, but people have and will pay for it. CrossFit is a marketing machine, and that’s impressive. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Why Don’t People Like CrossFit?</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Ah, here we go. There are lots of people who are still new to CF. They don’t understand why IronGarm and the <a href="http://irongarmx.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=1&#038;t=5075&#038;start=28275" target="_blank">Couch Thread</a> destroys CrossFit on a regular basis. <strong><a href="http://joshsgarage.typepad.com/Crossfit_White_Papers_--_Timeline.html" target="_blank">THIS TIMELINE</a></strong> is the ultimate list of why some people hate CF with a seething passion. This list, of course, only points out the bad. It primarily points out all of the negative qualities of Greg Glassman, particularly narcissism, destroying anyone who disagrees with him, burning bridges, and acting like a goober.[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Glassman</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Yes, Glassman acts in a way that will alienate anyone who aren’t his loyal followers. However, I’ve had dinner with him on several occasions (because I was with Rip) and know him probably better than a lot of the “haters”. I never disliked him, although he does act political when in large groups (like at the since discontinued Exercise Science seminars — there were only two). He’s generally a nice guy, kind of rambles some times, and (in my opinion) fell into the trap that rich men have fallen into for centuries: let natural desires flourish because there is more than adequate money to partake in them. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t agree with the way he lambastes people publicly. I’ve seen him pretty drunk (in all fairness, everyone was at least kind of drunk) and maybe fell into some alcoholism for a little bit. I think that his weakness with desires led him to be inconsistent with running his company. He fucked some people over (the reason Rip removed himself from CF) and let his subordinates run things while he kind of basked in the glory. I think the popularity, fame, and earning so much money augmented an existing brash, elitist mentality.</p>
<p>But I see it as protective of his “brand”, even if it’s in an extreme way. We can hate the way he acts, but the way he acts made him successful, and that’s why I think it’s interesting. The bottom line: he’s not so bad once he’s not having to put on a show to pump his brand up. I’m definitely not speaking for Rip, but I think he would agree that Glassman is a good guy to hang out with, eat some food, and drink some beer/wine/scotch/gin with (although apparently he doesn’t really drink gin, despite the jokes). However, none of you will ever hang out with him in such a setting, and it’s understandable to judge him on his actions. His actions, especially in that list above, make him look like a McCarthy/Robespierre tyrant who destroys doubters and steps on people to build himself up. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>HQ</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Like any leader, Glassman created a team to delegate responsibility to so that he didn’t have to do everything himself. CrossFit got so big so fast that this organization was pretty disorganized (as of 2010, I haven’t been around these people since). There is a team of people who directly help out with HQ, and then there is a secondary team that consists of the HQ trainers (this is a very loose summary). HQ would include Nicole Carroll, Tony Budding, Dave Castro, and some others who aren’t in the spotlight or that I don’t know. I’ve been around Nicole (and did a workout with her, Tony, and some others in Rip’s gym at their request — I was drunk and it was midnight), but we didn’t really talk much.</p>
<p>I’ve talked with Tony a few times, had some argumentative discussions, and e-mailed with him for a bit. I don’t know him really well, but I think Tony would at least accept my opinion that he’s a bit weird. He’s done a lot of different things in his life and seemed to fit into a role of developing CF. Fundamentally I disagree with him on various things (hence our discussions, which were always civil), but in the time I chatted with him I felt he was kind of closed off. Tony denied publishing one of my programs in the CF Journal because it wasn’t backed up with evidence (I had lots of success with it), and that irritated me, but I wouldn’t say I hate Tony. He doesn’t utterly destroy people and he’s civil with discussion, even if he’s not open to a non-CF mentality. I disagree with Tony, but I don’t hate him. However, if your only experience with him is seeing him on CrossFit.com, then I can understand that repeating Glassman’s diatribe will give you a negative view of him.</p>
<p>The only person I didn’t really like was Castro. I admit I didn’t really talk to him, but at my Level II he was supposed to be running it, and he kind of chilled on his cell phone the whole time and let Adrian Bozman (who is a legitimate awesome guy) conduct things. I thought that was pretty shitty, but I don’t know the guy.</p>
<p>There are some other people in HQ, like Todd Whitman, who I really liked when I met them. Todd ran my Level II, and then later came to a Barbell Seminar that I was coaching with Rip. He seemed to be attending for HQ as a double agent of sorts, but he’s always a very nice guy and willingly wanting to learn.</p>
<p>I see HQ consisting of people Glassman brought in because they were reliable and friends with Glassman. Realistically, wouldn’t we all do the same thing? I don’t see Nicole and Dave as high quality coaches, despite the fact that they were head of the HQ Trainers, but they can disseminate Glassman’s information to others. I’ve never been coached by them or anything, but I’m very particular about coaching and I would expect more out of the leaders of the pack. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>The Cult-Like Community</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]CrossFit can be fun, especially if you’re a person who hasn’t done anything physically challenging since playing sports, or ever. Athletes enjoy it because it because it provides that difficulty that their training did. Unathletic people like it because it makes them feel athletic. People who never had good social group experiences like it because, even if they are crazy, CF communities are always positive, supportive, and good natured. CF brings people together and makes them compete every day in a society that shies away from competition. The challenge creates a heightened sense of self worth that develops into being an elitist.</p>
<p>Due to how Glassman and HQ conducts themselves, they’ve created a community that acts similarly. The die-hards perceive everything they do as the best. I’ve seen (on the CF forum) people questioning Michael Phelps eating regime and wondering if he could be better if he “ate paleo or zone” (or some shit). CrossFit is always calling out specialized athletes and saying, “I bet you can’t do this” when the reverse is always true. Zealotry and the sense of supreme back-patting is never a good sign, and that’s what CF consists of. People hate CF because of this. This internet presence of “elitism” is why the rest of the world hates everything about CF. And I don’t blame them.</p>
<p>The forum addicts are proud of the fact that they think other populations can’t do what they can do. They revel in the fact that they got injured doing CF. They want to push so hard that they vomit. This only reflects a certain percentage of the CF population, yet the worst part of any population will create the stereotype. For example, there are people probably think that 70’s Big is full of fat guys who think eating ice cream every day is a good idea. But, the bad apples make CF what it is, and I hate this part of CF. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>CrossFit Coaching</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]I’m not a fan. It seems that everything is derived from Glassman’s understanding of how to coach. This isn’t necessarily <em>bad</em>, but it’s not the best. Glassman has some kind of gymnastics background which means he doesn’t have a barbell background. He’s an intelligent guy — I know some of you are snickering, but he really is a smart guy — and was able to soak information about strength training, Olympic weightlifting, kettlebells, and more and apply it into what is “CrossFit”. Yet, as someone who coaches a lot of lifting, things aren’t always mechanically sound and the emphasis on developing technique is silly. CF puts a premium on teaching the body weight movement first, then moving into weighted stuff. Teach an “air squat”. Meticulously break this down, and then move to a PVC pipe. Dick around with this, then move to a bar.</p>
<p>A barbell is infinitely scalable. If someone can do a body weight squat and they want or need to get stronger, then use whatever barbell they can and have them squat every day. The problem with PVC is that the mechanics of the bar-lifter system are completely different with no weight and with weight. There are even problems with emphasizing body weight, or “air” squats; people are taught to extend the hell out of their lumbar spine (whether it be the thoracic/lumbar or lumbar/sacral junction) and are treated like they have a problem if they can’t do it. A bar on the back can help immobile people gain flexibility by pushing them into the bottom of a squat — it happens all of the time.</p>
<p>I could write thousands of words on what I disagree with in how CF teaches movements, what movements they pick (e.g. med-ball cleans) and how they orient them together. I’ve spent a lot of time coaching, observing, studying, and thinking about mechanics of human movement and I don’t think the CF method is ideal.</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>CrossFit Programming</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]I’m not going to dissect this topic. We all know there isn’t any fucking programming in CrossFit. The idea is to adapt to be able to do anything and not one thing. The method to do so is to do things randomly. <strong>CrossFit is a conditioning program, plain and simple.</strong> Glassman and CF have made the claim that anything and everything is just CF, but you can’t put a claim on the realm of training and fitness.</p>
<p>I have a few problems with CrossFit. The conditioning often doesn’t apply an optimal stress and it’s superfluous. It doesn’t have any real element of consistent strength training (and any claim to do so is hypocritical since Gant and I were separately denied our “strength + CF” programs to be included in the CF Journal). It has entirely too much frequency at high intensity and almost always results in injury. It doesn’t follow a logical application of stress to induce adaptation.</p>
<p>This is why it pisses me off when people say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a> is “just CrossFit without saying the name”. That’s fucking ignorant. FIT represents a systematic way to increase fitness by getting stronger and adding in <strong>quality</strong> high intensity endurance training (which I sometimes call “conditioning”). Programs in FIT always include a systematic strength program since it’s the fundamental capacity for all athletic endeavors. Have you ever heard the joke that CrossFit makes men look like women, and women hot? It’s because by only conditioning and not strength training, a guy will atrophy away to a lean 160 pounds (on the other hand, when females do something — anything — they’ll look better than their non-training counterparts). CF has no direction or purpose. It purposely isn’t specific. It’s dumping a bag of shit on the ground and saying, “we’ll use this turd today”. FIT teaches you how to get stronger and more conditioned — the definition of being “fit” — with precise, quality conditioning workouts. There’s a huge discrepancy between FIT and CF. It’s the difference between Vader and Luke, Terran and Zerg, taking a shit and skydiving — they aren’t anything alike. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Is It Really That Bad?</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]No, but parts of CrossFit just piss us off. I agree with Chris Shugart in <a href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_investigative/the_truth_about_crossfit" target="_blank">this T-Nation article</a> (which is a fair synopsis) he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But let’s step back from the Internet pissing contests, politics, lawsuits, and internal drama just a moment and look at the big picture. Right now in America, more than 65 percent of the population is overweight or obese. Kids are dying from adult diseases largely brought on by the basic lack of movement. With those dreary facts in mind, it seems silly to get into bitter debates over any single style of exercising. Allegiances and preferences aside, I’m just glad to see people getting into a gym, whether it’s Gold’s, Curves, or a CrossFit gym in some city’s warehouse district.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CrossFit gets people to do something rather than nothing. It also gets the exercising population to do something better than 45 minutes on the elliptical. I honestly feel sad when I see a pudgy girl or guy spending an hour on cardio equipment. If I could only go up to them and tell them what to do, and that they trust me, they would be better off. The guys fucking around with Smith machine shrugs and triceps press downs could legitimately be more muscular if they were open to hear what I have to say. But I don’t approach these people because they won’t understand. They aren’t ready to swallow the red pill. Seeing CF online or in their gym may spark their interest to the point of trying it. And CF is much better than their alternative. That’s part of the reason why I don’t actively hate on CF; cause it could be worse. They could be doing [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Impact of CrossFit</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Since CF is so popular, it has had quite the effect on all things training and fitness. Ten years ago you couldn’t find many gyms with bumper plates to do the Olympic lifts. The same goes, to a lesser extent, for quality racks, iron plates, and chalk to get stronger with. CF has introduced lifting to thousands of more people, and this is why I will never say “I hate CrossFit”. It would appear that statement is self serving given that my website benefits from lifters who used to (or still) dabble with CF, but I genuinely am pleased that a greater population regularly lifts weights. To me, the epitome of fitness, health, and longevity is to consistently “exercise” (which means lift weights and do conditioning) and eat healthy, and CF helps instill that mindset more than ACSM, ACE, or even the NSCA has ever done.</p>
<p>CF has and will continue to create a subtle shift in the fitness paradigm. It has had an effect on my development and programming as well as the rest of the industry. High intensity conditioning has always been done, but now it’s becoming more mainstream. Kettlebells have exploded into the fitness scene even though most ‘fitness experts’ are still doing stupid shit with them. All in all, the reverberations from CF will only enhance the realm of fitness. Dr. Kilgore and I did some case studies with CF style workouts (in the confines of my programming) and how it relates to oxygen saturation in the blood. CF may push researchers to more thoroughly test the realm of intensity conditioning in a field where low intensity has reigned supreme (check out the endurance chapter in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CB4QFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFit-Lon-Kilgore%2Fdp%2F0615497063&#038;ei=2SLhTq3FCMrKiQKawuyaDw&#038;usg=AFQjCNE7vnWPxoswjFEczwGAqhBcEiu6hQ" target="_blank">FIT</a> if you <a href="http://youtu.be/SMTz9nIUkGc?t=22s" target="_blank">would like to know more</a>).</p>
<p>CF has had a huge influence on lifting. It is a gateway for raw powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting. I’ve made many friends who come from a CF background at various power meets. And weightlifting clearly has seen a boom of interest with the development of CF. At worst we have a greater fan population that can appreciate the difficulty in doing the lifts when watching national or international meets. At best we have a host of new lifters that will compete in a meet, and a large portion of those will stick with it. CF is the best thing to happen to weightlifting in the USA since weightlifting was in the USA. Everyone clearly understands that CF hasn’t built big numbers in powerlifting or weightlifting, yet it filters people into these sports. In order to get decent at either barbell sport, you have to specifically train for them, but CF teaches these movements to men and women who would never have attempted them otherwise. CF benefits the realm of lifting significantly. That puts it ahead of any other fitness organization in my book. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>CrossFit Gyms</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]I’ve been to a lot of CrossFit gyms. Between travelling on my own, barbell seminars with Rip, and conducting my own workshops around the world, I’ve seen quite a few of them. Some gyms stand out better than others. CrossFit Monterey and CrossFit Amarillo have very good strength and conditioning programs (and there are plenty of others). CrossFit Front Range in Denver has a training hall that many weightlifting gyms would love to have. But here’s the thing: even the gyms that don’t have good strength programs ALWAYS have fantastic people. Despite the bad rap that CF gets on the internet (much of it well deserved), when you talk to a person face to face, they are always really kind and genuine people. It’s not uncommon to walk into a CF gym and everyone in the room comes up to you and shakes your hand to say hello. That’s just how it is.</p>
<p><strong>People in CF are willing to help each other out.</strong> One recent example is that I called up Adam at Panhandle CrossFit and asked if I could do a shit-ton of clean and jerks in his gym. While streaming it on the internet. In short shorts. What a weird-ass request, but he let me come in and act like I was at home. You just won’t get that in most communities.</p>
<p><strong>People involved in CF are also willing to learn.</strong> This is my favorite part about the community. Despite criticisms of HQ and not being open to anything new, people who do CF always want to know more and soak up information. As someone who prides himself on coaching and teaching, I really appreciate a room full of eager students who genuinely want to expand their knowledge. I realize it’s easy to disagree with CF’s methodology or way of doing things, but the people are always great. Yes, you’ll run into the internet nut-ball who will mercilessly argue about everything and anything, but the average CFer is usually going to be a good person. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]There are good and bad qualities of CrossFit. Some of you will never get to see the good parts but benefit from the outward ripples (this website is an example). I’ve talked about various people and conceded that they act in ways that I don’t agree with, but for the most part, they aren’t that bad in person. I look at CF for what it is: a conditioning program with a huge community. And let me put it out there so it’s clear: I don’t mind CF. I enjoy how they get made fun of, but I also enjoy making fun of Brent or my brother. CF can piss people off, but it also benefits a lot of people. It’s a nice gateway into other forms of training and the people are always great. [/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>CrossFit is goofy and does some things wrong, but it has some redeeming qualities. I have a unique experience with it that leads me to think about all of this differently than the person who just sees “softball throws for distance” and “we are elite” kind of stuff online. Lots of the gyms are very good. Overall, it could be worse: everyone could be using ellipticals.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask any questions you want. Read the “Introduction” section to see my experience with CF (it includes having the Level II certification).</p>

  <p>Glögg is a term for Nordic mulled wine and is amazing. If you have read <em><a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/wp-content/gallery/gameofthrones/gameofthrones55_660.jpg" target="_blank">A Game of Thrones</a></em> of the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> series, then you may have craved the spiced wine they consume on <a href="http://www.liveforfilms.com/2011/03/game-of-thrones-the-wall.jpg" target="_blank">the wall</a>. This is an excellent drink to warm yourself during the holidays since it is sweet, spicy, and has some liquor added in.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/12/images.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5897" data-permalink="/blog/2011/12/glogg-aka-spiced-wine/images-2/" data-orig-file="/2011/12/images.jpg" data-orig-size="251,201" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="images" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/12/images.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/12/images.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5897" title="images" src="/2011/12/images.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The style of glögg that we’ll be working with is a dry, red wine with a liquor added in (specifically brandy). Typical spices include cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and cardamom (and never in ground form, always in whole form). Sweeteners include fruit (mainly oranges), honey, orange juice, and sugar (white or brown). Then you can add some subtle accessory flavors with blanched almonds or maybe nutmeg (I haven’t tried nutmeg). The amount and type of spices and sweeteners are totally up to you and your taste preference.</p>
<p>You should be able to find a 1.5L bottle of wine for $10 or less at a grocery store. I’ve been told that wines that are about 13.5% alcohol ensure at least a base line of quality (since they were allowed to ferment longer than a lower percent wine). Don’t worry about high quality wine since you’re going to completely alter the flavor anyway. The same goes for brandy; you’re going to use it as an ingredient so don’t spend a lot of doll hairs. The spices should be 3 or 4 doll hairs each. Remember to avoid ground stuff: get cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and allspice pods. I haven’t used cardamom but have seen it in various recipes.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/12/hot-spiced-wine.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5910" data-permalink="/blog/2011/12/glogg-aka-spiced-wine/hot-spiced-wine/" data-orig-file="/2011/12/hot-spiced-wine.jpg" data-orig-size="150,236" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot A3100 IS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1302370091&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.2&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;80&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.3&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hot-spiced-wine" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/12/hot-spiced-wine.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/12/hot-spiced-wine.jpg" src="/2011/12/hot-spiced-wine.jpg" alt="" title="hot-spiced-wine" width="150" height="236" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5910" /></a></p>
<p>The cooking is pretty simple: put all of that stuff in a pot and let it simmer. Don’t simmer it too warm, because then some of the liquid and alcohol will evaporate off (my first attempt had a good simmer, and I lost a bit of the volume). Use the “just a little” approach; use just a little spice, just a little sweetener, and just a little heat because you can always add more when you need to. Below is a good base recipe from my friend Kat who introduced me to glögg (by the way, her husband’s name is Conan…no shit). Kat constantly tinkers with recipes, but I suggest starting with this and tweaking it to your own taste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A base recipe from Kat</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>750 mL of a robust, dry red wine</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>150 mL of inexpensive brandy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1/4 cup pulp free orange juice</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 cinnamon sticks</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 tablespoon of whole allspice pods</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15 blanched almonds</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 drop of vanilla extract</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 dozen whole cloves</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 orange, thick sliced</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 tablespoons honey</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1/4 brown sugar (or less, as desired)</p>
<p>Combine wine, brandy, orange juice, cinnamon sticks, allspice, almonds, and vanilla extract into a large pot. Poke cloves into orange slices and add to mixture. Stir in honey and brown sugar to accommodate taste preference. Simmer approximately 45 minutes. Strain and serve warm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary variables to tweak are spiciness and sweetness. If it was too sweet, then reduce one or all of the sweeteners for a subtle effect, or completely remove it for a significant effect. Just like in programming for lifting, I suggest subtle changes instead of large changes; change too much and you won’t know which ingredient had the most impact.</p>
<p>I didn’t poke the cloves in the orange like Kat said because I’m lazy. My first batch didn’t have allspice in it and I noted that I wanted it to be spicier. The second batch (in the vid) did have allspice, and I didn’t use brown sugar or orange juice, but I did use honey. It was quite spicy and will probably benefit from a little bit of sweetener added in (probably in the form of sugar, but more honey would work).</p>

  <p>I’m busy editing the chapters for the <em>Texas Method: Part II</em> e-book and don’t have anything lifting-related for you. My friend Shawn sent me this video last week and I have saved it for a post since. The speech is about 15 minutes long and I thought it was good enough to share on the site.</p>
<p>In the following video General Peter van Uhm, Chief of the Netherlands Defense Staff, eloquently explains why he chose the gun, instead of the pen or the brush, to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that his son, First Lieutenant Dennis van Uhm, was killed in a roadside bombing in Uruzgan, the southern province of Afghanistan. Some have tried to turn this into a supporting argument for the right to bear arms, but I prefer the General’s direct message.</p>
