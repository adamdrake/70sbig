  <p>Happy PR Friday — Post your training PR’s and updates to the comments. You have about three more weeks for hard training before the Christmas and New Years break, so let us know what your goal is in that span.</p>

<p>Hey, when the hell are you going to consult with me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear you,</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay. I’ve been trying to wrap up two big projects in the midst of doing the whole Thanksgiving thing. I’ll be in contact with you soon, but it will be in order of inquiry. Thank you for your patience. I love you.</p>

<p><em>Hypothetical Question Guy asks:</em></p>
<p>Justin, what does the clean and jerk work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Hypothetical Question Guy,</p>
<p>Since I did 72 of them last night (31 of them at 300 pounds), I can give you a detailed and educated answer on what clean and jerks work. They work the skin of your hands primarily. They also work the skin of your upper chest and collar bone area. Speaking of the collar bones, clean and jerks especially work those. Don’t forget about the skin on your thigh — they work that pretty good too if you’re wearing short shorts and a tank-top (and you should). They also work on your will to live by letting you experience a case of “not fun” so that the next time you’re when you’re not having having fun, you can always put it in perspective and say, “At least I’m not doing (that) again.” I think the military calls that “character building”. Hope this helps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Programming question twofer: It’s been at least 6 weeks (maybe 7) since I’ve been in the gym (wedding, sickness, etc.) and by the time I get over my sinus infection it might be 8. I am/was still on the SS LP, so how much should drop the weights when I get back to training? Also, using the SS LP but with rows instead of cleans, how and when should I integrate curls and chin ups/pull ups into my routine?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear harveymushman,</p>
<p>Bro, you’ve commented on this site long enough to know that it won’t matter too much. But since you’re a regular, and I care about the regulars, I’ll get crayola style for you.</p>
<p>Whenever people come back from a break, even if it’s only a week (due to travelling, but <a href="/blog/2011/02/dont-train-sick/" target="_blank">especially when sick</a>), I call for a light day. The light day should be manageable, since it’s fucking light, and then the next workout can be medium. Then the next workout is either a medium or kinda heavy workout. This usually is a week of training (since it’s three sessions), then the following week you can start with your previous or newly desired program. Don’t get all hasty. It’s like anal sex; ease into it.</p>
<p>As for the curls, they’ll help you get back into lifting shape. I also find curls are good when you have a cold. And when you wake up and when you go to bed and before and after every meal. But if you’re still worried about it, alternate the chins and curls every workout.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Andrew Ramirez asks via Fahzbook (that’s how I say it in my head):</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Justin, I have what is probably going to be a dumb question (yes, I believe there are such things). Which muscle group does the power clean benefit? Granted, I am only power cleaning about 185 lbs but I do not feel a specific muscle hit like I do with squats, presses, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Andrew,</p>
<p>A dumb question would be, “How many fingers will fit?” or “Should I use a condom?” (the answer is no). A good question is, “Did you see my butt? <a href="http://youtu.be/VwAr5m9_iO0?t=3m50s" target="_blank">How was it</a>?”</p>
<p>Maybe you didn’t see my answer above on what is worked in the CJ, so make sure you check that out. If someone is actually jumping correctly on a power clean, they may get some residual hamstring soreness, yet this would only the case for efficient lifters (someone who can clean or power clean a high percentage of their max). For example, it’s difficult to do posterior chain work (low bar squat, RDL, etc.) after I do power cleans or regular cleans because my hamstrings get worked on the second pull. The traps also will get pretty sore from the inherent shrug in the power clean too.</p>
<p>However, most people only lift a low percent of their absolute strength. This person may not get a whole lot of muscular work out of the power clean, but it will still a) work on your skill and b) work on your overall power production. Focus on having a snappy jump, eliminate for inconsistencies, and eventually you’ll handle enough weight to get sore. Also, if you’re only doing a few reps, you won’t get sore either, so…take care of that shit (five triples, seven doubles, or 15 singles).</p>

<p>Hey man, what the FUCK? Your argument for Cushing NOT being a fuck head is to send me a video of the Texans beating the shit out of my Browns? God DAMN IT.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this objectively though. I don’t know his little fairy tale story, but “where he came from” doesn’t mean shit when he constantly acts like a fucking idiot. I mean, he headbutted a guy without a helmet on, and he’s voted team captain? There’s no doubt he’s a good player, but I see a video full of un-funny jokes and narcissism. Look, if the black guys don’t think you’re funny in football, then you couldn’t be more un-funny.</p>

  <p>The first 70’s Big chat in a long time will be tonight at 6:00 PM EST and coincides with the Movember Lift-a-thon I’m doing. I (regrettably) agreed to do one clean and jerk for every $50 raised when we were at the $2700 mark. That means I have 72 reps to do this evening during the chat, and it’ll be streamed live.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a>/<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for updates (in case of problems).</p>
<p>Thanks to Adam at <a href="http://www.panhandlecrossfit.com/" target="_blank">Panhandle CrossFit</a> for allowing me to act like a stooge in his gym tonight.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/get-70-s-big" target="_blank">link to the stream</a> if you want to chat.</p>
<iframe src="http://www.ustream.tv/embed/8977559" width="480" height="296" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: 0px none transparent;"></iframe>
<p>There will be a chance for Q&amp;A during the chat, but most people like to mingle with 70’s Big folk.</p>

  <p>Last Friday one of history’s greatest weightlifters died at the age of 69. Vasily Alekseyev won two Olympic gold medals, eight World Championships, and set 80 World Records. Yes, 80. He was the first man to clean and jerk 500 pounds, and the first to total 600kg (when the clean and press was still in competition). He also had one of the first legitimate power bellies in strength sports. I’ll recap his life by linking various articles that have been published in the last few days, including two by <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Michael Hartman</a> and <a href="http://www.theironsamurai.com/" target="_blank">Nick Horton</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The ‘Babe Ruth’ of Olympic Weightlifting”</strong> is how I described Vasily Alexeev to my wife over the weekend when I learned of his passing. Winning 8 world championships (1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1977), 2 Olympic gold medals (1972 and 1976), while setting 80 World records, and basically going unbeaten for the eight years at the peak of his career is a testament to his strength, power, and ability in the sport…doing so in a very competitive weight class, while being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, and profiled on Wide World of Sports is a testament to his legacy and fame.</p>

<p>“For some performers, there is a psychological problem,” he told Sports Illustrated. “As the weight is greater, the more the mind makes the weight seem to be. But we are from the U.S.S.R., and such a psychological situation is no problem. To successfully lift the weight cannot be avoided. I experience the tortures and the celebration. But I lift as well as I lift because it cannot be avoided.”</p>

<p>This article also details Alekseyev’s dad was a lumberjack, how his last couple meets went, and how he enjoys reading.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Alekseyev" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> talks about his life after lifting, which included coaching and was elected into the IWF Hall of Fame. His <a href="http://chidlovski.net/liftup/l_athleteResult.asp?a_id=5" target="_blank">profile on Lift Up</a> includes all of his World Records and when they were set. During his eight year reign, he hit multiple World Records every year. We will never again see an athlete this dominant in the sport of weightlifting. Rest in peace, Vasily.</p>

  <p>I compiled the results of seven competitors not including me. I expected a few more, but I knew there was only a few non-pussies that read this site anyway. Oh, and domjo54 commented and said that he wanted to do it but didn’t think he’d be fair? What the hell, man? You ate two dinners, so fucking what? This better not be the type of jelly dick reasoning you use to not enter a meet or competition. YOU’RE BETTER THAN THAT.</p>
<p>It was funny seeing the difference in people in the post-eating weigh-in. They were lethargic, possibly drunk, and not as lively. Several of them even commented how their math was totally off (mine was too, but because I forgot my previous weight).</p>
<p>Anyway, I did a little filming for funsies. I’ve never been confused with a competitive eater and only gain two pounds in about 50 minutes. As usual, there’s more to the vid for your enjoyment:</p>

<p>Brian AKA criedthefox wins the “Funniest Video Award”, hands down. Here is his video:</p>

<p>HarveyMushman wrecked shop and won the Absolute Weight Gain Award by gaining 10 pounds in 4 hours (222.6 to 232.6). Despite being larger than most of the competitors, he also gained the most weight as a percentage of body weight (4.49%), but you can only win one award so it goes to someone else. Here’s Harvey’s vid — his wife is funny and he also throws in a “We’re doing it live”:</p>

<p>The shortest pre/post weigh-in was accomplished by Thomas Wywrot, and he gained 5.4 pounds going from 183.8 to 189.2. He wins the Greatest Gain in the Shortest Amount of Time Award. He ate a lot of Ukranian food, which looked awesome. His fiance also hits a front single bi pose at the end. Here’s his vid:</p>

<p>Other notables are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPzSLBdz-Sw" target="_blank">Daren</a>, who sharted while squatting that morning and has a nice Movember stache. He also recently cleaned up his body composition amidst getting stronger but that didn’t stop him from gaining 7.2 pounds and 4.06% BW.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viKO220mXcU" target="_blank">Kittensmash</a>, who almost won funniest video. Watch his first weigh-in (overall, he gains 8.4 lbs, 3.57% BW).</p>
<p>My buddy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhBYuPUIjkg&#038;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Yosh</a> would have won creepiest video since we don’t see his face and he doesn’t talk. He gained 6.8 lbs and 3.51% BW.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for participating.</p>
<p>To the four winners (HarveyMushman, criedthefox, Elliot, and Thomas): Send me an <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a> with the subject “THANKSGIVING WINNER” with what shirt you want and what size. Everyone else refrain from sending me an e-mail and just ask me questions via comments/Facebook/Twitter (more on this another time).</p>

Some of you were extremely generous in donating 100 to $150. Others dropped a few doll hairs, and that’s all we wanted. If everyone put in a few bucks then it would add up (every doll hair counts). Of the 47 team members 26 were able to receive donations that ranged from a single doll hair to 1,085 doll hairs. Some of you have written in to say that you donated directly to friends or family who are undergoing treatment for cancer — this is obviously even better as it directly helps those who are trying to kick cancer in the balls.</p>
<p>Thank you to the team members who stepped up and delivered. The top earners are also good friends of mine: Jacob Cloud ($1,085), Jacob Tsypkin ($946) and Ellee Carlson (who answered the call of female fundraisers to raise $641). Thanks to Cloud, Stroup, and Paul Sousa who have offered their lifting services to raise money. Jacob accepted pledges to pay out x amount per rep of a max set at 315. Here is his video:</p>

</div>

<p>Sousa agreed to watch a Twilight marathon if he broke $300 and agreed to deadlift a max set with whatever value he raised. It ended up being 320 doll hairs, so he pulled that for reps in this video:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Stroup apparently recorded his stuff but was born in the 1800s and can’t figure out how to play the sound? We’re still waiting on his video (he may re-record).</p>
<p>I will be doing my “lift-a-thon” this Thursday at <a href="http://www.panhandlecrossfit.com/" target="_blank">Panhandle Crossfit</a> here in Panama City. I’ll be streaming this event live on <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/user/Get70sBig" target="_blank">my Ustream account</a> <strong>at 6:00 PM EST</strong> (will also embed it here and link to it on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a>). This will consist of me doing clean and jerks with 300 pounds. As of now I have 49 reps to do. I’ll probably do them on a 2 minute clock so there will be time to dick around or field questions. We’ll also be recording on a separate camera for a quality YouTube vid. Oh, and I’ll be wearing a speedo.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who donated but we still have today and tomorrow to accept donations. Do so for the team or one of our members <a href="http://mobro.co/JLascek" target="_blank">HERE</a>. The cash/prize will go to the highest fundraiser who accepts the prize.</p>

  <p>I thought that would get your attention (keep reading). Remember Germany’s Julia Rohde? She’s a 22 year old German weightlifter who made 7th place in the 53kg weight class at the 2008 Olympics (<a href="http://msqdprt.blogspot.com/2011/07/julia-rohde.html" target="_blank">more pictures here</a> and her <a href="http://julia-rohde.com/" target="_blank">website</a>).</p>

<p>You’ll also remember Spain’s <a href="/blog/2011/11/women-at-wwc/" target="_blank">Lidia Valentin</a>, but Spain also has another ravishing lifter named Maria De La Puente.</p>

<p>Julia and Maria competed against each other in the 53kg weight class at the 2008 European Championships (Maria would take silver while Julia took bronze).</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>However, the real reason you’re here is because somebody said “nude”, and Maria De La Puente has posed nude. She did it to prove the point that female weightlifters are not ugly, muscular goons, but instead embody the female form. The following pictures are NSFW, although they don’t show the downstairs mix-up or boobs.</p>

<p>Lest our female readers think this is just an ogling session (they are catching on), this also stands to show that quality lifting won’t induce the bulk, and these girls can be display that to the uneducated potential lifter. That was Maria’s point anyway, because weightlifting isn’t popular in Spain.</p>

  <p>Hey dudes and dudettes, it’s fucking 1:23 AM after Thanksgiving and I’m writing this post. I’m here for you.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can submit weight gain videos throughout the weekend until Sunday at 2359 hrs EST. I’m not going to watch them on Friday, so you may as well have more time to upload.</p>

<p>Dear artesuave (and others who asked about Chris),</p>
<p>Chris uses a double overhand hook grip for all pulling unless he needs straps (I’ve never seen him fail a weight due to grip). I’ve <a href="/blog/2010/04/quick-points-on-grip-strength/" target="_blank">talked about it</a> before a while back. Chris started as an Olympic weightlifter and has large hands, so he’s always pulled his deadlifts like that. I’ve seen him rack pull 600×5 with the hook — pretty insane. Before you go off and try to hook grip everything, just build it up over time because it WILL stress your thumbs. Some hand dimensions may be able to do it with heavy weight either.</p>
<p>When I started weightlifting (and using the hook) I had to tape my thumbs because the skin would tear, but nowadays I don’t. It’s just something you have to adapt to over time. The DOHG with deadlifting will more so stress the thumb ligaments than the skin since there isn’t torsion in the hand to scuff the skin.</p>

<p>Dear ngalfano13,</p>
<p>I had to go back and watch a video of myself to try and see what you were talking about. I’m merely just dropping slightly to catch the weight. If you rack a front squat, and then move into a quarter squat position, this is what I’m doing. If you don’t have as good a position, it could be due to your rack position. <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/?s=front+rack" target="_blank">Here are a list</a> of posts that Kelly has done on the “front rack” position.</p>

<p>Justin, could you impart some advice? [spoiler show=”Show rest of question” hide=”Hide all this shit”]I’ve been working out for ~1 year on the GSLP doing Sat, Mon, Wed (all at my ‘home gym’, Mon &amp; Wed after work). However I now attend football training on Wednesday nights. I’ve tried working out before work but find this really difficult (I feel weaker first thing in the morning, often my numbers actually go down from my previous evening workout! Maybe I just need time to adapt?). My schedule is as follows (Mon – Fri work until 6pm, get home at 7pm):</p>

Why do you recommend this over 3×5 sets across each day?</p>

<p>Dear chippy,</p>
<p>RE: weaker in morning training sessions</p>
<p>This isn’t abnormal, especially when you’re adapted to training in the evening. If I were coaching you I would have you eat differently to prep for a morning session and give you time to transition into consistently training in the morning. Also, I wouldn’t have you train on the morning that you have football stuff in the evening. I’d want you fresh for the football sessions regardless of how serious you are with it (don’t know if it’s high school, amateur, etc.).</p>
<p>RE: Greyskull</p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t have you running the GSLP. If you have three football training sessions (WED and SAT evenings and SUN morning) along with a standard work schedule, a regular linear progression is not going to function well. If you only have 100 recovery credits and the total cost of a linear progression + football training + work results in a payment of 125, your dick will be driven into the dirt eventually. If this football training includes contact or bruising, that will limit recovery even more (and increase the need for quality calories).</p>
<p>Also, the higher rep sets could take more out of you. If you were using a relatively medium weight, then the rep sets may not be a big deal. If you are using more challenging weights (where you get 5 to 8 reps on your final sets), then that will be particularly taxing in the context of football and work.</p>
<p>“But work isn’t physically stressful, Justin.” I realize, yet it’s still something you have to go do and requires at least some minimum level of stress that requires your attention and time. It could also constitute you sitting down for a large portion of your day (whether at your desk or while commuting) which will inhibit recovery due to mobility issues.</p>
<p>I’d modify the program and consider a twice a week split while you have three football sessions. You could also have regular training sessions on Saturday and Monday, but then do an assistance day (e.g. rows, RDLs, and chins) on Tuesday (your free day). If we were doing a consult, this would be the first thing I’d suggest (and get your feedback on it).</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to point out that I’m not a fan of deadlifting during a football season or during football training. I don’t know the extent of your football training, yet deadlifting is quite taxing from a localized (specific areas, in this case hamstrings, lumbar, and sacral areas) and systemic perspective. Put simply: doing deadlifts every week will not allow for optimal performance on the field. I’d suggest utilizing power cleans and RDLs until the football sessions decrease in frequency or you reach an “off-season”.</p>
<p><strong>Happy PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Post your training PR’s or updates to the comments. There’s some good football on this weekend; who are you pulling for and why?</p>
<p>All right, it’s 2:03 AM now. Don’t ever say I don’t care.</p>

  <p>Today’s Thanksgiving is an American holiday that is associated with a large feast, football festivities, and generally being thankful. The original holiday didn’t exactly work out like that, and the puritans didn’t dress like Gordons all the time, but it’s too boring to discuss. Instead, let’s talk about the 70’s Big festivities.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/11/800px-RoastTurkey.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5807" data-permalink="/blog/2011/11/national-bulking-day/800px-roastturkey/" data-orig-file="/2011/11/800px-RoastTurkey.jpg" data-orig-size="350,232" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="800px-RoastTurkey" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/11/800px-RoastTurkey.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/11/800px-RoastTurkey.jpg" src="/2011/11/800px-RoastTurkey.jpg" alt="" title="800px-RoastTurkey" width="350" height="232" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5807" /></a></p>
<p>I’m sure our international readers have seen what a Thanksgiving meal looks like in the States, but it typically consists of a roast turkey, potatoes, gravy, cranberries, and other assorted dishes (including dessert). We are going to continue the 70’s Big tradition of having a weight gain challenge. Basically contestants will weigh-in pre/post meal and whoever has gained the most weight wins. Skeptical Sallies will murmur that this is promoting unhealthiness. No it’s not, because it’s only happening for one day and it’s fucking manly. Personally, I adhere to the Paleo diet and consider it the ideal way of eating to transition to after establishing good musculature. But if anyone avoids Thanksgiving’s hearty meals on the account of maintaining a Paleo diet, then I think that’s a bit overboard unless the ‘cheating’ will cause diarrhea (and it can). Thanksgiving meals are typically whole foods anyway, so it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss the rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Weigh-ins must be recorded on video with a valid time source. Since you may not have a scale to use at a relatives (better ask), there is no time restriction with respect to the meal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are entering the contest, you are agreeing to be honorable. Dishonorable people are fuck-heads, and will probably be found out anyway. Dishonorable doesn’t mean you can’t talk shit to other contestants, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same scale must be used in both weigh-ins. This prevents obvious reliability issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload videos to YouTube by 1400 EST on Friday. This should give you enough time and not interfere with family time. Post them to the comments of this post (not the PR Friday post).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The title of the video must be “70’s Big Thanksgiving – (Name)” with (Name) being your name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure to comply with any of these rules will result in disqualification from the contest and awarding of the Expert Shoveller’s Badge.</p>
<p>There will be three types of winners, and each winner will get a 70’s Big t-shirt of their choice.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Absolute weight gain. Whoever gains the most weight. Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Percent of body weight gain. Whoever gains the most weight as a percentage of their body weight. This is here because fat guys can lose/gain lots of weight relative to smaller guys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greatest weight gained in shortest time. This will be measured by the pre/post weigh-in time. Let’s say a guy gains five pounds in 20 minutes…well, that’s a fucking lot of food.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Honorable mention: There may be a prize for the funniest video. I’m the judge of that, so you’ll have to impress me.</p>
<p>Also, Thanksgiving is about being thankful, so go ahead and let us know what you’re thankful for in the comments. I’m thankful for a lot of things, including my family and health — let’s assume everyone is thankful for those things (since not being thankful for those means you’re a god damn serial killer) and talk about other things. I’m thankful for this community. Really can’t say how much of a pleasure it’s been getting to interact and meet a lot of you.</p>
<p>I also have a friend who is going through some chemotherapy, so I’m thankful that they are able to get through the treatments they have experienced so far.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful holiday everyone. I’ll toast one to all of you.</p>

<p>As of this writing, we have raised $3,922. The goal is $5,000. I’m not above wearing a speedo to raise some doll hairs, but only if we eclipse the 5k mark. Here is what a few of us are doing. If anybody else wants to get in on the donation festivities, put it in the comments. Here are the top raisers in the team. I’ll remind you that the best raiser not named Jacob will win cash and prizes.</p>

<p><strong>Justin’s Money Raising</strong></p>
<p>I will be doing one clean and jerk for ever $50 raised starting from the amount when I announced it ($2,700) till the end of the month. So far I have 24 reps to do. I originally said I was going to do 300 lbs, but that may have to change if it gets around 50 reps. I’ll probably do as many as I can at 300 and go from there. I’m not doing them in a row, but instead spacing them out. I’ll probably stream the event as well as record stuff because I’ll be doing it at a local CrossFit. <strong>Also, if we reach $5,000 I’ll do it in a speedo.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jacob’s Money Raising</strong></p>
<p>Jacob is going to do a max set of squats at 315. He’ll take pledges for “amount of doll hairs per rep” prior to the set, and when he finishes, the pledging donators will pay their pledge x reps. <strong>All of Jacob’s efforts are dedicated to his friend Mike Gardner who died of brain cancer. Rest in peace, Mike.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Paul’s Money Raising</strong></p>
<p>Paul said that if he eclipsed $300, then he would watch a Twilight marathon. Jesus Christ. I would never agree to that. I’d rather do a 12 mile ruck in the middle of summer. He’s going to record his thoughts and I’ll put them on the site after.</p>
<p>Paul is also going to do a max rep set of whatever value he raises. Right now he’s at 310, so he’ll add $5 and do 315 for reps if he doesn’t raise anything. If it gets over $440, he’ll attempt a new PR as 440 is his current best.</p>
<p><a href="http://us.movember.com/mospace/1717504/" target="_blank">Donate to Paul here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stroup’s Money Raising</strong></p>
<p>Stroup is doing a squat-a-thon type thing where you can purchase a squat rep with $2 donation. He will also shout whatever obscenity or phrase you want at the top of the rep if you clarify with your donation. He’s up to 12 reps.</p>
<p><a href="http://us.movember.com/mospace/1723662/" target="_blank">Donate to Stroup here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If we don’t raise $5,000, then you’ll have to see Jacob, Stroup, and Paul in a speedo.</strong> I didn’t ask them, and Paul said, “I am far too hairy to don a speedo in public. It would look like I was smuggling Snoop Doggs afro in my shorts.” If we raise 5k doll hairs, then they are off the hook for this.</p>
<p><strong>Bill’s Money raising</strong></p>
<p>Bill Clark is a martial artist and breaks things with his hands. If you donate 10 to $20, he’ll break a brick with your name on it. If you donate $21 or more, he’ll break a coconut with your name on it (he’ll be breaking them with his hands). He’ll video them and upload them to YouTube and I will post them on the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://mobro.co/TheIronPalm" target="_blank">Donate to Bill here</a>.</p>

  <p>I’m so pissed off about the “occupy” movement that I can barely think right now, so let me see if I can get this going. 70’s Big is all about training hard and kicking ass. Everyone is trying to get better whether it is improving their squat, getting more muscular, being a better weightlifter, or even using strength to support their job or hobbies. No matter where you are on the continuum of strength, you’re one of us if you a) train hard, b) want to learn, and c) have a sense of humor. You won’t be chastised for being weak because we’ve all been there, and it’s more about the process of making progress that’s important.</p>
<p>In the end, we realize that the capabilities we have are a direct result of the intensive effort we’ve put into it. We are strong or weak because we have done things that make us strong or weak. Our successes and failures are dependent on our commitment and devotion to get better. This is what bonds us, and it’s a lesson that fucking hippies everywhere need to learn.</p>

<p>However, we all need to keep in mind that zealousness can go too far. We can train too hard and too much. Sometimes I call this “driving your dick into the ground”, but it just means that you are chronically doing too much work to the point that your body can’t recover from it. If a hard training session or week reduces you below baseline, and you can’t recover back up to and exceed that baseline before the next training session, then you are in a deficit of training. Do this consecutively and your deficit deepens and deepens. Eventually, you are in such a deficit that it’ll negatively hit your performance. The hard and frequent work becomes the thing that prevents success, and this is a weird and hard lesson to learn to committed trainees and lifters.</p>
<p>You can also have a situation where you are toeing that line of having a “training deficit”. Each week you may be close to the limit your body can handle given it’s available recovery capabilities. Most of the time the trainee can do something to improve his recovery via eating more protein, quality food, sleeping better, or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF-hAAfzUvw" target="_blank">hittin’ a mob</a>. But there might be a few trainees who have lifted hard and haven’t really given themselves a break. This week is a perfect time to do so.</p>
<p>I am an example of someone that will benefit from a short break. In the template I created, I essentially had three heavy days that had a heavy squat/pull and press each day. It went pretty well for a while; I hit PR’s and gained muscle. But last week I noticed things petering out. I couldn’t snatch or clean and jerk very heavy and the squats were harder. So I lightened last week’s sessions so I could push press 300 yesterday (below), and I’m taking the rest of the week off…and I think you should do the same.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving typically involves spending time with your family while eating and drinking. I encourage everyone to take advantage of this. I eat paleo with occasionally some beer and even less frequently bread (almost always with a burger), but you can bet your ass that I’m going weapons free on Thanksgiving. Let your guard down and enjoy the holiday. Take care of your body, hit some mobs, enjoy the feast and drink, hydrate, and come back next week ready to work. You’ll have about four solid weeks of training before the week of Christmas and New Years where you’ll have another break, so take advantage of this and plan your training to peak before Christmas accordingly</p>
<p>My friend Gant has always said, “I’ve never rested too much” and my friend Eva Twardokens touts rest as the most important variable for athletes, especially as they age. Take it ehsee this week.</p>
<p><em>Besides, you need to get ready for the 70’s Big Thanksgiving Food Challenge where you weigh yourself pre/post eating on camera and upload it to YouTube (the most weight gained will get a t-shirt).</em></p>
