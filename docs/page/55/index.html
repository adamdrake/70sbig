  <p>I’ve only worked directly with a few pregnant women and don’t consider myself to have a lot of experience dealing with this. However, I got an e-mail inquiry from Sarah, wife of Joe (hey Joe), on how best to train through a pregnancy. The interesting part about Sarah’s situation is that she only recently started working out by doing push-ups, pull-ups, and body weight squats. Right as she was about to transition into lifting barbells with Joe in the gym, they found out she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Before we get into Sarah’s specifics, let’s discuss some points about training during a pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Training can and should still occur while pregnant.</strong></p>
<p>There’s no question that good training with quality nutrition improves health. There’s also no question that there’s a baby growing inside of a pregnant woman — I’m pretty sure this is the case. There’s also no question that the health of the woman is going to have an effect on the health of the baby. Thus we can conclude that since “good training and quality nutrition” improve health, it will be provide an optimal set of characteristics for the baby to develop in.</p>
<p><strong>Hard, intense training isn’t necessary.</strong></p>
<p>We’re talking about health as opposed to optimal performance. The mother doesn’t have to train like she’s getting ready for a meet or a Spartan race. She shouldn’t be trying to PR her squat or jumping around excessively when 8 months pregnant. Even if she did want to maintain optimal performance, we know that the female body experiences a steady state of flux. The hormonal response to training will be jumbled up with the natural hormonal changes that occur to create an environment for the baby to grow. In other words, let’s let the system prepare for the baby instead of trying to have an optimal increase in performance.</p>
<p>By using this logic, we can agree that training should occur, but it doesn’t need to be excessive or “super intense” so that we don’t disrupt the biological preparation for the baby. Furthermore, we don’t want to physically bother a developing baby. We don’t want to significantly increase the intra-abdominal or thoracic pressure, and we don’t want to jostle him around in the womb by jumping around like a spaz. We don’t have to “baby” the baby, but we don’t want to give him the equivalent of <a href="http://regretfulmorning.com/2011/05/Randy-Savage-6.gif" target="_blank">elbow dropping</a> him or putting him in the sleeper (<a href="http://stuntgranny.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/summerslam_1991_-_bret_hart_vs_mr_perfect_031.jpg?w=468&#038;h=474" target="_blank">NOBODY GETS OUT OF THE SLEEPER</a>).</p>

    Don't do this to your baby

<p><strong>Lifting weights is still okay.</strong></p>
<p>Yet, as the last section showed, it doesn’t need to be super intensive. I would have a pregnant gal do squats, presses, RDLs, and chin-ups (or whatever assisted equivalent like pull-downs, ring rows, etc.). I’d probably split it into two days and not really worry about the weight increasing. I’d also include conditioning, but the term “conditioning” is relative to the person. If they are un-adapated to anything, then fast walking can act as conditioning. I’d probably prefer to schedule walking, rowing, and stationary cycling for the bulk of conditioning later on in the pregnancy while the earlier stages would still use barbells, implements, and calisthenics. The main theme will be to not do too much, especially in the second half of the pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>The training should change over the course of the pregnancy.</strong></p>
<p>Here is a snippet of an e-mail that I wrote to someone about half a year ago when they asked about training while pregnant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a given workout you probably shouldn’t deplete yourself to the extent that you can…meaning don’t do conditioning till you’re lying on the ground and don’t squat 1RMs and don’t try and get a 20RM with your previous 10RM — keep it all under control so you’re not putting a huge systemic stress on the body. This means that you should leave each training session refreshed. Keep the volume of lifting and conditioning low, and keep an eye on the intensity so that it doesn’t get too out of hand (maybe keep it below 85%?).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Training while pregnant should exist to maintain, or slightly improve the <em>health</em> of the mommy, not the performance. Leaving the gym refreshed and rejuvenated is better than leaving wiped out. Why? Because we don’t want to require a major systemic recovery because the system should be preserved for developing the baby and staving off illness. The mother shouldn’t be in a weakened state because her immune system is now treating her plus the baby. Most people — male or female — don’t understand that the “system” is essentially the same thing as the “immune system”. If the system is depressed, then it’s defenses are lowered and more susceptible to sickness. If you’re constantly sick (or a sniveling Expert Shoveler), then look to see if your training is depressing the system.</p>
<p><strong>Three words: eat right.</strong></p>
<p>A mother’s body should be ready. Along with exercise, she should eat a healthy, nutrient dense diet. At this point, a newly pregnant mother will have read as much as she can about eating when pregnant, now combine that with the quality nutrition information we know about nowadays. Things like eating nutrient dense foods, avoiding processed foods, not eating frivolous carbohydrates, and sticking to quality meat, fats, fruits, and vegetables. It’s okay to give into the weird cravings every now and then, but don’t splurge regularly. <strong>Just because it says “pregNANCY” doesn’t mean you should act like a Nancy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If there was ever a time to take care of your health, this is it.</strong></p>
<p>My mother took her health very seriously when pregnant. Despite her efforts of eating healthy and avoiding anything “bad”, she contracted cytomegalovirus (CMV), a mono-like virus that can have congenital birth defects. This virus is the reason that my older brother is mentally handicapped (yet he is much better off than the majority of kids that are handicapped by CMV). My point is that even when everything is going right, weird things can still happen. Do everything in your power to optimally prepare your body’s health prior to and during the pregnancy so your little babe can be a healthy little butter ball.</p>
<p>Sarah’s situation is no different. She can certainly start learning how to use barbells despite the recent news that she is pregnant. However, she and Joe don’t need to worry about putting weight on the bar every session, and instead should just get quality muscle contractions with some medium conditioning. It’s a perfect opportunity to work on the technique of all of the lifts without the pressure of having to increase the weight on the bar.</p>
<p>To all of you mothers out there: train well, eat healthy, only splurge occasionally, and your baby will pop out with a mustache to make Burt Reynolds jealous.</p>

  <p>Happy PR Friday to you, sir. Or madame. Whatever. Post your PRs and training updates to the comments. Last week I asked what your least favorite lift was, and it seems that most of you hate front squats.</p>
<p>What is your biggest muscular weakness?</p>

<p>This wasn’t really a question, but I just thought I’d point out how a <a href="/blog/2011/10/pressing-a-dead-horse/" target="_blank">proper grip</a> on the press makes it mechanically efficient and properly utilizes the musculature of the triceps and shoulders.</p>

<p>I have stupid-long femurs and a short torso. Conventional DL feels the strongest, but I have to pull around my knees which is definitely not ideal (and makes any set longer than 1 rep a mess). I’ve pulled sumo for ~1 year as (obviously) sumo reduces the impact of femur length.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I still just don’t feel right pulling sumo. Could I theoretically make up for less-than-ideal anthropometry by having very good hip mobility (ie, a large amount of external rotation to get my knees out of the way)? Or would the amount of external rotation required be too hard on the hips?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear Terrible,</p>
<p>You won’t need to “pull around your knees” in a mechanically sound starting position that is followed by “pushing the floor away”. Methinks your butt is too low and stance potentially wide (see <a href="/blog/2011/11/04/" target="_blank">Q&amp;A-4</a> for stance info). If you were able to get your knees out a bit with your shoulders slightly in front of the bar (putting your scapulae over the bar), then push the floor away, then you won’t have this “KNEES KNEES KNEES” business. Long femurs usually means long arms, so you could get by with a grip that is a finger width or so outside of the inside rings (the rings where the knurling starts in the center of the bar). The wider grip would allow your knees to shove out a bit more.</p>
<p>Keep in mind your musculature won’t currently be adapted to lift heavy weight well with the conventional technique if you’ve been doing sumo. In fact, I’d wager you have a hamstring weakness. But, like I said in the reply to your comment, send a video and I can say things definitively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="/blog/2011/11/mens-wwc-stuff/#comment-20762" target="_blank">echo Says:</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A question for Justin: a quick wikipeida WR comparison between the classes shows that the heavier the class the lower the total kg:class kg ratio. For example – the 56kg class shows a total that is 5.44 times the lifters body weight, but the 105kg class is 4.15. Why does this happen? Is it because the lower weight classes are shorter and don’t have to move the weight as far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear echo,</p>
<p>There is not a direct correlation with body weight and strength among a population of lifters. There still is a correlation, but it isn’t linear. As with any physical attribute, there are diminishing returns. It’s just what happens. For example, my Facebook friend Klokov went 196/232 for a 428 total. If it were possible to replicate the 5.44xBW total of the 56kg class, that would mean about a 570 total. If his snatch were 84% of his clean and jerk (like in the WWC a few days ago), that would result in him snatching 260 and clean and jerking 310 to make a 570 total. Numerically we can see that this isn’t possible given that 260 is near the clean and jerk WR.</p>
<p>In any case, how many times the BW a lifter can lift is irrelevant since absolute weight is what matters. And even when it does — like in the Sinclair formula — larger amounts of musculature matter since Akkaev and Klokov (105kg lifters) placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in the Sinclair formula for the WWC.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin, for someone training 2 days per week who wants to try and linearly progress on press and bench, would going to 5×5 sets across be helpful? Just wondering if the bump in volume would offset the reduced frequency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul has decreased his training frequency cause he’s about to be a daddy. I’m not a huge fan of using 5x5s in general, but especially when that lift is only done once a week. The 5×5 inherently uses a low percentage of the 1RM, and creeping it up over time would primarily get someone adapted to lower percentage, high volume lifting. Instead, I’d suggest using one week of an ascending 3×5 and a second week of an ascending 3×3. The bench and press, especially the press, respond well to encountering some heavier weights. In fact, this is the strategy I’ve used for at least 8 months, and I’ve PR’d at 350 on the bench and 240 on the press (with 250 in reach, methinks, but I’m currently focusing on the push-press).</p>
<p>Ascending sets will let you hit a higher weight on the third set, yet it should be done systematically. I suggest using 10 pound jumps as it will allow for more weight on the third compared to only increasing by 5 pounds (15 would be too large, especially on press). If you have a weak press, 10 pounds would be a greater percentage of your lift, so you could always use 7 or 5 pound jumps. I also like 10 pound jumps on the ascending 3×3.</p>
<p>The good thing about this set up is that every 5 or 7 weeks you could always single on up. It’s a way to test the 1RM (if you want), but it also provides an extremely high percentage stress that usually resonates well when going back to the regular press sets. I never systematically used singles; whenever I got into PR territory with the top triple or set of five, I would try a single. Earlier this year I was only hitting around 215 for a triple, and then I used it for a set of five before attempting the 240 press (previous PR was 230). I typically pressed Monday, benched Wednesday, and use weighted dips on Friday (after sn/cj, or something like that).</p>
<p>I write more about this method in the Texas Method: Part 2 e-book that is almost done (I finished writing the last chapter yesterday), so be on the lookout for that.</p>

<p>Dear EVERYONE,</p>
<p>Several of us will be doing something to raise money and reach our goal of $5,000. I will be doing one clean and jerk for every $50 raised (starting with the total on Wednesday morning) at the end of the month, Stroup is going to be deadlifting or something fucking stupid, Cloud is going to be abiding, and Paul Sousa is gonna be watching Twilight (I would never agree to that shit). I really don’t know the specifics despite the fact that Stroup, Cloud, Brent, Briskin, and I chatted for two hours the other night. Tomorrow I’ll put up a post clarifying what we’ll be doing so you know where your donation money is going.</p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been thinking about using snatch grip for my DE Deadlifts for the increased R.O.M. Is this stupid, smart or are you indifferent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear the Mark,</p>
<p>I know that you are a powerlifter, so the first thing that comes to mind is, “How will these benefit you more than regular speed deadlifts?” You’ll use less weight with abnormal mechanics. The good thing with how I would normally program someone with intermediate deadlifting programming is that they pull a full ROM deadlift 3 times a month (with the other week being rack pulls, most likely) and that’s accomplished with speed pulling — more on this in Texas Method Part 2 e-book.</p>
<p>If you are keen to try it, then let me know how it goes. If I were coaching you I’d have you work with regular speed pulls, emphasizing the fast lockout (after the knees) as it’s more applicable. I’d consider snatch grip stuff worthy of a try for a powerlifter later in their advancement, if at all. This doesn’t mean they won’t be beneficial, but after my analysis, I’d rather you use conventional style.</p>
<p>All right, that’s good for today. I’ll see you guys on the field.</p>

  <p>I’m in a hurry today, so this will be quick. Lately there has been more “dicking around” posts because I’ve been juggling various projects. If you e-mailed be about a consultation, I’ll get to you soon, but these projects won’t get done if I keep pushing them back. In the mean time, let’s watch some random vids:</p>
<p>My friend Jake from Chicago sent me this Kazmaier video. I have no idea what the context is, but I know it’s part of a film/documentary called “Tom Magee: Man of Iron”. This is the only part that Kazmaier is in. He seems kind of like a dickhead in this, but he obviously doesn’t act like that anymore. It’s still funny.</p>

<p>Follow the jump for some weightlifting videos. **</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Here is some footage of some 77 and 85 lifters in the training hall at the World Weightlifting Championships from the last couple weeks. Fast.</p>

<p>Here is Rybakov snatching his second and third attempts (175 and 178) in the B session for the 85s. He’s the World Record holder and one gold in the event, yet his cj is low and wasn’t in the A session. He placed 7th overall and cj’d 190, 19kg lower than the best cj.</p>

  <p>This is a list of people already on the 70’s Big Movember Team who are yet to raise any doll hairs:</p>
<p>Will Cook, Wayne Reeder, Ryan Buck, Ryan Berube, Pete Townley, Neil Sater, Luke Smith, Kevin Diaz, Justin Coons, Jeremy Shepard, Jay Stadtfeld and Jake Golovchuk (my homies, c’mon!), J.T. Matherly, Iman Crawford, Foster Scott Devine, Eli Weber, David Sharp, David Hagrety, Daniel Villava, Craig Kilgo, BJ Fox, Bill Clark, Ben Urich, Andrew Swisher, and Aamir Syed.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, if you do your part in raising some doll hairs, it will help 70’s Big reach its goal of $5,000. I challenge each one of you to raise $100.</p>
<p><strong>Women Can Join the Fundraising Team</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t solely a guys-only thing. Women, you can join the 70’s Big Movember Team and help raise money as well. No, you don’t need a friggin’ mustache and I prefer that you don’t have facial hair. If you’re a fan of dicks, cocks, or penises (or the utility thereof), then help us raise money for the cause. This won’t be the first 70’s Big fundraiser, so we’ll scratch your back (although most of us supported breast cancer awareness). I’m sure the few women who join the team will undoubtedly be better at this fundraising stuff than the majority of guys on the team.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: What I mean by this is that women can create a profile just like the guys have. I believe the site calls it being a “MoSista” whereas guys are “MoBros”. You then could join the team like anyone else, and then have people donate to you specifically. When you are a part of the team, that total would go to the team as well. And you could win the money/book/t-shirt prize too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Do you Want</strong></p>
<p>Do you want silly stuff? I’ve got silly stuff for you. Here’s a video of me hitting a mob. There’s no relevance whatsoever, other than I do it with a mustache, but maybe it will give you an idea of the lengths we’re willing to go to raise money. Or something.</p>

<p><strong>Lift-a-thons?</strong></p>
<p>Patrick Stroup, Jacob Cloud, and I have already stated that we’re willing to do some kind of lift-a-thon. Jacob does some deadlifts in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-xihPL0gN4" target="_blank">THIS VIDEO</a>, and Stroup is going to do squats and yell whatever obscenities that you submit with your donation. Instead, I’ll do clean and jerks. I’m thinking that for every $50 raised to the team from this point on (current total is $2,683, we’ll round it to 2,700 to keep it even). If you want a phrase shouted with the weight overhead, then include that in your donation (regardless of the person you donate it to). I’m sure Stroup and Cloud will join back in the fun for lift-a-thons. It’s your chance to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>14 Days of Movember Left</strong></p>
<p>We only have two weeks. In the first two weeks we raised a bit over $2,500, so the goal is to raise $5,000. I’m killing my dignity (see video above) and willing to do up to fifty reps on the clean and jerk. Let’s get it done.</p>

  <p>I didn’t watch most of the Men’s weightlifting. While the lighter weight classes are impressive, I’m just not that interested in watching the smaller guys. I don’t understand why there’s even a 56k class, but the fact that this lightest weight class lifts about the same as me doesn’t help my self-esteem. Besides, the Chinese took gold all those classes. In fact, the damn Chinese had 7 of the top 3 spots in the 56, 62, 69, and 77 weight classes (7 of 12 spots combined). The only close gold battle seems to be in the 62k class, where gold and silver finished with 321 and 320 respectively. The next closest was the 77k class which was separated by 3 kilos, and then the other classes at least had a 5kg discrepancy between gold and silver.</p>
<p>I didn’t watch the 85k class either, and I make not apology. The best total in the 77k class would have placed 4th in the 85 class. The best snatch in the 85s (173) was only 3k more than the best in the 77s (170). Same thing with the clean and jerk, but a 4k difference (209 to 205), and that puts the best total was within 7k. Here’s the 85k clean and jerk session (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBbkKlngNN4&#038;feature=channel_video_title" target="_blank">English TV version</a>).</p>
<p>**This post will be full of pics and vids, so…</p>
<p>.**</p>
<p><strong>94k class</strong></p>
<p>I’m glad I took the time to watch the 94s, because they sure as shit didn’t disappoint. Kazahkstan’s Ilya Ilyin was the favorite going into this session since he won the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but I still didn’t know that much about him. He didn’t make a big splash on the snatch, only taking 181 on his second attempt (he missed 184). Meanwhile three other lifters lifted more than him, including Artem Ivanov, Ilyin’s rival, who took 186 on his third attempt. Ilyin was down by 5kg in the total to Ivanov. At this point, we have a video of the entire clean and jerk session, so don’t read the next paragraph if you don’t want it spoiled.</p>
<p>(Ilyin doesn’t open until <a href="http://youtu.be/YR7KKA4PexA?t=26m9s" target="_blank">26:00</a> into the video)</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>&lt;br/. I&rsquo;ll try to be concise with the ending of this session, but it was highly entertaining. Ilyin hit his opener at 221 like it was nothing (he barely took time to set up, see the link for 26 minutes above). Then two lifters hit 221: Ivanov and MOHAMMADPOURKARKARAGH. No, I didn&rsquo;t smash my keyboard, that&rsquo;s the name of an Iranian lifter. Then six lifters missed lifts between 221 and 225. Then Ilyin comes out and rips 226 on his SECOND attempt. It forced his rival Ivanov to come out and attempt 227. If Ivanov were to hit that third attempt, it would force Ilyin to hit a World Record 232 in order to tie the total and win on body weight (Ilyin was lighter). However, Ivanov missed the weight and Ilyin was able to wave his third attempt and finish with a conservative 407 total &ndash; the same total that Ivanov had, but Ilyin won with a lighter body weight. The Iranian, MOHAMMADPOURKARKARAGH, finished with a pleasant bronze medal at 19 years old.

<p>Ilyin is about 23 years old and exuded confidence throughout the entire session. He seemed to even throw his hands up at Ivanov at one point as he walked behind the curtain after hitting one of his lifts as if to say, “C’mon, bring your A game, brah!” Usually I don’t like cocky or dickhead lifters, but Ilyin instead seemed confident and wanted the challenge. He was a bit amusing at the medal ceremony where he had the Kazakhstan flag draped over his shoulders and he flapped it around. However, once the Kazakhstan anthem started (which sounded like a pirate theme), he broke down and shed some tears. Good performance, and it’ll be fun to watch him next year in London.</p>
<p><strong>105s</strong></p>
<p>This is what I have been waiting for all year. My favorite lifter Dmitry Klokov was finally step back onto the platform. I was legitimately excited. It was like cheering for the Browns, except I knew that there would actually be a good performance.</p>

</div>

<p>You’ll hear Randall J. Strossen commentating in the beginning of the snatch session here. I ranted to the chat room how I didn’t like his commentary. The majority of it is observational in nature, which is disappointing. The English commentator (who is very good) has the “play-by-play” job to describe what’s going on. The “analyst” is supposed to provide analysis on the sport to give an insider’s view on the situation or strategy. Just listen to Strossen’s comment after the first lift of the previous video: he rambles about the guy’s long arms. I’d rather hear some points about mechanics or coaching strategies in the warm-up room. Every now and then he’d cover a vanilla mechanics subject, be he seemed to lack the confidence to say anything definitively, especially with red lighted lifts. This really made me want to commentate a weightlifting meet, especially a close competition like this one.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the broadcast (not shown in video) they showed the lifters in the warm-up room. Poland’s Bartlomiej Bonk was drinking a mug of coffee and held it up while smiling; this made him instantly likeable and I hope he does well in the future. Unfortunately the coffee only resulted in finishing with his 185kg opener (he missed 189 and 190). Some of you may ask, “If he missed 189, why go to 190?” Well, if you miss a lift and choose to do the same weight again, you will have to follow yourself with a two minute rest. If another lifter hasn’t attempted that weight yet, they will go before you. It would look like this:</p>
<p>– You miss 189</p>
<p>– Other lifter’s first attempt at 189</p>
<p>– You attempt 189 again</p>
<p>This doesn’t provide a lot of time to rest for your second shot at 189. Furthermore, if there are a few guys trying 189 and also 190, you can get a bit more rest by moving the weight up. Also, you may have planned to go to 192 or 193 on the third attempt anyway, so moving up may stick with the plan, albeit a lower plan. It also may be a shot to medal in the snatch or stay close in total (the latter is more likely at bigger competitions). This, by the way, is the kind of shit Strossen SHOULD have been talking about. Instead, at one point he said the snatch was “more than just a deadlift and a high pull”. No shit. Instead of describing what a snatch is to the audience, who by now at least has a moderate understanding of the sport, why not explain something like I just did? It could fill the “dead air” of silence that would sometimes occur as a result of Strossen not saying anything. Also, he could have explained how much time is allowed in between missed attempts or how many changes a lifter is allowed to make (it’s two). Okay, /rant.</p>
<p>Finally Klokov opened with an ezpz 187k, and then MACHAVARIANI (who has the HAIRIEST fucking deltoids EVER) took the same weight on his third attempt. Fellow Russian Akkaev then opened with a simple 190, and IT. WAS. ON. The two Russians were vying to best each other in the snatch to help with their total, yet they were’t going to get reckless. Recklessness might be okay at smaller meets, like Russian nationals or the European Championships, but big meets like World Championships and the Olympics put a premium on hitting lifts to make your total go up. Not missing is important.</p>
<p>Klokov took a simple 192 on his second, and then Akkaev, the European Champion, took 195 on his second. Klokov pushed another 4kg and made good on a 196 third attempt. Not to be outdone, Akkaev stepped up and hit 198 on his third attempt to go ahead by 2kg overall. The only three lifters to go 3 for 3 on the snatch were the snatch medal winners with HAIRY DELTS MACHAVARIANI taking the bronze with 187. This was clearly going to be a Russian victory.</p>

    Klokov's 196 third attempt
  </p>
</div>
<p>Clean and jerks session. Don’t read the next couple paragraphs if you don’t want it spoiled.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zksrjQ0EXM4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The clean and jerk began with the normal lower tiered lifters battling it out. Bonk opened with 215 and Klokov opened with an ezpz 220. It was so easy that we were wondering what he was doing, but at World Championships you want to get on the board and force your opponent to also be successful. 221 then acted like a plague, forcing 5 lifters to miss, including Bonk (he would come back and hit it on his third attempt to finish 3/6). Hairy Delts finished on a good note going 3/3 hitting 212, 218, and 222. Delts finished with a good day, going 6/6 and a 409 total, which was surprising because his first snatch looked wobbly and I didn’t think he’d hit his third attempts. He had impressive overhead strength that was definitely augmented by the amount of hair on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Then things got interesting. Akkaev opened at a simple 222, but was largely regarded to be weaker in the clean and jerk than Klokov. Klokov took 225 on his third, forcing Akkaev to make good on his second attempt of 228. Then a Ukranian lifter came out of no where to miss 229 on his second, and then hit it on his third to take bronze overall (he only snatched 181, so this really did come out of no where). Meanwhile, Klokov had called for 235 on the attempts board. I don’t think there’s any doubt that Klokov could hit 235, but I believe it would have been a meet PR (his best was 230 in Beijing). In any case, he was looking great on his lifts and seems like he’s really starting to hit his peak for this Olympic cycle (he took some time off and worked back up — he only went (192/223 at last year’s World Championships). By calling for 235, it would force Akkaev to hit at least 233 on his third to tie the total. In that scenario, Klokov would have to hit 236 to get a 1kg advantage in total since Akkaev was the lighter lifter and would win if they had the same total).</p>
<p>However, you can change your weight twice assuming you submit your original weight change to the judges in time (you have a minute after your successful lift to submit your next attempt, otherwise they increase it automatically by 1kg). You can decrease the weight you call for to a weight that is ABOVE the weight on the platform. For example, if 233 was on the bar, you couldn’t decrease below 233. But if 229 was on the bar and you called for 235, you could decrease to 232…and that’s what Klokov did.</p>
<p>This was weird because we all (including Glenn Pendlay in the chat) that Klokov would force Akkaev to choose a weight and take a crack at it. This would put Klokov in the driver’s seat forcing him to make a clutch lift for the gold. But instead, they chose the strategy to hit the lift and force Akkaev to hit the same weight (since he obviously couldn’t lower the weight). This would push Akkaev’s clean and jerking ability to the limit, but it would also give him the final say to make a clutch lift for the win. Klokov hit his 232 like it wasn’t a big deal.</p>

    Klokov hits his third attempt at 232
  </p>
</div>
<p>The situation was TENSE and TIGHT this whole time. I was confused as to why Klokov wouldn’t force Akkaev to take his third attempt before him — I wanted to see Klokov in the clutch. He didn’t do his patented ‘crazy celebration’ after hitting his 232 because he knew the victory was dependent on Akkaev missing his lift. You never really want to see a lifter miss a lift, but I sure did hope he would. Akkev cleaned it, yet the clean wasn’t as hard as I would have liked. A limit clean would tire him out for the jerk, but that didn’t happen. Then, he popped the jerk overhead and held it in place. No soft elbows and three white lights, Akkaev won the gold medal.</p>
<p>This was disappointing because Klokov hasn’t won a gold medal since the 2005 World Championships in the year after the 2004 Olympics (in other words, it was a weak year — the most competitive years are usually the year before the Olympics). Klokov has been chasing the gold and getting silver in the last few Olympics and World Championships. I bet he would trade this silver for an Olympic gold next year any day of the week, and this meet will help him train as hard as he can to get ready for London.</p>
<p><strong>105+</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t watch this session. Frankly, I don’t really think it’s impressive. The only reason I’ll watch it at the Olympics is because of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLN4OHxfbGQ&#038;feature=related" target="_blank">emotional Steiner gold medal</a> (which still almost makes me cry nearly 4 years later). In any case, the best 105 total would have placed 5th in the 105+ class and places 2 though 4 were only, at most, 9kg heavier. There was only one lifter who stood beyond the rest, and it was Iran’s SALIMIKORDASIABI who snatched a World Record 214kg (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-nlhZ0RR4A" target="_blank">video</a>). Of course, this isn’t the actual World Record, as Antonio Krastev <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD3WP6xQW4Y" target="_blank">did 216</a> a while back (despite looking like a sloppy fucking mess), but the weight classes were restructured and all of the records were thrown out (which is retarded, since it’s a super heavy record). SALIMIKORDASIABI’s total would have been even higher had he hit his third clean and jerk at 260kg (which is 3k shy of <a href="http://youtu.be/OPgLqaXJQMI?t=3m35s" target="_blank">Rezazedeh’s current World Record</a>, which is still lighter than Taranenko’s <a href="http://youtu.be/BQZjC7cNbyE?t=2m" target="_blank">actual WR of 266</a>). SALIMIKORDASIABI would finish with a 250kg clean and jerk and 464 total. He’ll win the gold next year.</p>

  <p>Last week the World Weightlifting Championships occurred and they were very entertaining. The women were pretty impressive; the 75kg class was lifting about what I currently lift. I was a pube away from quitting right there. If you’re a guy, take 80% of your body weight, match that up with the women’s class and observe what they are lifting. If you can’t lift that, then…look man, I don’t know what to tell you. I can’t…I just can’t.</p>
<p>I don’t have any vids of the 75 session itself, but it included Lidia Valentin, who is…a favorite of this site? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3R-GuLphbo" target="_blank">Here’s a video</a> from the 2009 World Championships.</p>

<p>In other news, Julia Rohde is one of those bulky weightlifters who causes women to flee from the sport.

<p>Here are some of the final clean and jerks in the 69kg class. The only women sessions I watched were 69 and 75, and both were impressive. The Chinese lifter who takes 140 for her opener hits a beautiful jerk that drives her very low on her final attempt (I screen capped it on the Fan Page album in case you missed it).</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/tonA903ZiC8" target="_blank">Here are the snatches</a> from that session (in case you’re new, snatch occurs before cj). The best snatch in this class was 118 by Russia’s Oxana Slivenko and she also tied the best cj with 148. Those are some impressive numbers. That 266 total is almost the qualifying total for the 94kg class for the American Open. The best 75kg class lifter finished with 130/163=293 which is about what I could lift. Yikes. A Chinese 75+ lifter hit a 182 clean and jerk, which is just fucking scary. She finished with a 328 total.</p>
<p>There will be more information on the men’s results tomorrow. Thanks to Brian Smith for collecting some info for this post.</p>

  <p>Veteran’s Day is a holiday that is formerly called Armistice Day that commemorates the armistice between the Allies and Germany in World War I. It took effect on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. In the Commonwealth it’s known as Remembrance Day to remember those that have died in the line of duty. In the United States it honors all military veterans.</p>

<p>There are many different types of jobs that military servicemen can hold, but the common theme among them is sacrifice. The infantryman sacrifices for long months in the most barren areas of the world. He sacrifices years of his life in combat zones and sacrifices bodily harm — some more so than others. Some are hit by flak, some are blown up, some are shot. Some are medevaced and some are patched up and step outside the wire again because they can’t bear the thought of letting their friends down. He sacrifices his emotion as he leaves the combat and steps back into civilization. Many sacrifice their ability to un-see their friends falling apart and killed in front of them. Others wish that it were them instead and live with the guilt that they survived and others didn’t.</p>
<p>The medic, the corpsman, the nurse sacrifices daily to keep friends and strangers alive. They may live with the horror of losing someone in their care, whether the victim could have been saved or not. The maintainer works on aircraft, vehicles, and other pieces of equipment that others rely on. They pull extended duty to make the impossible happen whether at home or deployed. They keep the world functioning for pilots and drivers. They provide covering fire as door gunners, they ensure the safety of their cargo, whether it’s human or supplies. They sacrifice back-breaking hours and efforts to assist those in the direct action, often finding themselves in the thick of it.</p>
<p>The special operations units engage in dangerous missions, putting their lives at risk daily for recognition that they will never receive. The things that they accomplish are hardly televised, they will never receive thanks, and often their job isn’t known or understood by a civilian. And they wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>Above all, each soldier, Marine, sailor, and airman sacrifices freedom. They are held to higher standards, meticulous laws and orders. They are taken from their families and often miss their children being born or growing up. They cannot travel on a whim and are underpaid. They lose relationships, break their bodies, and struggle with their memories. They know their country will never fully pay them back for everything that they’ve sacrificed. They lose the freedoms and liberties that a civilian takes for granted, but in the end…they, above all, earn that freedom.</p>
<p>Some veterans still find it odd to be thanked for what they do, but they should know that the thanks is there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At first glance this makes sense. But then I realized that when comparing hip/shoulder width pulls, this will probably turn out to be minor. Your legs being narrower, lengthens the pulling distance because you are standing up taller. Thereby negating the lengthening of the arms by having them more vertical. So unless your anthropometry is really weird (long arms, long femurs, and short tibias), it stands to reason that it would even out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear wreeder,</p>
<p>Your analysis is a correct one, yet it ignores muscular action in this movement. Remember that the more narrow stance allows for more external rotation in the hips (since the knees should be touching the inside of the arms). I’ll remind everyone that this external rotation a) prevents hip impingement with the femur and the ASIS (hip bone) which b) allows the lower back (lumbar/sacral) to be extended better and set for an optimal pulling position compared to a slightly more rounded position had the knees not been pushed out, c) contracts the external rotators creating some torque and tightness around the hips, and d) stretches the adductors and subsequently hamstrings more so that they have tension in the starting position and subsequently in the early part of the pull off the floor.</p>
<p>There was a guy in the 83kg class in the IPF World Championships that had a wide stance and wide grip, and he missed his second and third attempts about three or four inches from lockout. There’s no way to say why this could have been, however the wider grip is not doing him any favors. A lifter who has continuously deadlifted with sub-optimal mechanics will develop musculature to support this movement. Such a lifter may not pull more if he adjusts his feet and grip width, yet most readers here are not advanced to the point of havingbalanced strength and musculature, and following the “stance/grip width” information provided here, they will more fully develop their musculature for general strength or powerlifting.</p>

<p>I have a couple of girls who you could call lifting CFers, one 56 and one 60kg (Louise and Laura). Louise pulls 125×3 and Laura 122.5×3 (Louise is 5’3 and Laura 5’6), but because they’re women I do hold them back more than the guys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear artesuave,</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of any relatively inexperienced lifter (under 12 to 18 months) excessively rounding their back just to pull a heavier weight. Powerlifting is different as the point is to lift more weight, not do it correctly to develop strength evenly through a full ROM. If these girls are not competing and are within my above time frame for <em>consistent lifting</em> (dabbling in CrossFit doesn’t count), then I would rather see them develop their posterior chains so that they can lift correctly. Developing and strengthening the posterior chain will help improve their shitty-round-back-deadlifts anyway.</p>
<p>I see this a lot in CrossFit: girls will have developed quads and no posterior chain due to the vertical emphasis in all squatting within CF (high bar, front squat, overhead, ‘air squat’, lunges, pistols, etc.). Furthermore, they think that just because they can pull decent amounts of weight that their posterior chain is strong. Not so. I have friends who can pull lots of weight, albeit pretty rounded, and they could stand to strengthen their hamstrings (to the benefit of everything, including the deadlift).</p>
<p>Since women typically lack a background in lifting, I will have them <a href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/" target="_blank">RDL</a> consistently (at least once a week). Use 3×8 or 3×10 every week, and focus on the technique and muscle action instead of driving the weight up. Once the weight progression slows, use 3×5 for strength, yet still focusing on the technique. The same goes for guys if they can’t pull heavy weight with decent technique.</p>

<p>Sure. Women typically don’t have good posterior development or strength and often pull with a round back. See the previous question.</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>

<p>I have a question I was hoping you could help me with, for a couple of weeks I’ve been thinking about the nervous system and its role in weightlifting, in essence the question is do you think that it would be helpful to take some sort of supplement to help boost neurotransmitters before workouts? I try to keep supplements to a minimum but in this case I am unsure and would really appreciate your opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Jonas,</p>
<p>It’s a misconception in modern online fitness and strength communities to say “my CNS (central nervous system) is burned out”. This is a silly simplification of a system that that integrates the information that it receives and coordinates the activity of the body. Instead, we should think in terms of the “neuroendocrine system” because it concerns the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. To say, “my CNS is fried” is just a pseudo-intellectual way of saying “I experienced too much stress and now my system is suppressed”. The “achy” feeling that you may have from high volume or high intensity is a combination of the high localized stress imparted on individual muscles or groups of muscles compounded with the fact that recovery processes are in a chronic deficit as a result of not getting a chance to recover and supercompensate.</p>
<p>So, in other words, the nervous system is merely a piece of the giant, complex, fascinating system that makes the body. When we combine this beautiful system with stress to improve its performance, things are even more complicated than they already are. I know this firsthand after seeing a dissected body and observing it’s complexity in anatomical structure. To give you an idea of how complicated metabolism is, look at <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ojAVykXqU5w/TiEuaJK5z6I/AAAAAAAAAEo/o6LbhUeq7ws/s400/Complete+metabolic+map_2.jpg" target="_blank">this thumbnail</a> for a wall map (the map is probably 5×5 in feet, at least). Now compound all of that craziness with how we are applying stress and changing variables through training, eating, supplementation, sleep, stress, rehab, recovery, rest, and more. It’s really fucking complicated, and cannot be simplified in terms of the CNS. So stop saying that (getting off soap box).</p>
<p>Now, going back to Jonas’ question, worrying about what your neurotransmitters are doing is like worrying about the left pinky finger of one soldier of the 300,000 Persians attacking the Greeks at the Battle of Thermopylae — it’s irrelevant. Are you ample enough <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">protein</a>? Are you sleeping at LEAST 8 hours a night? Are you on a good program? Is your body fat under control? Have you been lifting consistently for at least two years? Are you supplementing vitamins, minerals, fish oil, BCAAs, and possibly creatine effectively?</p>
<p>If you answered “no” to any of those questions (along with many more similar questions), then you have no business worrying about this. At all.</p>
<p>All right, well it’s been fun guys. I’ll talk to you here in a little bit. Be on the lookout for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook</a>/<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> posts on the IWF and IPF World Championships.</p>

  <p>Konstantinovs took a hiatus from posting videos on YouTube, yet he seems to be back with a couple of non deadlifting videos. I had read that he was going to go up a weight class and he certainly looks bigger. Check out this pretty simple 551 bench.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_FKwT9si1xo" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The curious thing isn’t that he’s speaking English, it’s that he’s using the slingshot. It’s curious because Konstantinovs is a raw lifter (and known for his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh-ikyBAQr8" target="_blank">deadlift</a> if you’re a noob). I’ve seen Kelly Starrett <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2010/11/episode-94365-bench-as-shoulder-er.html" target="_blank">talk about using the slingshot</a> as well, and he even used it for an excellent “shoulder flexion with external rotation” mob.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howmuchyabench.net/" target="_blank">Mark Bell’s slingshot</a> was designed by Mark Bell to give geared powerlifters another tool to reduce joint stress and inflammation as a result of benching. It also allows them to handle an overload and teaches proper bench positioning — a great tool. He explains how it’s put on and used in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h24sNPIkroI&#038;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
<p>Geared powerlifters will often use a wider grip, wider than you should use for general strength training and sometimes wider than raw powerlifting. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE2aSmCFCjg&#038;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">This video</a> of powerlifters using the slingshot shows some of those wide grips; the fore arms will be angled outside of vertical when at the bottom ROM (most raw lifters should have vertical forearms at the bottom, pretty much like Matt Kroc in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7V43cPALGk" target="_blank">this video</a> of him trying the slingshot out. ). Once training regularly in this position, powerlifters can lift more weight due to the shorter ROM that the bar travels and the assistance of a bench shirt. More weight means victory, yet that bottom position has a lot of mechanical inefficiency that can place some funky stresses in the elbows, pecs, and shoulders.</p>
<p>Most powerlifters, raw or geared, don’t typically do any overhead movements in training (namely the press). I consider this to be an important lift that keeps the shoulder healthy and can help augment the bench by strengthening the triceps and anterior shoulder. I know many powerlifters, even as young as 21 years old, who have bad shoulders that they have to train around. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that anyone I’ve ever coached with (AC, Chris, Mike, etc.) don’t have current shoulder problems. I’ve even rehabbed Chris back from a severe shoulder injury that probably required surgery. All of my raw powerlifting friends will notice shoulder irritation and soreness when they reduce overhead pressing frequency when getting ready for a meet. I deem pressing important for powerlifters, but the point is that most powerlifters don’t press and this is why the slingshot really helps them.</p>
<p>It reduces the stress on the elbows, pecs, and shoulders by allowing the same or similar range of motion, yet helps those joints along their path. However, as Starrett points out in the link above, it helps force the shoulders into maintaining external rotation throughout the lift — something that you should be aiming for anyway. By maintaining external rotation, the structures keep a position that utilizes the triceps and distributes the load throughout the pecs while aiding the upward motion of the bar out of the bottom ROM. And this is why it will also help raw lifters.</p>
<p>I often see some nasty internal rotation on the bench and press, even among intermediate lifters who have been on a TM set up for more than a year (you know who you are). The bench can never flourish when performed with internal rotation, and the slingshot may be a good tool to learn that proper positioning. By chronically using proper externally rotated position — with the slingshot or not — the musculature will develop in a way that allows for proper positioning with heavier loads.</p>
<p>But the slingshot isn’t just something that could help a weak bencher that internally rotates; after all, Konstantinovs is a raw lifter using it for 500+ pound bench training. It’s a great tool for raw lifters too. Mark Bell says that it can allow about a 10% overload on bench. This would allow some overload whether for volume or intensity purposes. It could also help improve the bottom ROM of a bench, particularly with a pause. In higher intermediate or advanced levels of powerlifting, a lifter would identify which part of the ROM is his weak point: bottom, middle, or top. Technically the slingshot could help with all three, but I see even more utility to improve the bottom ROM strength due to the help it gives in that area. A trainee could use the slingshot on their intensity days to overload the musculature and develop the strength in that bottom positioning (this would be similar to using reverse band benches that increase the load at the top ROM to help with the lockout).</p>
<p>In any case, I find the slingshot interesting but I’ve never trained with it or coached anybody with it. Do any of you have experience with this tool? Have you used it? Played with it? Regularly use it? Let us know in the comments, because I’m interested to know more. And if you’re a powerlifter with internal rotation problems or have a few years of experience under your belt and need a training aid, I’d consider purchasing one.</p>
<p><em>Note: I don’t know Mark Bell and am not compensated in any way for this post (although I would advertise it), I just thought it was interesting and would open the discussion for those that have experience with it.</em></p>

  <p>Just because I haven’t mentioned it in a few days doesn’t mean we aren’t busy kicking cancer in the BALLS. THIS ISN’T A GAME. The 70’s Big Movember team has 37 members and has raised $1,720 so far. That’s under $50 a member, so we’re gonna need a better effort out of our current and future members. If we all aim to get at least $100 each, then we’ll plant a much more firm kick to cancer’s balls.</p>
<p><strong>70’s Big Contest</strong></p>
<p><a href="/blog/2011/11/kill-cancer/" target="_blank">Don’t forget</a> that I’m giving the team member that has raised the most doll hairs cash and money prizes. Currently Jacob Tspykin is dominating this contest so far, but we’re only 9 days into November. Here is the top ten thus far:</p>

<p><strong>Anyone can join the 70’s Big Movember Team.</strong></p>
<p>Both guys and girls can join it. And no, you don’t have to grow a mustache (although it helps). Guys are encouraged to grow facial hair or celebrate their beards, yet you don’t HAVE to. If you’re not joining the team and raising money on the account of having to grow facial hair, then it sounds like you like cancer. <strong>This is my formal invitation for all girls and guys that read this site to join the fundraising team</strong> — even if you only raise a few doll hairs, ever doll hair counts.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

  <p>I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Kinesiology with an emphasis in Exercise Science. It’s okay I guess. I knew that I didn’t want to pursue graduate work in this area of study because I wanted to coach, but I wasn’t impressed with the field itself. It’s just so BAD. The exercise prescriptions are ineffective, nobody understands mechanics, and the research is a joke. A lot of people have mentioned how they would like to hear my thoughts on the problems in Exercise Science, and I think it starts with the research.</p>
<p>I’ve had to look at a lot of shitty studies in school, and I can dismantle them all. The articles in various journals, including the NSCA, are usually not very good. Rippetoe and I used to look at several articles and point out how badly they were done. However most studies shouldn’t even be done in the first place because the researchers are asking either an irrelevant question or the wrong question. The majority of studies that are published are irrelevant or easily dismissed because of crappy methodology.</p>
<p>Why am I not doing anything to change this? Because I don’t care. Why would I aim to change the governing boards of organizations that allow bad research on things that don’t matter? I’m busy getting people to perform better and teaching them how to do it. I mean no disrespect to researchers — especially the good ones — but most of them…don’t quite get it. Let’s look at <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/133028228.html" target="_blank">this example</a>.</p>
<p>The title of this news article is, “Squat lifts likely cause of stress fractures in young athletes, study finds”. We’ll soon find why this news article is just as bad as the study itself since this conclusion can’t be drawn. Here is the “<a href="http://www.nassannualmeeting.org/Documents/Teens_Skip_Squat_Lifts_ABSTRACT.pdf" target="_blank">press release study abstract</a>” that the shitty journalist used to write the article. I will be directly referencing this piece of information in the rest of the post since the actual article is not made available (this, by the way, is another flaw in the system: let’s charge money to see the shitty research we’re doing so that nobody can debunk it unless they want to spend $30 to see our boring journals).</p>
<p>Abstract TL;DR — The researchers had patients (who were kids) that said that they hurt their backs while squats, so they performed a study to see if squats caused the “lumbar fractures of the pars interarticularis” that they found. The study itself observed the “pelvic incidence and tilt, sacral</p>
<p>slope, and lumbar lordosis while in normal standing posture and then during a front and back squat” in 20 volunteers. Here is a picture of the author, John McClellan.</p>

<p>Now let’s tear this apart. I’m upset to say that it was too easy. I made notes as I read the abstract itself. The first point I want to make: in my 13 years of training with barbells, playing football in high school and briefly in college, and training and coaching for the majority of it, especially the last five years, I have never seen or heard of this injury (pars interarticularis fracture). There is some merit to this statement as I’ve directly coached at least 50,000 squats in the last couple years and have seen many more over these years (along with performing at least 20,000 in training).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The number of incidence or rate or injury are not included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fracture healing is 3% for bilateral and 25% for unilateral pars fracturees. Sounds like the authors aren’t very good at healing this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How old were the males? Were they untrained? What experience did they have other than willing to volunteer? Why was it not relevant to include their mean age? Why can the results of using these males (who are undoubtedly over the age of 18) be generalized to adolescents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sacral slope merely indicates a back angle, and we can quite clearly assume it to change during a squat. A back squat will naturally have more of an incline than a front squat, so this “sacral slope” is completely irrelevant and tells us what we already know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the squat itself was not quantified whatsoever, any readings taken during the squat are completely irrelevant. There’s no way to know whether or not these researchers or subjects have any clue on how to do the squat. <strong>This is the biggest problems in most, if not all, squat studies: it’s never quantified. If you don’t quantify the movement, you cannot reproduce it in further studies or even know what standards the subjects were held to in the first place.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the sample size is too low to imply anything even if the researchers/subjects actually knew what they were doing to begin with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This study showed that the lordosis (or natural curvature of the lower back) decreased during the squats. This would appear to imply that the lordosis lessened, or in other words the subject slightly rounded his back. Everyone reading this site knows that lumbar flexion is not supposed to occur during a squat, and if that’s what this data means then the subjects are implementing it incorrectly. This, of course, would mean the whole study is erroneous and irrelevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The changes “would be expected” to increase “lumbar extension forces” and “play a role in pars fractures”. Of course the author of the news article (John Fauber) would turn this vernacular into “squats likely cause” fractures. If he had made any effort to analyze this from a scientific perspective, he’d see that this statement would absolutely not apply given the information presented. Furthermore, “expecting” something to happen isn’t science, it’s wishful thinking, so the fault lies with the researchers as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the researchers disagreed with the arguments thus far, then they should make their article freely available to the public instead of requiring payment and membership to read it. Doing so could validate their data, yet it would probably show how bad of a study this is. Regardless, this press release abstract shows how painfully erroneous all of these claims are. It not only makes them look like fools, but it makes John Fauber look like a complete dolt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This study ONLY displays information on changing of sacral slope during two movements that aren’t even quantified. No one else can replicate this study because of this lack of quantification. Additionally, it is pointing out what is already quite clear to anyone who has a mediocre grasp of musculoskeletal anatomy and strength training (meaning that we already know there is a change in back/sacral angle during squatting — this means that wasting time performing this study was a waste of time).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The study makes a grand leap of an assumption that squats are to blame for the adolescent injuries (a data point that isn’t quantified either). It assumes that squats cause the fracture instead of 100+ pound kids running into each other at full speed while in lumbar flexion or extension. It ignores the data that exists on incidence of injury in sport compared to weightlifting (weightlifting rate of injury is incredibly low when compared to very high rates of injury in other sports like soccer and football, see Starting Strength).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of all, it ignores the fact that an adolescent, especially when un-trained in barbell lifting, will not have good muscular or skeletal density around their spine and hips. Most kids don’t even know how to contract these muscles, much less hold them in place properly when applying or receiving force. These kids are then placed in inefficient positions — due to not having developed the musculature and skill to do so properly — and then making full contact with other kids or the ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bones and muscles will not increase their density or ability to withstand force without the application of stress. In order to make either stronger, they must be subjected to forces. There is no better way to strengthen these structures — both postural and force applyers — than a squat through a full range of motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High school football coaches are notorious for not teaching very good technique in lifting. For that matter, NSCA certified “professionals” aren’t that good either, and there are many examples of NCAA collegiate strength coaches who do a poor job of coaching correct lifting mechanics. This doesn’t mean that all high school or collegiate coaches are bad, but an overwhelming amount allow inefficient mechanics. This article assumes that there isn’t any fault in the coaches. Despite this lack of skill in coaching, the rate of injury is still low when compared to the rates of injury in sport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my 13 years of training with barbells, playing football in high school and briefly in college, and training and coaching for the majority of it, especially the last five years, I have never seen or heard of this injury.</p>
</li>
</ol>
