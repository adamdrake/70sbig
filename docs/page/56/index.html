  <p>Monday’s are dedicated to displaying or helping female lifters and trainees. Today’s feature is a couple more regular women who are pretty damn strong. Jen Higgins of <a href="http://www.crossfitworks.com" target="_blank">CrossFit Works</a> sent me the e-mail but was mostly talking about how great of a lifter Liz Cameron is.</p>
<p>This is Liz pulling 286.5 lbs (130kg) weighing 114 (52kg weight class).</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l7uXzWWpmKc" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>That’s pretty solid technique for a max rep, especially for a female (round backs are the norm). Jen told me how Liz is about half her age, but was a great training partner as they readied for the 100% RAW Single Lift Worlds in Las Vegas. Liz’s best competition bench is 150lbs and her best competition squat is 220 (weighing 110). Liz has won the Best Female Lifter in the two meets that she’s competed in! She also teaches salsa dancing and apparently is “frequently sighted in short dresses and high heels”. Jen conveniently didn’t send pics of this claim.</p>
<p>All of this is high praise from Jen Higgins as she is also pretty damn strong. Here’s a video of her pulling a really clean looking 292.1 lbs (132.5 kg) in the 123 lbs/56kg weight class.</p>

<p>Well done, ladies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a question that doesn’t really apply to the podcast though, but rather dead lifting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show the wall o’ text” hide=”Hide the wall o’ text”]A lot of what I’ve read seems to make the case for a relatively narrow stance for the conventional dead lift due to mechanical advantages and so on. Due to some mobility issues I began dead lifting with a narrower stance (roughly 6 inches in between feet) because it felt more comfortable to get down and also because my own research seemed to advocate for the narrower stance. Thanks to you, Justin, my mobility is greatly improving and I feel almost back to normal with my previous wider stance (feet approx. just outside shoulder width). I pulled an easy 445# yesterday with the wider stance and 480# is my current PR before the stance/mobility issues. I’m curious, since I seem to be going against what most consider an ideal stance, is this just a product of my specific body type leverages and I don’t need to worry, or is there something else going on that I’m doing wrong and I’m trying to counteract other inefficiencies. My short term goal is to get over 500# in the 181 class so I have a little ways to go but I want to make sure the basic efficacy of the lift is solid. The only other noteworthy aspect is that my weak point has always been off the floor, and the wider stance seems to help. Lockout has never seemed to be an issue. Thanks.[/spoiler]</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR — He wants to know how a narrow stance would be more beneficial in the deadlift.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear bohdi,</p>
<p>A narrow stance on the deadlift is more efficient and important, and is usually the one thing that most people can correct to improve their deadlift. The ideal stance is best summarized as “hip width”, which is quite obviously more narrow than “shoulder width” (a typical squat stance, which is also usually too wide in most people). This will be no more than ten inches for most people. I measured my stance, and it’s nine inches from heel to heel. Don’t worry about the specific measurement; just use a hip-width stance.</p>
<p>First, the narrow stance can improve the set up. If the stance is more narrow, then the knees can be shoved out more compared to a wider stance. Shoving the knees out more is external rotation, and that means there is more external rotation at the hip with the narrow stance when your knees are touching the arms. More external rotation will do two things: 1) it will contract the external rotators more and subsequently use them to maintain tightness around the hip and to apply force and 2) externally rotating will bring the femur away from the ASIS, or hip bone, so that there is no, or less, hip impingement. Less hip impingment will allow you to put the lumbar spine into extension more effectively. See Mark Rippetoe’s “Active Hip” article if you’re confused. This externally rotated position with a narrow stance utilizes the muscluature of the quadriceps and hamstrings much better than a wider stance, improving the overall efficiency of the lift.</p>
<p>Secondly, the narrow stance will allow for a more narrow grip. The grip should be close enough so that at lockout, the hands are on each side of the legs. A more narrow grip will shorten the distance that the bar has to be pulled. If you’re confused, then consider deadlifting with a snatch grip; the bar will have to travel a greater distance due to the wide grip. Having a narrow grip will shorten this distance, yet it will also allow the chest to be squeezed up more than if there was a wider grip. If you’re confused, observe back angle changes when placing your hands on the inside of the collar of the bar compared to putting your hands on the inside rings (where the knurling starts). The back angle will be more vertical, and thus more efficient, with the narrow grip.</p>
<p>These are two compelling points for using a hip-width stance on the deadlift, and these are two corrections I have to make in every workshop I’ve ever done. Along with these corrections, the lifter just needs to drag the bar up their legs and they will achieve a B grade deadlift. An A is awarded to sub-maximal lifts when the back is not unlocked and the hamstrings do their job of maintaining the angle off the floor and extending the hips for the lockout.</p>

<p><em>benzc asks:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the lats aid in internal rotation, would fucking sweet lats help make an overhead position in the snatch more stable? If not does lat strength have any real carry over into oly lifting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear benzc,</p>
<p>In a proper snatch rack, the shoulders will be externally rotated. This is the position that will be most efficient and safest at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. As we know from the <a href="/blog/2011/10/lats-while-benching/" target="_blank">bench discussion</a>, the lats will stretch when in external rotation.</p>
<p>Lat strength will certainly be one factor improving stability in the rack position of a snatch, but snatch technique will be largely more responsible. If the skill of a proper rack isn’t learned or the bar path throughout the entire lift is funky (i.e. looping around the head), then impressive lat strength won’t be enough to hold it in place. However, greater shoulder strength will be beneficial for hitting heavier snatches provided that the technique is there…but it usually isn’t. Having a good base of strength and musculature will be important when learning the movement and can help account for lack of technique by muscling the bar into position, yet good technique will reduce the need for severe over corrections.</p>

<p><em>The Wheel of Pain asks:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo Justin, what do you think of IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros (then eat it) as a nutrition approach. Basically, build your diet around whole foods blah blah blah, but if you want a bit of ice cream, a cheeseburger, or some tacos and beers with friends, enjoy–as long as you adjust your day’s (or week’s) total intake so that this stuff fits within your macro scheme. This way you’re not totally avoiding pleasurable foods like an orthorexic freakshow just because they’re not on an approved list of “pure” or “good” or “clean” foods.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I just heard this acronym today and realized it describes my nutrition approach pretty well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear The Wheel of Pain,</p>
<p>This method would imply that ice cream and snickers bars will be no different than a nutrient dense carb source like a sweet potato. This is sort of related to the Zone vs. Paleo thing that went down with CrossFit a couple of years ago. Eating shitty quality food in an optimal ratio will be better than just eating shitty amounts of copious food, but eating higher quality food will always be better than eating shitty of food. Besides, it’s not like people overeat and get fat or diabetes from blueberries and sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>I’m an advocate of the palelothic diet because it not only makes sense, but it is high in nutrients and low in foods that cause a lot of problems. I pretty much eat within the requirements of a “paleo diet”, yet don’t shy away from a good double bacon cheeseburger and like to have a little bit of wine and beer every week. I think that the paleo diet is the standard for food quality good outline to follow for longevity and health. Along with some other tweaks, it is also very good at reducing body fat and gaining muscle.</p>
<p>In other words, no, I don’t think that eating whatever you want within the boundaries of your macros is an optimal way to eat. Besides, macros are so individualized and training dependent that hardly any of us will know what is an optimal ratio anyway.</p>

<p><em>Josh Says:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a question about the Push Press. I saw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcr9KiBrEHg" target="_blank">this video</a> from CalStrength a while ago, showing Donnie Shankle PP’ing from his traps…so, like, a “behind-the-neck-push-press”. Is this the movement that Glenn is referencing when he talks about the Push Press? Is it a significantly different movement (wrt to strength development and carry over to other lifts)? I am as yet unable to rest the bar on my delts, so this is an attractive alternative to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Josh,</p>
<p>I will ask Glenn if that’s what he was referrig to. Behind-the-neck push-presses will yield heavier poundages since the force that the legs produce is transferred to the bar more efficiently than if it’s racked on the deltoids. It’s also easier to maintain a vertical torso with the bar on the back. In other words, you’ll be able to lift heavier weigth behind the neck than in front of it.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that Donnie has been lifting seriously for over a decade. He is as much of a professional as you will find in our country. I point this out because the behind-the-neck push-press isn’t something I would recommend that a beginner try out, especially because of the descent. If you are unable to rack the bar on your deltoids, you can try raising your elbows up and maybe taking a wider grip. It’s okay if your elbows are pointed completely forward in this movement as the drive from the hips will get the bar to at least eye level.</p>

<p><em>gumbo says:</em></p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Training question for Justin and the gang: what are some cues for squat depth? I want to do USAPL meets next year, so I’ve been obssessive about going deep. But – my coach said last night that I’ve been going too deep (“bottoming-out”) and losing hamstring tension in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How do y’all find that sweet spot that’s below parallel, but not ass-to-grass?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear gumbo,</p>
<p>You only need to go about an inch, maybe two, below “parallel” as this will be the optimal positioning to stretch your hamstrings. Any further and the knee angle gets too acute and it shortens the hamstrings, thus decreasing their tension. Your coach has a good eye.</p>
<p>The cue “cut it off” is simple, but then it helps to have the coach be there so that he can give immediate feedback on each rep in case they get too high. I often will make a noise indicating when the person should start the ascent, and if that doesn’t work I’ll use a tactile cue on their butt at proper depth. If that doesn’t work, I’d set them up in the position without a bar on their back to show them the correct depth. The whole process takes less than two minutes.</p>

  <p>November is a magical month. Men across the world will forgo the confusing art of shaving and develop impressive and intense facial hair. Some may call it “No Shave November”. We have called it Novemburly. Many know it as Movember. Either way, you’re participating.</p>
<p>Movember started in 1999 and has developed into a month-long fundraiser for men’s health, particularly cancer. Cancer is a pestilent adversary and 70’s Big is joining the fight to kick it in the BALLS. Combine fighting and facial hair, and we’re there. However, this time it’s to raise money.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can participate: either create a profile and join the 70’s Big Fundraising team on us.movember.com, or donate to the team or one of our members. Either way, <a href="http://us.movember.com/mospace/1715536/" target="_blank">click here</a> and get started (the team is on the right).</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Even if you only donate one doll-hair, that will help. Various team members will be doing amusing things for donations, so keep an eye out.</strong></p>

</div>

<p><strong>Contest Prizes</strong></p>
<p>Whoever raises the most money on the 70’s Big Movember Team will receive $50 bucks, a 70’s Big t-shirt, and their choice of one of my e-books or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063" target="_blank">FIT</a>. That’s right — raise the most money for a badass cause, grow some facial hair, AND get cash and 70’s Big gear. I’M GOING TO PAY YOU TO GROW FACIAL HAIR, SO GET STARTED.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to grow a mustache?</strong></p>
<p>Movember emphasizes shaving at the beginning of the month and growing a mustache. Since Jacob Cloud and I already have sweet facial hair, we’re certainly not going to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmFnarFSj_U" target="_blank">SHAVE</a> it. Instead, grow whatever you want. If you have a beard, show it off. If you don’t, then either grow a ‘stache or don’t shave all month. Pick one, join the fundraising team, and LET’S FUCKING KILL CANCER.</p>
<p>And now a word from co-captain Jacob Cloud and his cat Weezer:</p>

<p>We talk a little bit about FIT, but also talk about weightlifting in the Pan American Games last week and the upcoming weightlifting World Championships occurring next week in Paris. There’s some time spent on talking about Kendrick Farris, how he did at Pan Ams, his jerk, and when Hartman met him as a school age lifter. Then we get into various questions about weightlifting including hitting a solid rack position in the snatch, push-pressing, rack position in the push-press and jerk, and possibly doing an old-time weightlifting meet with the clean and press, snatch, and clean and jerk. This podcast flows very well and has a lot of good information in it.</p>

  <p>This post was written by my pal AJ. I got to hang out with him a bit at USAPL Raw Nationals in Scranton earlier this year. His biceps are pretty decent. On a similar note, he coaches strength training and powerlifting in south Florida. This post is about one of his female lifters, (who he refers to as) “Big Cat”, who came to him with some hyper mobility issues yet has progressed very well in her 10 months of lifting.</p>
<p><strong>Training the Big Cat</strong></p>
<p><em>by AJ Loreto, The Lion Tamer</em></p>
<p>The Big Cat came into Just Lift to ‘tighten up’. Not in <a href="http://youtu.be/cvP7cnmxlLM?t=55s" target="_blank">this kind</a> of way, but in the ‘my joints are fucked up from BJJ and need to stop being so mobile’ kind of way. I’ve never really heard of this, but whatever we’re <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Just-Lift/116645658515" target="_blank">Just Lift Powerlifting Team</a> so we’ll take in anyone who wants to be there. She wanted to lift, so I threw her at the weights and Starting Strength. By the way, I’m a “Starting Strength Coach”, the seminar was fucking great, and now I’m a good coach.</p>
<p>Big Cat already wanted to be in the gym, so there wasn’t much need for extra motivation. In her first round of programming she did the good old 3 sets of 5 reps, with little drama aside from some tricky shoulder joints requiring some extra warming up and an occasional rub to loosen up. She <a href="http://vimeo.com/24700100" target="_blank">high bar squatted</a> early on because of her shoulders and lack of traps and rear delts to hold the bar, but now she’s got a shelf that would make the <a href="/shrugthug" target="_blank">Shrug Thug</a> proud and no longer has issues holding the bar low.</p>
<p>We eventually got her to squat consistently without collapsing at the bottom. At first she would take some repetitions as “opportunities” to either go too deep or forget what she was doing and literally drop to the floor requiring some interesting spotting efforts and removing the bar from her back completely (we eventually got the hint and used side spotters). Her inability to recover from troublesome squat reps got better and now the Big Cat is capable of actually grinding reps out without going limp.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/30647387">Big Cat Deadlifts 135kg June 18th 2011 USAPL local meet</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user3820860">Tony</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Her lifts were pretty straight forward; a solid deadlift, a strong, fairly wide-stance squat and finally a decent bench and press (when there wasn’t much shoulder pain). The Big Cat picked up a bunch of strength in the first few weeks, making good consistent progress once she figured out how to balance. It became clear that her athletic background gave her a good foundation of strength.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, don’t ever turn your back on the Big Cat – you might be sitting on the bench talking about the fat pump you just caught doing rows for the bros and she’ll sneak up behind you and put you in a choke hold till you’re unconscious. The gym is a dangerous jungle.</p>
<p>After a few short months of training the Big Cat wanted to show off her strength and dominate other lesser domesticated animals. She had to work hard to make weight, and may have done so in a manner that wasn’t the safest; she may have fallen onto a hard object and showed up on meet day with bloody teeth (good intimidation for the other ladies lifting). This isn’t a meet recap so I’ll keep it quick: the ferocious Big Cat had a great first competition. Even with her coaches lack of attention she nailed a 242lb squat, 143lb bench and 297lb deadlift (above) weighing 132lbs. She had a bunch left in each lift, but we took it easy for her first comp. Did we mention she was the best female lifter? PRETTY FUCKING STRONG, eh?</p>
<p>Outside of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Just-Lift/116645658515" target="_blank">Just Lift</a>, Big Cat started noticing her legs where truly kicking ass. Sith her now more powerful legs she was taking chumps by surprise when getting hot and dirty in BJJ.</p>
<p>_AJ points out a few things regarding women training. I’ll summarize them in a list:</p>
<p>– Addressing hyper mobility with strength training (learning proper end ROM)</p>
<p>– Big Cat didn’t need motivation</p>
<p>– Used high bar until shoulders and musculature allowed for low bar position</p>
<p>– The squat and muscle control evolved from “loose” and “collapsing at the bottom” to tight and controlled</p>
<p>– New types of balance and control were learned (in addition to the non-barbell balance developed in BJJ)</p>
<p>– This newfound strength and stability helped augment another sport_</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Justin, quick TM question, do you have experience with someone doing back to back bench or press weeks (i.e. not alternating) for a few weeks while chasing a milestone PR? Is this alright, or not advisable due to recovery concerns? Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear theturgid,</p>
<p>I always knew the term “turgid” had a negative connotation, but I didn’t realize it meant “swollen and distended or congested”. Sounds like what happens when you drink milk. Concerning the question, I’ve had lifters bench in consecutive weeks when getting ready for powerlifting meets. “Chasing a PR” would be a similar thing without the meet, so yes, that’s okay. I would still have you press on that Light Day — whenever I have strong guys decrease pressing frequency as they ready for a meet, their shoulders get sore (more on this in the Texas Method Part 2 e-book coming in a week or so).</p>

<p><em>Evan asks</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I grip my strict press in similar fashion to you. When it comes to push pressing, do you grip and rack the bar exact same as a jerk? Delts out for a shelf, etc? With the strict press, shoulders should be tight along with the upper back, similar to benching.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I always get in a rut when I try and push press, because I want to rack the bar like a strict press, and it’s unstable on the upper pecs/sternum without the delts for a shelf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Evan,</p>
<p>I’m glad you grip the press the way I do since it’s the only way to do it with optimal mechanical efficiency. As for the push press, Dr. Hartman and I discuss this very topic in the podcast we recorded yesterday (it will be out next week some time). Depending on anthropometry, the grip will be somewhere between the press and jerk grip. I widen my grip by a finger width or two so that I can have the bar sitting on my deltoids. It’s imperative the bar rests on the deltoids in the push press so that the trunk delivers the force of the dip/drive instead of it transmitting through the shoulders, down the arms, through the elbows and wrists, and into the bar. The chest will be up, but tightness won’t be as intense as the bench press (since during the bench the shoulder blades are pinched extremely hard with hardcore thoracic extension). Adjust your grip so you can rest the bar on your delts and dip/drive vertically.</p>

<p><em>A hypothetical weightlifting fan asks,</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, what happened in weightlifting in the Pan American Games yesterday? Was their a link? I couldn’t find a link anywhere!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear hypothetical weightlifting fan,</p>
<p>I posted the link at least 38 times, so bite me. As for yesterday, Donnie Shankle took bronze in the 105kg class (it was an interesting battle with the Cuban lifter, especially cause Pendlay was in our chat room talking about it as it was happening). For the super heavy females, Amaechi bombed out (it was her first international meet) and Robles was second in snatch at the break, trailing by 1kg. Then Robles clarked the fucking clean three times in a row at 135kg. I don’t have any sympathy for her, but I still support her going forward as an American because I’m not a turncoat piece of shit who low brows Americans for not being good at weightlifting.</p>
<p>Lastly Mendes had his first international meet and didn’t do fantastic, considering the overall standings. He snatched 175, which put him at second with body weight. The leader (a Brazilian lifter who apparently lifts in the U.S.?) snatched 185 (which is the same weight the 105kg Ecuadorian lifter did who won a gold medal, except he made it look like chump change) and clean and jerked 225. Mendes only hit 205kg on the clean and jerk. I think the biggest reason is because he was power jerking (which helped him go 1/3 on CJ) — he apparently does this due to injury. We all hope to see Mendes hitting some bigger numbers and staying healthy.</p>

<p>I’m looking at a pair of VS lifting shoes online, anybody know if the sizing is accurate? Should they fit snug or normal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Saul,</p>
<p>In my experience, VS Athletics shoes don’t fit like normal sneakers, although I would say it depends on the person. I wear 11 or 11.5 in normal shoes, and when I got 11.5 originally, I had to wear two socks to ensure my back foot did not slip when I was doing jerks. When I got my second pair, I got 11s, but they too seemed to have stretched as time has gone by (and I still wear two pair of socks when I jerk). My suggestion would be a half size down as having lifting shoes that are too big is a huge pain in the ass, especially when doing the Oly lifts.</p>

<p>Hey Justin!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I am about 4 weeks into my Linear Progression strength program and I have definitely made some gains since my first cycle this summer. My 1RM Back squat is upto 205#, my deadlift is upto 210# (not what it used to be but happy with that number since I had not been able to deadlift more than 135 since my back injury in January) my clean is 120# and I am doing 3×5 RDLs at 100#. The only lift that has not improved is the strict press. I am stuck at 80# and I have not made much improvements in any other overhead lift (push press, jerk). My push press is at 105# and my jerk is at 115# (body weight). How do i improve this or is simply about patience? I read your post about pressing and I have been trying to be conscious of it when I lift but of course its difficult to critique yourself</p>

<p>Dear Sandi,</p>
<p>I’ve already replied to you on FB, but I thought this would make a good addition to the Q&amp;A. One thing I didn’t address in the message is that if you aren’t bench pressing, your press will not progress as well as it could. The bench press is one of the major upper body strengtheners; the bench and the press augment each other. I’m not sure if your gym has the equipment to bench, but if it does, utilize this movement.</p>
<p>Remember to micro load your movements as you progress them. For many reasons, women won’t progress very easily on these exercises and their weight increases will need to be small. If you don’t have one pound plates, you should find them at a sport store (1 pound baseball bat weights work well and are cheap).</p>
<p>Another option is to press on Monday and push-press on Friday. This would allow you to handle heavier weight on Friday while getting a normal press session on Monday; girls especially benefit from handling some heavier weights in training as it seems to promote an adaptation in their neuromuscular efficiency. You could even handle heavier weight on Monday by doing singles on the minute to accumulate some volume. 10 singles on the minute with a heavier weight on Monday and push-press doubles (three to five sets) on Friday would get you using a higher intensity. After four to six weeks, you can switch the press workout to 3×3 or 3×5 (and keep the push pressing on Friday) and you will probably be able to use more than where you are at now.</p>

<p>Dear Tobi,</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but notice your lack of curls in this program. You must have biceps like me. But let’s get serious. I don’t think this is a bad program, but I don’t think it will be conducive to progress. When I did my linear progression (starting in January of 2009), I power snatched Monday, deadlifted Monday, and power cleaned on Friday. The fact that I didn’t have any friends at the time and was doing the power cleans late on Friday nights <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/original/000/003/619/Untitled-1.jpg?1288903617" target="_blank">alone</a> is immaterial. It didn’t take long to drive my dick in the ground since I was pulling in all of my training sessions (I was also not adapted to pulling a lot).</p>
<p>Methinks you have good intentions, yet your dick will be underground doing your program. Maybe not next week, but eventually. This is all dependent on your rep schemes and weights, but you can still make progress on the power clean by training it once a week. You could always do it lighter on the Friday workout to drill technique or speed. You could also consider removing the deadlift for a time in the program (4 weeks, for example) if you specifically want to push the power clean. If you did that, I’d put RDLs in your program once or twice a week. RDLs are fantastic and can maintain deadlifting strength and improve the very important hamstring strength and musculature.</p>
<p>All right guys, it’s been fun, but I’ll talk to you here in a little bit.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Pan_American_Games" target="_blank">2011 Pan American Games</a> are in full swing and 70’s Big has been covering some of the weightlifting sessions on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a>. There’s usually some decent stuff going on at the fan page, but this is an instance where we were essentially posting results of the sessions as they were happening. If you can’t see Facebook, then you can always follow on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a> too.</p>
<p>I didn’t know the exact times of the lifting because the Pan Am website makes it difficult to navigate to the next day’s scheduling. In any case, today is the last day of lifting, and the schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>– 1:00 PM – Men’s 105kg (featuring American Donnie Shankle)</p>
<p>– 3:00 PM – Women’s 75+ (featuring Americans Sarah Robles and Chioma Amaechi)</p>
<p>– 5:00 PM – Men’s 105+ (featuring American Pat Mendes)</p>
<p>Guadalajara is in the Central time zone, yet I think the’s times are in Eastern time. Be on the lookout for the sessions (if anyone can confirm the time zone, then let me know).</p>
<p>Two time Olympian Chad Vaughn finished with a 326kg total to take bronze in the 77kg class.</p>
<p><a href="http://deportesus.terra.com/road-to-2012/videos/0,,342482.html" target="_blank">Video of his heaviest successful lifts</a></p>
<p>Yesterday Kendrick Farris had a decent day taking bronze in the 85kg category. There was some kind of issue either with the display of the meet clock on the back, or his coaches not keeping an eye on it. In any case, he had to run out for his third attempt snatch. Kendrick came out and missed the jerk on his opener at 190kg, then hit 191kg on the second attempt. It looks like he’s back to doing his hybrid split/squat hybrid jerk instead of the squat jerk. He came out for the third attempt when his name was on the monitor, and we saw the judge tell him the bar wasn’t ready and to go back in the warm-up room. It’s possible that another lifter’s coaches changed their weight at the last second to dick Kendrick over, but either way his coaching team should have had better situation awareness. There was less than ten seconds when he ran from the curtain and he ended up getting his hands on the bar with one second left, and only clean pulled a deadlift. Despite these goofs, he still made bronze.</p>

<p>Jon North and Jared Fleming competed in the 94kg class. They both missed their third snatch with both hitting 155 on the second attempt. Jon hit his opener at 178kg and Jared missed his opening clean on 180k. Jared attempted 180 again, had a better front squat, then the jerk drove him down, and he had to stabilize it for about five seconds for a good lift. Jon then flexed for the camera and shouted “Shankle” before his second attempt at 183. It was a hard front squat, and then I wrote this:</p>
<p>Hit jerk, hopped around like a frog. Then tried to shake the judges hand and was denied????</p>
<p>They both attempted 190 on their third attempt. I noted that Jared had a great clean and front squat, but the jerk was just too heavy today. Jon went after Jared and was talking to himself, saying “Klokov”, “Steiner”, and “Ali”. I wrote “real hard clean” and “jerk too heavy today”. Jon finished in 4th place overall and Jared in 5th place overall.</p>
<p><a href="http://deportesus.terra.com/road-to-2012/videos/0,,343002.html" target="_blank">Here’s a video of 94kg lifters</a></p>
<p>70’s Big will be posting updates on the Facebook Fan Page and Twitter for today’s sessions and I’ll post a link in those two places for a live IRC chat as well.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you are someone who thinks that the sport of weightlifting needs to grow — or that you have BITCHED about it’s lack of growth or talked shit about the USAW, then this is the time to support it. I’ve already seen people bad mouth our lifters on my own Facebook page as if not competing well internationally is a reason to not support our lifters. I suppose these same people supported the fucking Taliban too. Nevertheless, share and watch the live feed, spread the pictures I’m posting on the Fan Page, share the results, and spread it around. If you have ever bitched about the sport’s lack of participation, then do something about it when events like this happen. Otherwise you’re a hypocrite and a pussy. Every CrossFitter should have at least a vague interest in this sport, and there’s no reason not to have a nice following for our lifters today. Good luck to them — let’s get some more medals.</p>

<p>Sweet potatoes cost as low as $.60/lb, and they have a little bit of sweet flavor. However, baked sweet potatoes get boring, so let’s get reckless. Here’s what you’re gonna need:</p>
<p>– 1 medium sized sweet potato (rhinoceros penis sizes are not necessary)</p>
<p>– 2 pieces of thick bacon</p>
<p>– 1 tbspon of butter</p>
<p>– cinnamon</p>
<p>– 1 handlebar mustache</p>
<p>Prep time is a couple of minutes. Cook time is a few minutes.</p>
<p>Cook the sweet potato. I prefer to use the microwave. Poke holes in the potato and cook it for four minutes. Two potatoes will cook in six minutes. While that’s cooking, fry the two pieces of bacon that you have already cut up into small pieces.</p>
<p>Once the sweet potato is done, cut it into small pieces. When the bacon is adequately cooked, but not burned or crispy, dump the sweet potatoes in and sauté the mixture.</p>
<p>Now plop a nice hunk of butter in. At least one tablespoon of butter. As it melts, give the whole mixture a good dusting of cinnamon. Then stir the mixture in with the melting butter thoroughly — this is where the magic happens.</p>
<p>Cooking things in butter makes them incredible, and sweet potato hash is no different. The butter allows the mixture to brown and infuses the cinnamon. This, of course, is just a garnish to whatever other egg/bacon meal you’re already having. I suggest fried eggs mixed into the sweet potato hash or scrambled eggs and bacon on the side. Enjoy.</p>

  <p>People scour the internet searching for the majestic Press Booster that miraculously improves pressing ability. Unfortunately the Press Booster is merely a tall tale created by real life creatures known as “fuckers” in order to buffalo you. What fuckers don’t realize is that first comes mechanics, then comes consistency, and then comes belligerency in a baby carriage.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanics</strong></p>
<p>Too often I see pressing grips that are very wide — the forearms should be vertical in the starting or rack position, and they should also be vertical from the front and side view. The wrist should be in a close-compacted position that puts the bar in the heel of the palm. The bar should remain close to the face during the ascent and descent while the lifter gets their torso under the bar. Speaking of the torso, it shouldn’t bend much and the thoracic/lumbar junction should never be in hyper extension. The hips should also not be in anterior rotation at lockout. Lastly, assuming all of this other stuff is occurring correctly, the shoulders shouldn’t be internally rotating. Pretty simple, huh?</p>
<p>I’ll be very clear in admitting that this post cannot address the questions that the last paragraph presents because I could write a long post on each item. The point is that there is a lot going on and until the mechanics are addressed, the program itself is not to blame.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
<p>Pressing will increase with diligency (not a word). Constantly chipping away at it over time will develop a good press. I have been pressing for at least once a week since July of 2010 and have averaged at least once a week since January of 2009 (the only reason I didn’t initially use Jan of 2009 is because when I was on the Texas Method I alternated bench/press weeks). The press benefits from an accumulated work load. Most linear progressions nowadays utilize a good amount of pressing, yet eventually there is a limit on how far three sets of five (3×5) can be progressed. There’s no point in beating a dead horse, so using some different rep ranges will help increase pressing strength. The first thing to play around with in programming is to use some heavier weight, but not to abandon old rep schemes. One example is that I have developed an ascending 3×3 and 3×5 rep scheme that alternates every week on the press and bench with <a href="http://www.crossfitironhorse.com/2011/07/great_success.png" target="_blank">great success</a>. The key is not to use anything fancy but to keep utilizing the press.</p>
<p><strong>Belligerency</strong></p>
<p>Once some basic programmatic variables have been played with, you’ll have to take chances on your pressing days. You’ll have to try and push your last triple, last set of five, or your 3×5 sets across. You’ll have to learn how to grind through tough presses, and you do this by getting experience with hard reps. You will not press heavy weights if you push the bar forward so learn how to keep it close and get under it. Once you can grind though a ten second press, you will know how to fight through the hard reps.</p>
<p>Using other exercises to build the press isn’t necessary until mechanics, consistency, and belligerency are addressed. Then there are a few options for the seasoned presser. But whatever, this was all just an excuse to post my recent PR (this one is not in a speedo like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqsiykYN720" target="_blank">last time</a>).</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MS3Itmh34Fo" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>You can see that I have a bit of stretch reflex to aid the start of the rep. In training, I don’t mind this assuming the fundamental mechanics are in place (referenced above). You’ll see that my torso, hips, and knees maintain rigidity, which are my requirements for a proper press. However, I would not allow this stretch reflex in competition as it is difficult to quantify and subsequently difficult to judge. I don’t have a problem in doing it, and I prefer to do it for the sake of handling more weight and reps (as long as it’s not excessive, and it’s not in either video).</p>
