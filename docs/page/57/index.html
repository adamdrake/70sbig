  <p>This week I want to motivate you women who actually do train, whether you’re already strong or not. You may be the queen in your gym, but somewhere out there a stronger woman is training her heart out. It just so happens that there is a gym full of these gals at <a href="http://www.crossfitretribution.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Retribution</a> in Westminster, MD. This facility is run by Beau Bryant (not to be confused with <a href="http://www3.images.coolspotters.com/photos/83115/bear-bryant-profile.jpg" target="_blank">this guy</a>) and he has developed a stable of good lifters and is even using The Texas Method (he bought <a href="/ebook/" target="_blank">the e-book</a> a while back).</p>
<p>This is Beau’s wife Angie hitting a fucking solid set of 225×3 on squat. I’m impressed, because this is a beautiful low bar back squat and she crushes the first rep. The neat part about it is that Beau sent me a video of her after last week’s Intensity Day and she missed the third rep at 220.</p>

</div>

<p>I just watched it again — god damn it what a great set. She doesn’t have any chest dropping due to thoracic weakness or hamstring weakness. Just real fucking solid. Well done Beau and Angie, well done. Oh, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj_5IqZWxR0" target="_blank">here</a> is their new shirt.</p>
<p>I could end the post and be very happy, but THERE’S MOAR.</p>
<p>Here is Tiff — she had no barbell training experience prior to joining the gym. Here she is pulling 290×5 like she’s drying her hair.</p>

</div>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idVItht6afQ&#038;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here’s a vid</a> of her squatting 275×3.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have the 110 pound mother of two, Leah squatting 160×1 a couple months ago. The record in her weight class is 170, so they are trying to break that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why should i take fish oil? and why the fuck am i eating like mad, training my ass off and still keep being skinny fat? is there a 70s big gen missing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Mooy,</p>
<p>Fish oil is a natural anti-inflammatory and contains EPA and DHA. For our purposes, it probably helps with systemic recovery and some people point out that it improves joint pain. It is also said to help with insulin sensitivity, but I admit I haven’t read about this in a while. I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_oil" target="_blank">Wiki page</a> did a good overview.</p>
<p>As for you “eating like mad” and still being skinny fat, I really can’t say. Eating copious amounts of food is not always the answer to improve muscularity, and it’s also very dependent on your program. Are you training your body as a system every day? This would include large lifts like the squat or deadlift in addition to other things like pressing, benching, RDLing, and rowing. Maybe you aren’t doing enough barbell curls, or maybe the right drugs are what is missing. I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy. You can find him in a back alley and he’s got some cheese burgers, man.</p>
<p>If you’re genetically predisposed to skinniness, or have only recently taken up training, then it will take diligent and chronic work over time to develop strength and muscularity. Reevaluate your program and don’t lose hope on the quest of 70’s Big.</p>

<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>I was worried you wouldn’t tell me <em>where</em> it hurt, but you did towards the end of the video. You also haven’t told me if it developed into the pain or if it is a result of an acute injury. My primary suggestion is that you get it looked at by someone with letters next to their name (so that I cover my ass). In the mean time, avoid benching. I suggest some basic massage on the area (a lacrosse ball will work), then take it through a full range of motion (arm circles, pressing movement), then ice it. Ice it liberally (standard procedure, no longer than 20 minutes, but multiple times a night if possible), continue working on it. As it improves, work on mobility for your internal rotators. This is very hard to help with since I’m not discussing it with you and not there in person.</p>
<p>You either have built up scar tissue or have inflamed the area. The video was posted three days ago, so any acute phase should be done and you should be able to treat it or take it through a full ROM. If you decide to press, start light, and rehab pain is okay, but sharp pain is not. Use lighter weight with reps to get blood flow to the area, and whenever you do anything to it (mobility, massage, movement), ice it. I’m sure we’ll talk about it more soon.</p>

<p>Please help me to avoid murdering my husband. I got three press PR attempts stuck at forehead level today. I need to fix that or I am going to beat him with a barbell the next time he asks me how it is possible to get a press rep stuck so high.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Tamara,</p>
<p>I do not support marital murder. Just wanted to clear that up. Whenever I observe people pressing, I don’t really ever see technically sound pressing. The only people that I know of with great mechanics on the press are AC and me. Mike is probably good (although I haven’t seen him press a lot lately), yet Chris doesn’t have good wrist position.</p>
<p>Common problems are a) too wide a grip, b) elbows not vertical, c) improper wrist position, d) over extension in the thoracic-lumbar junction, and e) internal rotation at the shoulder (flaring the elbows). Readers: do not fret about all of those at once. Start with the first one and fix it, make it routine, then move to the next issue.</p>
<p>Assuming Tamara is doing all of these very well (which I wouldn’t think is the case since it usually isn’t for most people), then it would pertain to the programming. I don’t know what her program is or how the press is a part of it. I will point out that push-press may be something to consider given that her focus is on weightlifting. However, the press benefits most when it is done consistently with good mechanics. If good mechanics are used, then the triceps get a fantastic workout that can contribute to the bench press or other overhead movements. I would have people press at least once a week and consider varying the set/rep schemes to handle heavier weights (e.g. using ascending sets). Unfortunately a detailed programming and mechanics discussion leaves the scope of this post.</p>

<p>I ask Dr. Hartman via e-mail:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s your take on a multi? Just get a generic one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He replies:</p>
<p>Not really a difference maker. If anything, stay away from the hard pressed Centrum types as they don’t really do much and may or not breakdown effectively in your stomach. We did an experiment in undergrad where we put a Centrum vitamin in a solution similar to our stomach (~pH around 3.0 I believe) and watched it barely dissolve over the course of a day. Stick with the Emergen C from your video or buy a decent liquid multi…but I think you’re fine without one. (<em>end Hartman e-mail</em>)</p>
<p>I have since just gotten a cheap multi to take mid-day since I use Emergen-C in the morning. Dr. Hartman and I both expressed interest in the Greens+ anti-oxidant supplement. I am also going to experiment with BCAAs.</p>

<p>First and foremost I would like to thank you for the great information you post daily on 70big. I understand if you are too busy to either answer my question or think that it is a stupid question. If either are the case I understand. I am currently having some trouble deciding whether or not I am falling into the overreaching stage in my training. To give you some insight, I tore my lateral meniscus back in March while squatting. A few months after surgery I decided to give SS a shot to get the novice effect. I progressed well but only after a month of training I started to get severe pain in the back of my knee. I was scared of re injuring the knee so I changed the program that I stayed on for another month. I then purchased your book FIT and have been doing that ever since. I changed programs becuase I needed something that was more tailored to my goals which is your S&amp;C Program. As of right now I’m in training to become an electrical lineman. Everyday we go on a 2 mile hike or walk(depends), then 2 days out of the week we climb poles all day. After that I come home and do the S&amp;C Program as written. I’m not sure if this is too much stress on my body. In two weeks we will be climbing 5 days a week on top of our walks. I’m to the point where I missed my Press day by seven reps, when the last week I hit all 15. I was also recently sick so I’m not sure if that had anything to do with my performance. I don’t know whether too deload by dropping volume or intensity, not training at all, or doing body weight for a few weeks.I have been having some nagging pains in my elbow and upper shoulder which are due to climbing, along with my lower back feeling as though it is going to go out.Everything seems to feel heavy, even though they should be easy numbers to hit for me. I want to be fresh in order to complete my climbing cert and I want to keep increasing my numbers to achieve the advanced standards for a 198 pounder in your book. I am extremely motivated in getting my strength back and achieving my goals, which makes it hard to slow down and take a step back to take two steps forward. I sleep around 7-8 hours every night and have a fairly clean diet. All lean meats, veggies, and good fats with some dairy. Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again for everything you do.If you think I am just being a pussy and should push through it please let me know.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear Julian,</p>
<p>You’re not a pussy. You are stronger than the average guy, and will adapt to this new job in time. It’s okay to reduce your training volume while you are experiencing higher amounts of physical activity at work. Do this ESPECIALLY with the areas that are sore and nagging you. Over the next month, I don’t care what weight you lift, so long as you just take the muscles through a full ROM with the major lifts after work. Again, do not push the weight. This will a) allow you to have more energy for work, b) still get muscular work after work, and c) help you get adapted to the overall work load. By the way, you should be eating AT LEAST 250g of <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">protein</a> and drinking PLENTY of <a href="/blog/2011/09/water-and-protein/" target="_blank">water</a> given all of this activity.</p>
<p>Lastly, you need to do mobility work every day. Look <a href="http://www.google.com/search?gcx=w&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=mobility+site%3A70sbig.com" target="_blank">here</a> for some basic stuff, but check out <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/" target="_blank">MobilityWOD.com</a>. Work on the joints and muscles that attach to the joints or around them. I’m serious — do this every day. That will help you more than the lifting in the next couple weeks. Good luck.</p>
<p>Lastly, here is a video showing the types of notes I take for Programming Consultations. If you’re interested in a consultation, then shoot me an <a href="mailto:70sbigconsult@gmail.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a>.</p>

<p>Some topics from the Q&amp;A include:</p>
<p><strong>Push-press utility</strong></p>
<p>The question was specific to the carryover to the jerk (it helps for beginners), but Glenn touted this exercise as one of the best upper body exercises for a weightlifter saying (paraphrase), “If you’re strong in the push-press, you’re strong in everything else: press, bench, jerk, etc.”</p>
<p>This topic also led to a general discussion with strength and weightlifting and what kind of emphasis or frequency strength training would have in a weightlifting program as a trainee advances from beginner and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Pulling from blocks</strong></p>
<p>The question was specific to when to do them in the program. Glenn addresses the utility in pulling from blocks and when they would be pertinent to a program. There are even times when a beginner would use them as well, but only in a specific situation.</p>
<p><strong>Being an Olympic weightlifter without a coach</strong></p>
<p>The question was specifically asking what would be good resources to use in order to learn or improve the lifts, and Glenn ticks off a few good products and videos. He also gives some advice about submitting videos to forumz on the interwebz for critiquez.</p>
<p><strong>Conditioning in a strength or weightlifting program</strong></p>
<p>General trainees or beginning weightlifters will benefit from conditioning work. Glenn is an advocate for a very simple method of conditioning that is touted by other popular coaches. He also discusses the utility in complexes for ancillary work at the end of a training session. The complexes or circuits aren’t specifically designed for a conditioning effect, but they let the trainee get some accumulated work with assistance exercises to improve their hips, posterior chain, abdominals, lumbars, shoulders, etc. It’s quick and easy, but I want to add here that assuming no other conditioning work in the program that this would act as conditioning since the relative intensity and pace are higher than a standard strength program. At the minimum, a lifter could create a short complex/circuit like Glenn describes to get a slight endurance effect — something that can help their “between set recovery” as well.</p>

  <p>You know what? You guys don’t know shit. You don’t know what a hard day’s work is. You don’t know what it’s like to bleed and sweat. You don’t know how to dig DEEP, real DEEP, and get that last big of your SOUL and have it consume your nether region. You don’t know how to get a TASTE of the HARD work that is associated with being a champion. You don’t understand that to BE THE MAN, you have to BEAT THE MAN. This video teaches you a thing or two about training with a champion’s intensity. Take notes, you pile of shit.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.muscledriverusa.com" target="_blank">Muscle Driver</a> is hosting a series dubbed as <a href="http://www.muscledriverusa.com/MDUSA-Grand-Prix-Series_c_646.html" target="_blank">The Muscle Driver Grand Prix Series</a>. In a time where people complain about USAW and how the sport of Olympic weightlifting needs to grow, MD is making an effort to generalize Olympic weightlifting, make it accessible, and most importantly, make it fun.</p>
<p>Specifically this means MD is hosting meets around the country and awarding cash prizes for the top Sinclair formula finishers. The <a href="http://www.muscledriverusa.com/MDUSA-2011-Inaugural-Grand-Prix-Meet-Registration--11511_p_2361.html" target="_blank">inaugural meet</a> is on November 5th in Charllotte, NC.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/10/grandprix-revised.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5602" data-permalink="/blog/2011/10/md-grand-prix/grandprix-revised/" data-orig-file="/2011/10/grandprix-revised.jpg" data-orig-size="350,214" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="grandprix-revised" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/10/grandprix-revised.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/10/grandprix-revised.jpg" src="/2011/10/grandprix-revised.jpg" alt="" title="grandprix-revised" width="350" height="214" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5602" /></a></p>
<p>So many people have given their two cents on how to build the sport of weightlifting, and this is the first major non-USAW event to do so. Next year MD wants to give away at least $50,000 in prize money! There are even negotiations to get the final event televised on ESPN. This would be a huge boost for the sport as it hasn’t a) been popularized in culture and b) hasn’t ever compensated athletes monetarily.</p>
<p>The whole series is extremely accessible, but especially this first meet; anyone at any age can enter. More so, many top tier American lifters won’t be competing at this event because they are prepping for the American Open or the Olympic trials early next year. This means that <strong>anyone can walk away with prize money, ranging from $400 to $2,000</strong>. This opens the door for new or inexperienced lifters to end up on the podium and awarded some cash. I can’t say this definitively, but there aren’t many Americans (if any) that can say they won some dough by doing well at a weightlifting meet.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some resonating skepticism on the internet about the meet being “too big for my first meet” or “too big of an event, I’m not good enough yet”. This is the same weak behavior that everyone shows when faced with the “daunting task” of actually competing. Look: my first meet was in a barn in Texas and was basically a structured practice session. I had a great time, but it would have been a lot of fun to go to a very nice venue with top of the line equipment in the warm-up room. Not to mention some of the top coaches in the US will be there to specifically help beginners. This is the perfect opportunity to receive help from experienced coaches. When I went to Nationals in 2010, Paul Doherty lent a helping hand despite the fact that I was competing with one of his lifters (Ben Claridad). There will be more of the same at this MD meet.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have it on good authority that Glenn Pendlay will be racing Brad Hess in a C2 rowing competition. I’m almost positive he’ll puke.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></p>
<p>If you’re on the fence about doing your first meet, commit to this MD Inaugural meet and you’ll have a great time. It’s a nice venue with nice equipment and nice people. You’ll walk away a better lifter for sure.</p>

  <h2 id="egad-internal-rotation">Egad! Internal Rotation!</h2>
<p>It’s pretty common to see girls internally rotate on the press and bench press (guys do this too, and I say this because I’m ALL about equal opportunity and shit…) regardless if they are new to lifting or are experienced (I’m irritated I even have to clarify this). It could be due to a lack of a proper motor pathway, the coach’s fault for not addressing it, or a lack of musculature, specifically in the triceps. In any case this issue should be addressed soon. Some resources to elaborate on this topic include <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRCI3By2WUA" target="_blank">a video</a> on internal rotation and improving the push-up and <a href="/blog/2011/10/lats-while-benching/" target="_blank">an article</a> on how the internal rotators contribute to the bench press.</p>
<p>There are two ways to address this internal rotation problem: cuing it properly while doing the exercises and develop the musculature over time so that it can be done correctly. If we are going to cue the lifts, we have to assume that proper mechanics and set up exist; the most important is a correct grip where the forearms are vertical at the bottom ROM of the lift (start of press, bottom of bench).</p>
<p><strong>Pressing</strong></p>
<p>It’s been my experience that girls are fully aware of the location of their breasts even when not knowing what their body is doing during lifting. A simple “elbows to boobs” cue can help align their elbows and subsequently humerus (upper arm bone) into a properly externally rotated position. This cue works the best, but “elbows to ribs” could also be used — perhaps for the less endowed girls (I kid; they still know where their boobs are, they are just harder to find). Muscular guys can sometimes use “triceps to lats” for the same effect. If the concept has been taught and fully understood, “elbows in” could be used and is particularly helpful if the lifter is internally rotating in the middle of the lift (flaring the elbows on the way up).</p>
<p><a href="/2011/10/Forever_Stallone.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5592" data-permalink="/blog/2011/10/getting-girls-to-train-6/forever_stallone/" data-orig-file="/2011/10/Forever_Stallone.jpg" data-orig-size="188,241" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Forever_Stallone" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/10/Forever_Stallone.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/10/Forever_Stallone.jpg" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5592" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px; border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Forever_Stallone" src="/2011/10/Forever_Stallone.jpg" alt="" width="132" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>If the lifter internally rotates in the middle of the lift, then they are either not performing the cue properly (in which case good coaching needs to occur) or they are using too much weight to do it properly. It’s likely that properly external rotated positions will not allow the same weights to be pressed because the lifter has adapted to the wrong way. If you’re lifting by yourself and know that you are internally rotating (either by feeling it or from video), then drop the weight and do it correctly over time. It’s not like you are trying to impress anyone since you’re forever alone anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Bench Press</strong></p>
<p>Internally rotating on the bench press is more notable since the elbows can flare to perpendicular relative to the torso. There are many ways to correct this, including aiming for a 45 degree angle with the elbows, “elbows to ribs”, “elbows to lats”, “spread the bar apart”, or “elbows in”. The primary issue with improving internal rotation in either lift is that it has to occur consistently over time so that the structures develop in a way that executes the new externally rotated position properly.</p>
<p><strong>Developing the Structures</strong></p>
<p>Most guys, especially those that have been lifting for at least a year, can make the adjustment and improve their positioning by cuing it correctly, lowering the weight, and doing it consistently. Someone in this scenario may need to improve the frequency or volume of that lift in their program to garner enough reps to make a muscular change. Girls, on the other hand, will benefit from ancillary exercises. I’ve used the seated assisted dip machine to help develop the triceps of a girl to augment proper press and bench positioning. These work really well because during a dip the elbows (are supposed to) stay close to the ribs and develop the middle of the triceps — the part that primarily helps the press and bench. I’ve also put an emphasis on exercises like pull-ups, chin-ups, barbell rows, and dumbbell rows to develop the upper back to help positioning and to strengthen the area around the shoulder girdle. Keep in mind that isolation exercises will hardly be relevant for developing musculature to augment the primary lifts and instead you should use compound exercises (i.e. dips instead of triceps extensions).</p>
<p>Start paying attention to your internal rotation whether you’re a dude or a chick. If you’re doing it wrong, try out one of these cues and focus on it for a few weeks. It may require a reduction in weight, but it will pay dividends for your strength, joint health, and musculature in the long run.</p>

<p>Justin, how do you deal with persistent stalling/failing on TM? (All lifts, but mostly squat) The ebook mentions manipulating VD but that isn’t working for me. The options I see are:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear theturgid,</p>
<p>Typically I see numbers higher than yours in a TM set up, but it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. You are 6’2″ and weigh about 210 lbs (he said this in another comment), which isn’t that large for the height. You also said you don’t think your diet is the issue or what your goals are, but I have to assume you aren’t eating enough properly. Are you eating a MINIMUM of 250g of <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">high quality protein</a>? I like the 77 pound discrepancy between the VD and ID (although your VD rep scheme wasn’t specified), but you may require an increase in volume, especially since 264 is not a significant amount of stress for a 210 lb guy.</p>
<p>Under the assumption that you are doing everything in training, life, and recovery correctly (which is highly unlikely for most readers of this site), there are some more advanced techniques that will be out very soon in Part II of the Texas Method E-book. Sorry for the cliff hanger, but reevaluate the ancillary stuff and increase your volume slightly and see what happens.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dear beloved Jake,</p>
<p>I’m not very well read on the metabolic diet. Dr. Di Pasquale does discuss it in the textbook I talked about on <a href="/blog/2011/10/protein/" target="_blank">Thursday’s post</a>, and I will read up on it. However, I do not like diets that have significant changes in eating strategy throughout the week. Diet is already something that is difficult enough to deal with, and I’d rather people adhere to a diet that would be something to adhere to for a lifetime (with changes in quantity when needed). Obviously I’m not a diet groupie, but I do agree with the principles of the Paleo diet and eating quality whole meals. However, this doesn’t mean I will shy away from a double bacon cheese burger (assuming the restaurant includes the cheese — what kind of place just sells a bacon burger with no cheese?).</p>

<p>I was wondering what your thoughts would be for someone who can only train twice a week? My wife is 8 months pregnant, and we have a 20 month old son, so at this point I am needed at home as much as possible. Since she is awesome she has not asked me to reduce or stop my training, but also because she is awesome I am taking it upon myself to reduce my training. My current plan is to run a modified 5/3/1 template like this:</p>

<p>Squat – 50% for 3 sets of 10</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A bunch of chins throughout the session</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aw, isn’t Paul a sweetheart? Good to hear from you again, though. This is an admirable set up, and I think it will work fine. Personally, I’m not a fan of pull-ups prior to benching or power cleaning OR chin-ups prior to pressing or deadlifting, but you may have to get some in the early part of the workout just to get them. Consider using a pyramid style set up on a clock at the end of the workout. Hit 1, then 2, and all the way up. A couple months ago I did this in a basement and got up to 8 or 9 in a couple minutes of time and caught a contagious pump that would have made Brent Fucking Kim proud.</p>
<p>Also, when relegated to a two-day-a-week program, adjust the carbohydrates or calories so you that you aren’t consuming as many as higher frequency program. Always maintain the protein, but I would tweak the carbs higher on training days and maybe even the day before training depending on what time you train. You’ll become a pro at this, so let us know how it works for you.</p>

<p>If it were me, I’d have my smoothie upon waking (with plenty of some kind of fat), I’d kill myself because I couldn’t cook eggs at work, and then I wouldn’t be alive.</p>
<p>Let’s try this again. In the morning I’d try and get myself to adapt to six eggs and bacon in the morning (may have to use five eggs at first, but with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lX1wJinYg" target="_blank">Chipotle Tabasco</a>, anything is possible). I’d probably eat a sweet potato with it. I might pre-make a shake to take to work for mid-morning (with some kind of fat). Then I’d eat some kind of meat meal at lunch (something I bring from home, not lunch meat), and maybe have some more sweet potato or the other half from breakfast. Then I’d have whey and a fast digesting carb an hour or so before I train. Then I’d eat a pound of beef when I get home. By the way, putting salsa and greek yogurt on ground beef (that has been seasoned with, say, rosemary and red pepper) is fucking money.</p>
<p><strong>Question to YOU</strong>: We need to start inducting guys to the 70’s Big Hall of Fame. We will done one a month. Who should be a nominee?</p>

  <p>I can’t say this any better than Mauro G. Di Pasquale, who is becoming a hero of mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, for those athletes involved in strength events such as the Olympic field and sprint events, those in football or hockey, or weightlifters, powerlifters, and bodybuilders, I recommend between 1.2 and 1.6 g of high-quality protein per pound of total body weight. That means that if you weigh 200 lb and want to put on a maximum amount of muscle mass, then you will have to take in as much as 320g of protein daily. There are several competitive weightlifters, powerlifters, and bodybuilders that I know who take in 2-3 g of high-quality protein per pound of body weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are trying to lose weight or body fat it is important to keep your dietary protein levels high. That is because the body oxidizes more protein on a calorie-deficient diet than it would in a diet that has adequate calories. The larger the body muscle mass, the more transamination of amino acids occurs to fulfill energy needs. Thus for those wishing to lose weight but maintain or even increase lean body mass in specific skeletal muscles, I recommend at least 1.5g of high-quality protein per pound of body weight. The reduction in claories needed to lose weight should be at the expense of the fats and carbohydrates, not protein (345).</p>

<p><strong>Protein for Strength Training</strong></p>
<p>This is very telling. Let’s look at each paragraph. The first paragraph discusses necessary protein intake based on body weight. This quote doesn’t just come from a diet or training book, it’s a no-shit textbook with literature reviews on everything related to amindo acids and proteins and applying it to athletics.</p>
<p>Earlier in the book there was a review of the literature concerning how the Recommended Daily Allowances were developed which resulted in the 1989 protein intake of .8g/kg in body weight. This is equivalent to .36g/lb — a horribly low number (a 200 lb male would be prescribed 72g of protein!). Peter Lemon (of Kent State) observed that these recommendations were for sedentary individuals and came up with the following recommendations in 1995: 1.4-1.8g/kg for strength athletes and 1.2-1.4g/kg for endurance athletes. This would be .63-.81g/lb for strength athletes and .54-.63g/lb for endurance athletes. A 200 lb strength athlete’s recommendations would be 126-162g of protein. This is better than the RDA, but still childishly low.</p>
<p>Dr. Di Pasquale’s recommendations of 1.2-1.6g/lb of body weight would have a 200 lb strength athlete between 240-320g per day. This is what we find as practitioners in training and coaching; having more grams of protein per pound of body weight is the first dietary error to address when recovery is an issue. Especially when training for three or more days per week.</p>
<p>Now let’s make this applicable. Have you stalled in your program? Are you unable to train efficiently because of lingering soreness in your back, hamstrings, or shoulders? Has your progress slowed? The <em>first</em> thing to look at is your daily protein intake. What is it? Oh, you don’t even know? Well have fun shoveling shit in the regular infantry, because Special Forces are not in your future.</p>
<p>Estimate your daily protein intake and compare it to Dr. Di Pasquale’s recommendations (which mimic the recommendations on this site of adding 50g of protein to your body weight in pounds). It’s probably low, so figure out a way to increase it. Now. Your training will improve.</p>
<p><strong>Protein for Fat Loss</strong></p>
<p>The textbook thoroughly (very thoroughly) details how protein is digested, metabolized, utilized, skibbytitized, and blabbitized. It covers everything. So when Dr. Di Pasquale — who has a Bachelor’s in biological science, a Master’s in molecular biochemistry, and a medical degree — says in the second paragraph that you need more protein when losing fat than you would otherwise, we should listen. His recommendation of 1.5g/lb would have a 200 lb guy taking in 300g of protein <em>when trying to lose fat</em>. Don’t skimp on protein when reducing or changing calories.</p>
<p>This textbook is full of very good info, and the more that I read it on the toilet, the more that I will share the gems with you.</p>

  <p>Running, burpees, turkish get ups, kettlebell swings, and…pain. That’s what <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/" target="_blank">Johnny Pain’s</a> new e-book, “<a href="http://strengthvillain.com/?page_id=20" target="_blank">50 More Greyskull Approved Conditioning Workouts for the Modern Viking</a>“, consists of. The model for all of the workouts is the infamous <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/?p=802#more-802" target="_blank">Bony</a>, who apparently is a glutton for punishment.</p>

<p>This e-book is pretty straight forward: it consists of 50 conditioning workouts that will make a man out of you. When I program conditioning for someone who is training for something, I primarily the entire workout to consist of efficient, large-scale movements that utilize a lot of muscle to use up as much energy as possible to induce the stress. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Dr-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1318436531&#038;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><strong>FIT</strong></a> I also talk about how to properly program the conditioning in accordance with your strength training. If you combine these elements with this e-book by JP, you have a repertoire of workouts to plug into your program.</p>
<p>There are a few workouts that use some slower movements, like floor whipers, lunges, and leg raises (interspersed with chin-ups), yet there is something to be said for getting through grueling sets of exercises. It does a few things: it provides a mental challenge without superfluous chipper-type workouts, it gets lots of muscular contraction which can assist in developing the look of muscles (see Arnold’s Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding if you’re confused), and they still provide a much higher relative stress compared to just straight lifting. In other words, the slower, arduous movements may not get maximum levels of stress, but for most people they won’t <em>need</em> those high levels of stress and can receive a benefit to conditioning and musculature with these other movements. Besides, a movement like the backwards crab walk — influenced by JP’s Airborne infantry background — is a good way to work on agility, mobility, and pissing blood.</p>
<p>Workout #14 is very similar to something that I have used once a week for a while: burpees alternated with kettlebell swings (this workout alternates them in 30 second increments). JP uses creative exercise and rest period combinations that I’m sure will give you plenty of ideas for your own training. The best part of it all is that the workouts are all short and intense; you get a lot of bang for your buck so that you can bang when you fuck. God damn, I should copyright that.</p>

  <p>Chris is a big, bad dude. One time, Mike, Chris, and I were leaving a bar and Chris was worried about the group of people his girlfriend was hanging out with. I don’t remember why he was mad, but I was convinced that I would have to go with him as he kicked these people’s door in and pick them up by the neck and bash their heads together like King Kong.</p>

    Chris and his rig
  </p>
</div>
<p>Chris has a pretty full schedule. He’s in his second year of grad school (getting his Master’s), teaches classes for his grad assistantship, and also has a part-time job. It doesn’t leave a lot of time and energy for training, but he gets it done nonetheless.</p>
<p>Chris squatting 610×3 on Saturday. Skip to :30.</p>

<p>Another time Chris and I went to a sports store and for at least half an hour we were making up full names that included Gordon, Todd, and Melvin. Chris suggested Todd McGordon-fuck. Gordon Todd McDugan-Fuck was one of mine. Gordon McTodd. Melvin O’Gordon. This went on for at least half an hour and we laughed the whole time.</p>
<p>A strange no-sound third attempt deadlift at 666 pounds (300kg) from USAPL Raw Nationals.</p>

<p>Despite his size and strength, Chris has excellent precision in various athletic movements with throwing and catching coming to mind. He has excellent hands and can gracefully throw any type of ball. We used to go to the pool and throw the tennis ball. He’d call me up, “Tennis ball?” and I’d say, “Yeah. Be right over.” Of course it would take me at least 45 minutes when I only lived across the highway, but it’s fiiine.</p>

<p>Another time we were eating breakfast at a diner in San Antonio, and Brent was being extra ornery. He was antagonizing Chris, so Chris said, “Ask me how much I squat Brent?”</p>
<p>“How much do you squat, Chris?”</p>
<p>“First, more than you…”</p>
<p>And that’s how it goes.</p>
