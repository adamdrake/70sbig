  <h2 id="learning-how-to-fail">Learning How To Fail</h2>
<p>There will be a point in a girl’s training when something will go wrong. This isn’t unique to females, but it’s more significant to them when it happens. When a guy fails a weight or busts his ass squatting, he’s embarrassed and ashamed, but typically more pissed off. He’ll mutter, “God damn it,” scrape himself off the floor, re-rack the weight, and try it again. He’s pissed, yet has a hint of competitiveness. This could be from playing sports in high school or a heightened relative aggression due to an evolutionary development that results in at least ten times the amount of testosterone. Either way, when girls who are new to training fail, they can get upset and will even cry.</p>
<p>It doesn’t always have to occur after an embarrassing ass-busting that results in everyone in the gym staring. Instead, it can occur with experienced girls who miss a much desired PR. Sorry if you’re a tough-guy girl who feels the need to respond to every discrepancy that isn’t aimed at you, but most girls will cry at least once in the gym.</p>
<p>This can be awkward or difficult, because most guys won’t know what to do (and will often just want to go make a sandwich). Yet it’s relevant, because focusing on “today” is erroneous when training is actually a process. Anybody who broods excessively over a shitty workout just ends up being a pain in the ass. You’re allowed to brood if you bomb out at a meet, but not if you miss a rep off of your work set. Failing is <em>supposed</em> to be a part of training. It <em>needs</em> to happen. If it didn’t, we wouldn’t get any better.</p>

<p>When someone fails or messes up in lifting — but specifically talking about girls here — and they are visibly upset about it, <strong>the first thing I do is explain what went wrong, and what we have to do to fix it</strong>. Things are not hopeless in the gym. Mechanics are easy to observe and easy to fix; we aren’t dealing with unknowable factors like shifts in gravity or constantly mutating bodies. I will diagnose what caused the failure — whether it’s inadequate recovery (sleep/food/stress/etc.) or a technical error — and explain how we are going to improve that thing. If it’s technical and there are still more sets, then I whittle this down to an easy cue (usually reiterating something we’ve been focusing on). If it occurred on the last set, then I might have a repeat of fewer reps at the weight, back off the weight and practice the cue, or if the person is smoked move on and worry about it next workout (but make a note in the log).</p>
<p><strong>The second thing I’ll stress is that this error, this failure, shouldn’t effect the rest of the workout</strong> or mindset in general. I’ll point out, “There isn’t anything we can do about it now, we know why it happened, and we know how to prevent it in the future.” If the lifter needs a few minutes to be pissy about it, I’ll give them that time, but then I’ll ask them forget about it. At nationals this year, Chris missed his third squat — something that I felt he really took pride in because of the progress he made on the lift in the last year (he has squatted 644 in competition). Chris really takes failures hard and was brooding, and this was the quote I used in the <a href="/blog/2011/08/nationals-recap/" target="_blank">post recapping that meet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I know you’re pissed and upset about squat, but we still have the rest of the meet. It’s time to step up and be a competitor — we can worry about that shit later, but let’s put all our focus into getting good reps on the bench and deadlift. Go take a walk and let it go on the walk. When you come back, let’s fucking have fun and compete.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris was pissed for a couple more minutes, took a short walk, came back focused, PR’d on bench, hit a really funny posing routine in the warm-up room, and then he summoned the demons for a PR deadlift of 666 pounds — the devil’s number — on his third attempt.</p>
<p>This may not be necessary in a training session, but if I need to, I’ll set a short-term parameter for the lifter to be pissed, and then we’ll wipe the slate clean and focus on what’s ahead instead of brooding on the past.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, I will put things in perspective.</strong> This is typically only needed with women because they have trouble with failure (they get really pissed and upset). I will show them the big picture and detail how far they have progressed. Women typically lift in the moment and are concerned with progress from their relative position and often ignore the fact that they are lifting twice as much weight (for reps) as they could when they started. This is usually combined with a “well done” speech and giving them a verbal pat-on-the-back for how far they’ve come. In all honesty, I think i’s impressive when a girl who couldn’t squat 90 pounds is now squatting 180 for reps. I think that’s really cool and something that 99% of women in the world are unable to do. I’ll usually point out that nobody in the building is capable of such a feat (typically true in a public fitness gym).</p>
<p>Failure is a regular part of lifting. It helps us learn how to improve physically, but it’s a marker of psychological success that can’t be emulated until it happens. It helps us diagnose the problem and fix it, but it helps us grow stronger mentally by not letting it get in the way of a training session, a meet, or progress. Failure also gives us a moment to sit on the mountain of success we’ve built, look down the trail we’ve traveled, and say, “Damn, I <em>have</em> come a long way.”</p>

  <p>_<strong>Happy PR Friday</strong> — post your training updates and PR’s to the comments. Also, if you participate in another sport besides lifting, I’m interested to hear about it.</p>
<p>Today’s post is written by my homie Jacob Cloud. Enjoy._</p>
<p><strong>Another Awesome Day</strong></p>
<p><em>By Jacob Cloud</em></p>
<p>You ever just have one of those fucking awesome days? I have them all the damn time. Sometimes I share them with Justin, and sometimes he decides to share them with you guys. Last summer, I had an epic day full of mustachiod awesomeness, and snapped some pics, and Justin put it up for all to see. Check it out <a href="/blog/2010/06/a-tale-worth-telling/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Not too long after, I was training at the best gym in Austin, Hyde Park Gym…wait, let me tell you a little something about Hyde Park Gym. Actually, <a href="Not too long after, I was training at the best gym in Austin, Hyde Park Gym...wait, let me tell you a little something about Hyde Park Gym. Actually, a picture is worth a thousand words:" target="_blank">a picture is worth a thousand words</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s awesome. So anyway, a few days after the article above, I walk into the gym, and I’m warming up for squats, and the front desk kid comes up and kinda sheepishly asks, “Hey man…are you Jacob, from 70sbig?” I knew I was going to like this guy right off the bat. Nevermind the fact that he knew my name from the sign in sheet. His next line guaranteed a bromance rivalled only by that of Justin and AC, or me and Kittensmash. He proceeded to comment, “Dang, you look bigger in real life.” It’s official – I fell for the guy. His name is Rory.</p>
<p>Now, Rory is no small fella himself. He ended his linear progression at about 5-foot-nuthin and 235 pounds, a big slap in the face to all you sub 6-footers complaining about becoming adult males. He and his dad also run a food trailer featuring delicious pork, which helps. The local paper wrote it up <a href="http://www.austin360.com/food-drink/dining/the-care-and-feeding-of-an-austin-food-1415894.html" target="_blank">here</a> and even described Rory as “a student and champion powerlifter with an easy charm that makes him a better customer ambassador than his dad, <a href="http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/221652_1702270886026_1515570380_31579100_5918208_n.jpg" target="_blank">whose gruff manner</a> takes some getting used to.” Nice. They spoke highly of the pig meat, too. Go to 3 Little Pigs. It’s road-trip-worthy. Trust me.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>This guy works his ass off in the gym (literally – behind the desk as well as in the squat rack), and is shooting to demolish some raw squat records in the USAPL this year and next. Here’s a vid of his latest 495lb single in the middle of a nasty Smolov training cycle – while cutting down to the 198 class.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFXW5Z-hxPI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Rory’s my spotter at the gym, my good luck charm when I need to hit a PR, and my counter during high rep deads. He recently started at UT’s school of Engineering, so he’s real, real good at counting. And more importantly, he can get me on campus, which is where this story gets awesome and back on track. When I found out about the museum of lifting that Jan and Terry Todd have created at UT’s Stark Center, he’s the first guy I schemed with. “Oh, WE’RE GOING!”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/2008/08-039-training/image014.jpg" target="_blank">Jan and Terry Todd</a> have been called “The strongest couple in the world.” Both champion powerlifters and educators, they’ve spent the last 50 years collecting the coolest lifting-related shit in the world, and recently, with the help of some guy named Weider, they opened up an exhibit that anyone can see. So I, Rory, and another of our lifting buddies, Marlon (whose lifting exploits are second only to his Brent Kim log-stalking), sauntered over to campus to check it out. Guess what? It was awesome.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some girl working the front desk didn’t allow me to bring my camera into the exhibit, so you’ll have to check it out yourself, like people such as Mark Henry and Bill Kazmaier have recently done. But as a teaser, let me tell you that the first exhibit consists of photos from Pudgy Stockton’s personal collection. You remember <a href="/blog/2011/10/03/" target="_blank">Pudgy</a>. Yup, awesome.</p>
<p>Another exhibit is full of photos of the old Arnie and Franco days. Lots of classic favorites and some that you’ve never seen before. A favorite of ours was of Jan Todd doing rack pulls…with over a thousand pounds. Without straps. Marlon pretty much quit his lifting career at that point and nearly killed himself on the spot when I asked “WWBKD?”</p>
<p>Did I mention there are tons of old strongman implements laying around? We managed to not get kicked out by lifting any, but I can’t guarantee you’ll have the same kind of will power. <a href="http://www.starkcenter.org/exhibits/current/" target="_blank">Check it out</a>, soon.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was completely awesome, amazing, and awe-inspiring, and all that. But we were hungry. Three adult males cannot just walk around for a couple hours without working up an appetite. I snuck this picture of Rory and Marlon next to their newest man crush, and we left in search of calories.</p>

<p>Rory knew exactly where to go, luckily. Dude knows his food. He led us to a BBQ trailer called the “Suga Shack,” famous for it’s biggest sandwich…the F-Bomb. F-Yes. A pound of various BBQ’d meats piled on to a roll, covered in jalapenos, pickles, onions, and queso. A 1 on the TIOLI scale, for sure .</p>

<p>We demolished our delicious sandwiches, went home, watched every Ricky Bruch video we could find and <a href="http://youtu.be/RpqksKiImCk?t=3m17s" target="_blank">threw around</a> a bunch of <a href="http://youtu.be/RpqksKiImCk?t=2m2s" target="_blank">weights and PRs</a> that night at the gym.</p>
<p>An Awesome Day, indeed.</p>

  <p>Maslow must be bored as shit at work, because he always sends me pretty awesome links. He sent me a list of <a href="http://www.muscleprodigy.com/the-top-30-most-jacked-nfl-football-players-2011-part-1-arcl-1974.html" target="_blank">Top 30 Jacked NFL Players</a>. I thought it was a decent list but it seems they were just looking at muscularity. Reggie Bush, for example, shouldn’t fucking be on the list.</p>
<p>Here are my impressions as I looked at the list:</p>

</div>
<p>– I bet standing next to <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1198/1140303009_6300decf6f_o.jpg" target="_blank">Mike Sellers</a> makes you feel small</p>
<p>– <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/22596/BobSanders03_medium.jpg" target="_blank">Bob Sanders</a> is a good athlete, but I wouldn’t consider him to be jacked enough to make this list</p>
<p>– There aren’t really any lineman on here, especially D-lineman</p>
<p>– Quincy Black is fucking legit</p>
<p>– So is <a href="http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2011/0109/nfl_g_matthews01_576.jpg" target="_blank">Clay Matthews</a>, but when you’re black your muscles stand out, so I’ll put a picture of Quincy instead</p>
<p>– MJD is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82pO-l4o5LQ" target="_blank">stout as fuck</a></p>
<p>– Who the FUCK is Igor Olshansky and whose dugan did he fondle to get on this list?</p>
<p>– Joey Porter is a queer. Didn’t he <a href="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/50354_7616742666_2673_n.jpg" target="_blank">get stiff-armed</a> by Kellen Winslow Jr. when Winslow had two gimp knees and Porter had shit-talked him all week?</p>
<p>– <a href="http://i53.tinypic.com/dqsxi1.jpg" target="_blank">Adrian Wilson</a>, absolute genetic freak</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.elporvenir.com.mx/upload/foto/18/9/8/confirma.jpg" target="_blank">Tim Hightower</a> could be more impressive. He wouldn’t make my list.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.houstondiehards.com/2009/04/barwincombine.jpg" target="_blank">Connor Barwin</a> would.</p>
<p>– So would <a href="http://www.muscleprodigy.com/the-top-30-most-jacked-nfl-football-players-2011-part-2-arcl-1975.html" target="_blank">James Casey</a>, but that’s enough white players.</p>
<p>– I’ve always thought <a href="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/8669/sims7pv.jpg" target="_blank">Ernie Sims</a> was jacked. And a genetic freak.</p>
<p>– Brian Cushing wouldn’t make the list because he’s a <a href="http://www.jerseyal.com/GBP/2010/05/cushing-cropped-2.jpg" target="_blank">dipshit</a>.</p>
<p>– Brady Quinn? Are you fucking serious?</p>
<p>– <a href="http://a.espncdn.com/media/motion/2010/0930/themag_Patrick_Willis_Body_Shot.jpg" target="_blank">Patrick Willis</a> is a specimen, but he wouldn’t crack my top 15 (he’s 13 here). Where are all jacked D-lineman (not the fat guys, but the ones who are truly jacked)?</p>
<p>– Of course <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DMaZD8qYm-A/TVmE8iRIpdI/AAAAAAAAtmo/7AjFxwTynVs/s640/Peyton+Hillis+%25288%2529.jpg" target="_blank">Peyton Hillis</a> would be here, but it makes me sad because Pat Shurmur is a FUCKING idiot who had Colt McCoy throw the ball 61 FUCKING TIMES and ran Peyton only 10. Peyton will be on another team next year and will kick major ass. It makes me sad.</p>

<p>– Terrell Owens’ half-brother was on my high school team when I was a sophomore. My friends started a joke that my friend Ted slapped him and ran off. Everyone believed it and it was put in the yearbook. Other than that, TO is yawn.</p>
<p>– Reggie Bush in the top ten? This countdown is pathetic.</p>
<p>– Getting better with <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/74661/orakpo_medium.jpg" target="_blank">Brian Orakpo</a> and <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2511/3763870381_cc3375360f.jpg" target="_blank">Greg Jones</a>. Jones is legit top ten.</p>

<p>Maybe we should make a list of top 30 yoked NFL players?</p>

  <p>Some readers are really interested in what my diet looks like. I’m the first to point out that it’s not perfect (or interesting), but whether or not there is a perfect diet is debatable anyway. I’m 6′ and usually weigh between 210 and 212 pounds. If I had to guess, I’d say my body fat is about 10%, however lower ab veins are said to be visible under 7 or 8%, so I guess I could be as low as 8 or 9%? In any case, my diet and training has evolved to the point that I’m stronger in most lifts than ever (with the exception of squat due to injury and overall body weight loss) while being the most lean and athletic I’ve ever been. Monday I pressed 220×3 on my third triple, and last week I push-pressed 260×2 on my fifth double after clean and jerking up to 315 for three singles.</p>
<p>I don’t really like talking about my training because I don’t like the lack of privacy inherent in a voyeur look at something that takes up a lot of my time (training, eating, recovering, etc.), especially when other aspects of my life will dictate and alter these activities. I’m not so narcissistic (like the late Zyzz) to think anyone really gives a shit anyway. The point is that I’m not that great, but I’m above average in most things to the point where my diet might be relevant. It’s not something that everyone needs to try and emulate, since I think diet is a very individualistic kind of thing, but hopefully you can get some pointers or ideas by looking at it.</p>

<p>My average day involves:</p>
<p>– Water, vitamins, and fish oil</p>
<p>– Fruit and whey protein smoothie</p>
<p>– 6 Eggs and bacon (random carb)</p>
<p>– Random meal (pre-workout is typically whey and random simple carb)</p>
<p>– At least one pound of meat, typically beef with salad and/or sweet potato</p>
<p>– Whey and sunflower seeds or peanut/almond butter</p>
<p>– Fishoil again</p>
<p>There are more specifics, but you can watch the video to hear them. The first three parts are always the same every day with slight variations (e.g. today I had 7 eggs), and the latter meals are variable. I’ll change things depending on if I have a high carb or sodium meal or if I drink a lot of alcohol (which is uncommon). This is sort of the baseline thing I do, and when there are significant perturbations, then I react in specific ways. I don’t shy away from awesome things like bacon cheeseburgers, waffles, or chocolate, but sometimes prepare my day around them or have set reactions to return to normal after eating them. In any case, enjoy the video. Oh, and the it’s kinda long, but it isn’t necessarily boring. Especially the beginning because I had just woken up.</p>

  <p>There is a misconception that the latissimus dorsi — commonly referred to as “the lats” — aid in the upward movement of the bar when benching. This has bothered me for a long time, so I have broken this down anatomically to explain why it isn’t the case. We will then learn what the lats actually do during a bench press to be so important.</p>
<p><strong>The Lat</strong></p>
<p>First, we must understand where the lat attaches as this will dictate everything it does. The attachment sites of a muscle obviously don’t change, and the muscle will contract to bring these bones together. It’s pretty easy to discern what actions that muscle causes after knowing the attachment sites (and why you learn bone anatomy prior to muscles, because the markers on the bones are where the muscle’s tendons attach).</p>
<p>The lat attaches onto the spine from the sacrum all the way up to the mid-thoracic spine (the lower it goes the more of an aponeurosis there is, but don’t worry about that right now). The fibers of the muscle angle upward and diagonal from the spine to the humerus (upper arm bone). The fibers cross behind and under the humerus and wrap around it to attach near the crest of the greater tubercle (a name for a mark on the bone). If you want to see the proximal attacchment, then <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Gray207.png" target="_blank">this picture</a> is an anterior (front) view of the humerus, and the lat will wrap around the left side of the picture (where it says ‘surgical neck’) to attach in the area indicated. For those who are kind of confused, just look at the picture below.</p>
<div id="attachment_5506" style="width: 317px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/2011/10/IMG_20111004_094357.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5506" data-attachment-id="5506" data-permalink="/blog/2011/10/lats-while-benching/img_20111004_094357/" data-orig-file="/2011/10/IMG_20111004_094357.jpg" data-orig-size="512,622" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Droid&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1317721435&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;108&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_20111004_094357" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/10/IMG_20111004_094357.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/10/IMG_20111004_094357.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-5506 " title="IMG_20111004_094357" src="/2011/10/IMG_20111004_094357.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="373" /></a>
  <p id="caption-attachment-5506" class="wp-caption-text">
    Notice how the lat wraps under the humerus (1)
  </p>
</div>
<p>**</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Actions</strong></p>
<p>Now that we know the attachment sites, we can see what will happen to the shoulder if the muscle contracts. The lat has “five movement roles at the shoulder, some more important than others: extension, adduction, horizontal abduction, flexion from an extended position, and internal rotation” (2). If you are confused on some of those movements, then watch <a href="http://youtu.be/13_Nq4QgALs?t=3m22s" target="_blank">this video</a> (will jump to shoulder section). The lat’s primary function is extension, yet it’s interesting attachment site allows it do some other things. We’ll see them crop up in the analysis below.</p>
<p>Since the lat is a shoulder extensor and medial abductor (pulling the humerus away from the mid-line — like a row), it obviously cannot flex the shoulder or medially adduct — the two primary movements that occur on the ascent of the bench.</p>
<p><strong>The Lat While Benching</strong></p>
<p>However, because the lat wraps around the under-side of the humerus, it is an internal rotator. Internal rotation in the shoulder when bench pressing, pressing, or doing push-ups is when the elbows flare out (closer to 90 degrees away from the torso). It inherently looks bad, but in the bench it prevents the force application from effectively being distributed throughout the anterior shoulder girdle. Furthermore, since the shoulder internally rotates, the external rotators are stretched and strained, resulting in injuries after chronically internally rotating (i.e. “I blew out my rotator cuff benching, bro”). Remember, when one muscle group contracts, the antagonist stretches (e.g. the triceps stretch when the biceps contract). Yet internal rotation when benching or pressing isn’t caused by the lats, but it’s an error made by the lifter that often results in injuries.</p>
<p>Instead, the shoulder should be in some degree of external rotation when benching (closer to a 45 degree angle) so that a) the external rotators are not stretched like they were in the last paragraph, b) it effectively distributes the load through the anterior shoulder girdle, and c) it stretches the internal rotators. This last point is the most relevant to our discussion.</p>
<p>In a mechanically efficient bench, the shoulders are pinched, the thoracic spine is extended to lift the chest, a big breath of air helps lift the chest even more, and the elbows are kept in external rotation while the forearms are vertical. This entire set up facilitates tightness — the shoulder girdle requires tension and tightness to perform optimally since it’s a joint that doesn’t have a lot of stability. This kind of set up allows the feet to drive the pinched upper back into the bench to solidify the articulation between the body and the bench. The more solid the body is on the bench AND the tighter the tension around the shoulder joint, then more force can be applied to the bar. If there was less tightness or stability, some arbitrary amount of force application would be lost due to instability (the same reason you can’t squat your 1RM on a Bosu ball or water bed).</p>
<p>We know that the attachment of the lat makes it an internal rotator. When the shoulder externally rotates, the internal rotators (the lats) are stretched. Throughout the descent of a bench, the lats shorten since the shoulder is experiencing extension and slight horizontal abduction. During the ascent, the lats are stretched a bit when the movement is reversed — this shows that they aren’t contracting during the ascent to “help the bar up”. However, since the shoulder maintains external rotation, the lats maintain a steady stretch, or constant tension, throughout the descent and ascent. When the lat maintains it’s tension it reinforces the shoulder and makes it incredibly more stable. Tension and stability equals more force application in the bench. Voila.</p>
<p>This concept of the lats maintaining tension is analogous to the hamstrings maintaining their tension in a squat or deadlift; the tensed muscle may not be applying force at a particular moment but is incredibly important to the execution of the lift.</p>
<p><strong>Recap</strong></p>
<p>To put it more simply, the lats don’t help apply force to the bar to make it go up, yet they are incredibly important for maintaining tensile force to make the shoulder joint stronger. Strong lats are required in good benches and will augment the ability to do all of this (which is why rowing and weighted pull-ups can help the bench).</p>
<p>Astute readers or skeptics will say, “Hey, but what about the ‘flexion from an extended position’ that was detailed in the muscle action list? This is pretty easy to show why this isn’t the case in the bench, but I’ll save it for another post. This post probably has plenty for people to digest.</p>

  <p>Mondays typically focus on the 70’s Big Female, but this is the next installment of the “Getting Girls to Train” series. Also check out Parts <a href="/blog/2011/08/getting-girls-to-train/" target="_blank">One</a>, <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-2/" target="_blank">Two</a>, and <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-3/" target="_blank">Three</a>.</p>
<h2 id="actually-getting-a-girl-to-train">Actually Getting A Girl To Train</h2>
<p>It isn’t easy to get women to start training when their entire lives they’ve been given bad advice and false hopes (don’t believe me? see <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/28/reebok-settlement-toning-sneakers_n_985141.html?ref=email_share" target="_blank">this</a>). Throughout this series the readers have said, “That’s great, but…how do I get my wife/girlfriend/sister/friend to actually do it?” This post will provide a step-by-step suggestion guide on getting your friend to actually begin.</p>
<p>Before we begin, it’s important to note that the goal of this process is to help a girl train better and smarter while getting better results. You’re supposed to be <em>helping</em> and <em>teaching</em> instead of belittling her current methods, “mainstream fitness, or “society” (we can bitch about this stuff another time). Subtly reply to her doubts and skepticism in a proper, non-confrontational tone. In other words, we aren’t hysterically trying to convert anyone, but instead aim to help.</p>
<p><strong>First, Present the Facts</strong></p>
<p>In order to move onto the “how”, you need to first present the “why”. If possible, suggest that your lady friend read this <a href="/blog/2010/09/a-note-to-the-average-woman/" target="_blank">amiable, friendly letter</a> I wrote (I may re-write it soon to improve it since I wrote it a year ago — I’ll post it here when I do). I originally wrote it for a friend who coaches at CrossFits so that she could show her clients why lifting would be beneficial. Allow me to summarize:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Summary of Strength Training Benefits for Women</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All women go to the gym and workout in order to “tone up”, yet this term actually means getting “lean and strong”. More exercise and less food is not the key to getting “lean and strong”; instead, better and more efficient exercise is key. Strength and high intensity endurance training require an active metabolism to recover from and adapt. The higher levels of metabolism will help eradicate fat. The increases in muscle will augment that metabolism, but don’t worry, with less than 10% of the testosterone that a guy has and makes it IMPOSSIBLE to grow excessive muscle or get bulky. Strength training also produces the sexy, womanly shape that every gal aims for.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting stronger and eating a better, protein-filled diet will heighten metabolism, improve the immune system, prevent sickness, eliminate fatigue, and increase bone density. Not to mention it will result in being strong and conditioned to better enjoy an active, healthy lifestyle. Oh, and did I mention getting strong? I know many girls who are stronger than most men, and they are no longer simply “average”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how that summary didn’t even criticize conventional methods? It may be necessary to explain why not to do cardio for 45 minutes and eat granola for breakfast or elaborate on why protein and squats would help, but let’s keep it simple. Start with the minimum and avoid sensory overload. The above is a pretty convincing claim.</p>
<p><strong>Second, Inspire and Motivate</strong></p>
<p>No, I’m not suggesting you put on a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxm3fqmRtQc" target="_blank">Matt Foley performance</a>, but a little inspiration can go a long way. After explaining the benefits of proper training, your friend may need convincing. Luckily, there are thousands of pictures and videos of great looking women — amateur or professional — who can inspire your friend. By now you’ll have a good idea of what she may aspire to look like, so start with women who fit that type. Obviously I’ve used pictures of Erin Stern recently because she isn’t grossly striated, is incredibly athletic, regularly strength trains (with lots of squats), and even does some versions of the Olympic lifts. I’ve even shown <a href="http://a4.l3-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/86/548301fb836b46c7883c710e05acbde8/l.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a>to a few girls and they are immediately motivated to buckle down and train hard.</p>

</div>
<p>Inspiring someone provides emotional stimulation that compels them to want to get better. On the other hand, motivating gives someone an incentive to do something. The inspiration may be optional (depending on the gumption of the friend), yet motivating them to begin training is necessary. After all, strength training is a completely new method of ‘working out’ that is incredibly unfamiliar to most women. Despite the facts presented above, they may still be resistance. You merely need to ask them to only try it. That’s it. Just try it.</p>
<p>However, they can’t just try once since an afternoon of squatting and getting sore doesn’t beget results. Ask them to try it for a month. Committing to longer is a harder sell, and if they flat out deny a month, you can at least try to get them to try for two weeks (after six workouts, they will probably be sold anyway). Be sure to add, “If after a month of diligent work you don’t see any improvements and want to go back to your old method of working out, then you can. Just try this for a month.” You can probably get a confirmation with this approach, and most girls will be excited to try it (depending on how good or bad you are at making them comfortable with the idea, explaining it, and, most importantly, by not being creepy).</p>
<p><strong>Third, Eliminate Fear</strong></p>
<p>At this point, you have had a soft sell, but you can’t let your guard down. They may go home and realize that they have to venture into the “weights side of the gym” and get nervous. Girls don’t ever go over there. Won’t all the guys be watching them? Won’t squatting be hard? It <em>sounds</em> hard, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, squatting is inherently hard, but we’re not going to tell them that just yet. Instead, make them comfortable with the idea and the process. Ensure that you, or some kind of professional (that you have prearranged) will be with them every step of the way. Having a friend in an unfamiliar place makes that place seem less intimidating. Besides, you can explain that every guy in there doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing anyway.</p>
<p>If possible, introduce them to a female friend who already does train (for our new trainee is no longer “working out”, but training). This may be the single most important thing you do for your friend’s training future. If another girl who has been through this process before — and who may even walk her through it — helps her along in the beginning, it will prove that anyone can do it. Your friend may be aesthetically, emotionally, or psychologically inspiring. She may even be your friend’s new training partner or coach. Having another like-minded girl there will show her that this isn’t a guy’s world, but women can also excel.</p>
<p>If possible, introduce her to a group of these girls. It would be even better if they had a training group that got together a few times a week (I know several of these across the country). CrossFits are a great place to meet people who train hard, and nowadays many of them have strength specific programs that can help provide a community for your friend.</p>
<p>Some of these possibilities are dependent on your relationship with this friend and who will be coaching her, but now you have options. At the very least, cover one of the following bases:</p>
<p>A) Assuage fears by writing off the stereotypical male gym population</p>
<p>B) Ensure her that you will help them learn during this trial month</p>
<p>C) Introduce her to one or more like-minded girls and if possible have your friend join their training group</p>
<p>D) Clarify that anyone can do it. Show her examples online of people who have transformed their life and bodies by improving their</p>
<p>E) Remind her that strength training is a skill that everyone must work at, even for guys who write for super cool strength websites</p>
<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>
<p>If you, the reader, follow this simple and concise guide, I’m sure you will be able to get your friend to try this different style of training. Your friend will see quantifiable progress in their log-book, get stronger, and enjoy seeing the weight increase on the bar. Women are great to work with because they are very pleased with their ability to get stronger — probably because the world told them it wasn’t possible. Be sure to create a good program for your friend and go ahead and throw in high intensity endurance training that progresses over time (see <a href="/blog/2011/08/getting-girls-to-train/" target="_blank">this post</a> for female program creation and <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-2/" target="_blank">this post</a> for adding in conditioning). You’ll see that I don’t mind avoiding deadlifts…for now. It’s acceptable since she’ll still squat, and <a href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/" target="_blank">RDLs</a> will develop her posterior chain better than deadlifts in the beginning anyway. Don’t forget to tweak her diet, primarily by increasing her protein intake so that the body recomposes itself in our month-long trial (see <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-3/" target="_blank">this post</a> for nutrition for a new female trainee). Other things can be tweaked later, but if she plans her meals around eating protein, she’ll eat less of the other crap and get more of the good stuff.</p>
<p>Good luck with this process. Be sure not to be an elitist, a condescending prick, an irritating pain in the ass, or a zealot. Remember, you’re trying to help your friend improve the quality and efficiency of her training. Report back with results.</p>

  <p><strong>Happy PR Friday</strong></p>
<p><em>Post personal bests and training updates to the comments.</em></p>
<p>When Ellee and I went to do the trapeze thing last Friday, there were at least five women who either did marathons or triathlons. They were probably between the ages of 25 and 45 and were all frumpy. One of them was wearing a marathon shirt so one of the girls asked her how many she had done. When she said she had done 32, the girls were impressed, “Oh my goodness! Thirty-two! Wow!”. I rolled my eyes, scoffed, and shouted, “Nobody cares!” (the last two aren’t true).</p>
<p>The world still defines long slow distance events as the premise that defines fitness. This marathoner, this Bastion of Fitness, carried body fat and did not have a healthy complexion. Guess what happened next? When she hopped off the 35 foot high platform to swing on the trapeze and wrap her legs over the bar…she couldn’t. This BASTION OF FITNESS lacked the strength to pull her knees up and throw her legs over the bar to hang upside down. Pathetic, but more so sad.</p>
<p>The 70’s Big community does a pretty good job of not being elitist concerning other forms of training, and I’d like to keep it that way. However it still bothers me when an irrelevant event like marathons are placed on a pedestal. Maybe it’s because everyone can get in their car and drive 26.2 miles and say, “Wow, what if you had to run that?” I guess there really isn’t an opportunity to look at five hundred pounds and think, “What if I had to lift that?” For example, a heavier average male black bear found throughout the U.S. weighs about 500 pounds. If you see one, the first instinct isn’t to wonder if you could lift it. Or if you could out run it in order to survive (you can’t — they can run up to 25 to 30 mph).</p>

    This black bear is unimpressed
  </p>
</div>
<p>It’s pretty unacceptable to not be able to put your legs over a bar and hang upside down. It’s not that this event is particularly specific to any relevant act in life, but the ability to do it should be a base line athletic capability. It’s kind of like PT tests in the military: they shouldn’t be the extent of your physical ability (or the primary measure thereof), but instead should be a minimum capability that someone can do randomly if needed (it’d be better if the events were more specific and relative to the job itself, but that’s neither here nor there).</p>
<p>I honestly feel I could train for a short amount of time and do a marathon. It would fucking suck, but things like that are more of a mental challenge than a physical challenge. The previously mentioned BASTION OF FITNESS revealed that she did a marathon at the north pole. Immediately upon hearing that I wanted to do a weightlifting meet at the north pole. Then I remembered that the north pole is located in the middle of the fucking Arctic Ocean, therefore it’s not possible to claim that you have run a marathon there, much less visited.</p>
<p>I’m just unimpressed with the average marathoner or triathlete. This doesn’t mean I don’t respect the good ones. I have a friend who has been to the Boston Marathon, and we’ve participated in a 1.5 mile run. He fucking smoked me, and I did it in about 10 minutes. But for the average goober, running is not the mark of health, capability, and most importantly, athleticism. But neither is only being able to lift. Play sports, work on agility, sprint around, maintain mobility — do these things so that marathoners don’t have anything on you. Not to mention you’ll actually be able to participate in random trapeze sessions. And bears will <a href="http://monsterrebellion.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/gfbear.jpg" target="_blank">high five</a> you.</p>
<p>Edit: I still need to edit/upload Ellee doing the trapeze, but here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWV6XX9hZ4" target="_blank">my vid</a>.</p>

  <p>Two of the main components that make up the human body are protein and water. You may have a fundamental understanding of what these nutrients do and why the body needs them, but I think that you would pay more attention to their intake if you had a better understanding. Most readers know that they need at least one gram of protein per pound of body weight, but for someone who is training hard and actively trying to build lean body mass, they need much more. Water is similar, because you should have more than just an adequate amount to prevent dehydration. Maximize your training by solidifying your protein and water intake.</p>
<p><strong>Protein</strong></p>
<p>Protein is derived from a Greek word, “proteios”, meaning “of the most important”. On average, a human body is about 18% protein and is an essential part of pretty much all body tissues and components including muscles, hormones, antibodies, enzymes, cell membranes, and skin. In other words, protein isn’t just used for repairing and building muscle, but creating and maintaining all structures in the body. An average, non-training person would do well to consume close to their body weight (in lbs) in grams of protein; it would significantly improve their metabolism, energy levels, immune system, and subsequently overall health. However, I typically recommend that guys who train get at least 50g more than their body weight with the hardest training guys upping that to at least 100g over their body weight. The first goal for women is to get their intake closer to their body weight, and they can titrate it up to 30 to 50g over their body weight after observing their recovery and body composition changes (women are more sensitive to total calories than men, hence my typical recommendation isn’t “get x more than body weight”).</p>

<p>It’s best to get the majority of macro nutrients through food, yet protein supplementation is an excellent way to garner the desired daily amount. Whey protein supplements usually only differ regarding extraneous ingredients and superfluous marketing tactics. Whey protein can consist of concentrate, isolate, and hydrolysate (I like <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/whey-isolate-concentrate-hydrolysate/" target="_blank">this article</a> for the difference). Standard whey protein concentrate will satisfy most everyone’s goals who read this site; it’s cheapest and pretty much has an equal effect to the others. Concentrate is digested faster and has more BCAAs than food protein. These BCAAS can have a positive influence on metabolism and the immune system, but it’s also due to the fact that overall protein intake has improved. Remember: it isn’t the speed in which the protein is digested and utilized, but the chronic effect of consuming “enough” protein over time that is important.</p>
<p>If you have a sensitivity to lactose, then check out whey isolate as the trace elements of lactose are removed in its processing. Lactose sensitivity may be a factor that can be improved if you’re white, yet other races (Asian, black, hispanic, etc.) have more trouble with it. If you’re one of the people that have complained to me about a rumbling tummy from whey, get the isolate and test it. If you still get an upset tummy, take small doses and work them up over time. If you still have problems, then cry me a river.</p>
<p>Lastly, research and purchase quality raised animal meat. The better that they are raised (grass fed, no hormones, etc.), the more nutrients they will contain. Remember that meat should be the largest aspect of your protein intake and whey supplementation should get tacked onto it. I deem it acceptable for guys to get 100g of whey a day, but I’d prefer it to be 50 to 75g (implying that more meat is eaten in the latter scenario).</p>
<p><strong>Water</strong></p>
<p>The body primarily consists of water with “percent of body weight” figures ranging from 70% down to 50% in old crones. Most people think about water in terms of staving off dehydration since “dehydration is bad”. It’s much more important than that. I’ve summed this topic up to Brent by saying, “Water is necessary for almost all reactions and enzymes in the body. If you don’t have plenty of it, then your body won’t be functioning optimally.” He told me weeks later that it was that comment that immediately made him consume more water.</p>
<p>Think about everything that occurs in your day. You wake up and try to have energy for work or school. You eat, train, do mobility, and sleep well because you want to get mega jehcked. Well, every one of those things will be hampered by a lack of hydration. Your food won’t be digested as well, your energy levels will subside, your training won’t be efficient, your joints, muscles, and fascia will be stiff and sticky, and you’ll generally reduce the quality of everything you do during the day (including trying to lose body fat and grow muscle). It’s all a result of the normal chemical reactions in your body not working as well since they’re scrounging for ingredients. If you’re going to spend all this time giving a shit about your training, then set yourself up to optimally succeed.</p>
<p>Just don’t carry a gallon of water around like a dickhead. And certainly don’t take it into the gym. If you do, then the sleeves of your shirt will fall off and your nipples will show. I’ve always hated the guy in a public gym who carries his water jug around, trying to show off how serious he is as if anyone gives a shit. Then they open their lips and relax the jaw as they gulp liquid in front of other guys grunting. Do not do this.</p>
<p>Instead, half your body weight and drink at least that many ounces in a given day. If you weigh 200 pounds, then you’ll aim for at least 100 oz. This is about five bottles of water and the minimum. I like to keep liter sized bottles of water in the fridge so that they are cold and easily accessible. If you’re in public, at work or traveling, then carry a water bottle with you or hit up most of the water fountains you see. When I’m on a plane, I ask for water, chug it, and get a quick refill. When I’m driving long distance, I’ll have a liter sized bottle with me.</p>
<p>“But Justin, isn’t it easier to carry a gallon, and then you’ll know how much you’ve drank?”</p>
<p>Carrying a gallon makes you look like a shit head. You cannot store it easily in your bag, you look like you a glutton when tipping it to your face when it’s mostly full, and you look like a big gay fish when wrapping your lips around it. Not to mention water is regularly available every where you go in America and you can easily refill everywhere and anywhere. Stop being a diva about it and just drink more throughout the day.</p>

  <p>How much mobility have you done today? In the last few days? Last week? Mobility is but one of the helpful and necessary aspects of recovering and training well. After seeing the mobility capabilities of my new friends in Chicago, I realized that they suck. Badly.</p>
<p>I hope that regularly bringing up the topic will a) remind you to do mobility, b) influence you to do if if you don’t, c) simplify the complicated realm of mobility, and d) show you some alternate techniques to improve your ‘mobility’. It’s important to include this kind of stuff regularly because they can help prevent some common injuries or tweaks that are associated with bad posture, lifting technique, or general tightness over time. Everyone has individual body dimensions, muscular structure, and tightness, so each stretch may not effect the same tissues on you as your friend.</p>

  <p>I just got home from the 70’s Big Workshop Weekend in Chicago. We had a really good group and it was a fun weekend. I want to thank Greg from <a href="http://www.bulldogbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bulldog CrossFit</a> for hosting the lifting portion on Saturday and Ellee from <a href="http://acu4athletes.com/" target="_blank">Acupuncture for Athletes</a> for hosting the programming portion on Sunday.</p>

<p>As we talked about programming on Sunday evening, I thought of a concept that would be relevant to readers of this site. I could talk for hours about programming (as the attendees observed on Sunday). I could write thousands of words on it (and have in the <a href="/ebook/" target="_blank">TM E-book</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Dr-Lon-Kilgore/dp/0615497063/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1317079743&#038;sr=1-1" target="_blank">FIT</a>). I will continue to not only write about aspects of programming, but the other forms of content on this site: mechanics, nutrition, curls, supplementation, recovery, mobility, curls, sports, curls, lifters of yore, and, of course, curls. I put a lot of thought into programming and helping you in various ways to help you program, but when you sit down to actually do it — for yourself or others — keep it simple.</p>
<p>I showed a few programs to the attendees that will be in upcoming e-books as well as templates that I have and currently use on myself. I gave them reasoning for the placement of every item and rep scheme. However, I don’t want them to have sensory overload or over-think the process when actually doing it. Simply focus on what your goal is, pick a rep scheme that would work towards that goal, and utilize the basic barbell lifts into a weekly template. Sprinkle in a few assistance exercises or conditioning activities and you’re set. Don’t feel the need to over complicate the process just because I give many details and reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Trapeze</strong></p>
<p>Last Friday I did trapeze by the lake in Chicago. I regret to inform you that it is not in my speedo. Yet we hung upside down from the bar, did back flips, and got caught when upside down by another trapeze dude — you know, the thing that happens in Batman and Robin, except I didn’t die (couldn’t find that scene on YouTube). I also had tremendous pain in the proximal gastrocnemius from hanging upside down from my knees. It wasn’t Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness; it was Immediate Fucking Soreness.</p>
