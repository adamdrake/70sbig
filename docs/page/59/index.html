  <p>Unfortunately some of you thought this was related to the Misc forums. I’m not edemucated about that, but here are a few smaller topics.</p>
<p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Remember that whole community thing from yesterday? Well, this community likes seeing how you do in training. Did you hit a lifting PR that you’ve been chasing? Are you reaching your body composition or weight gaining goal? Did you help people push their truck out of the road (something I did twice in 18 hours when in Texas — I forgot to mention it)? Tell us about it in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Chicago Workshop Weekend</strong></p>
<p>I’m traveling to Chicago tomorrow to do the Workshop Weekend (Lifting on Saturday, Programming on Sunday) in Chicago. I worked on and improved the lectures on both days, so if you’re still interested in coming, there are a couple spots still open. <a href="/programming/workshop-weekend-chicago-sept-2425/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE FOR INFORMATION AND PURCHASE</a>.</p>
<p>When I travel I post things on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, so check those out. I am going to cry myself to sleep because I’ll miss a portion of the football games. I’ll just have Jacob Cloud text me drunken updates.</p>
<p><strong>Conan</strong></p>
<p>I’ve held an exact replica of Conan’s sword that was made by the son of the guy that made it for Arnold (in Spain, I think). This replica was sharp, heavy, and usable. It was also owned by a guy named Conan (I’m not making this shit up). It’s the same thing that Arnold used; at first they gave him some kind of lighter crap-sword, and he basically said, “Fuck that, I want the real deal.” In all of the scenes, Arnold is using a real, razor sharp sword.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5451" data-permalink="/blog/2011/09/misc/conan-1/" data-orig-file="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg" data-orig-size="400,304" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="conan-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg" src="/2011/09/conan-1.jpg" alt="" title="conan-1" width="400" height="304" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5451" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Tactical Strength Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Every now and then I drop the ball with something. For example, that whole trying to make several fantasy football leagues thing? Yeah, I dropped the ball there (<a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/leagueoffice?leagueId=362504" target="_blank">here’s the actual league</a> with some of the guys from the site including Cloud, Briskin, Chris, Kittensmash, and Stroup). But I didn’t realize how soon the official TSC was…it’s this weekend. Go to <a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com">www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com</a></a> to see the ruling on this even that has a three attempt max deadlift, maximum pull-ups, and max kettlebell snatches in a 5:00 time period. There are varying divisions for men and women (including weighted pull-ups and a heavier KB for the men’s elite division) as well as gyms holding official events this Saturday. I scrolled through and saw various acquaintances or friends in Sacramento, Denver, and Fort Wayne. The TSC is an interesting way to test yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>As far as recovery and nutrition are concerned, what are you deficient in? This could be sleep, water, protein, carbs, fat, vitamins, minerals, mobbing, etc. What is the thing that you need to improve?</p>

  <h2 id="708217s-big-turns-2">70’s Big Turns 2</h2>
<p>On September 22, 2009, the <a href="/blog/2009/09/beginnings/" target="_blank">first post</a> of 70’s Big was published and had fewer than 100 page views. The first few posts were named after Chicago songs, and KittenSmash was the first person to comment (<a href="/blog/2009/09/prologue/" target="_blank">second post</a>). The concept of 70’s Big swelled after six months of joking around with the Chris, Brent, AC, and Mike — guys that you regularly see on the site (their training logs are linked on the left side bar). I figured the jokes would make an entertaining and educational website, and so started the process in September.</p>
<p>In that first year there was a heavy emphasis on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI7-o5Ryrbw" target="_blank">lifting big</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91GpAad4-hU" target="_blank">eating big</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYgSWsp_O64" target="_blank">getting big</a>. Yet, year two saw the site shift into quality over quantity, emphasizing the finer points of programming, diet, conditioning, and even health. As you get more experienced, so should your ability to tweak your program and dial in your diet to lift and look Herculean. And don’t forget the committed intensity and fervor necessary to not just achieve, but elbow drop your goals.</p>
<p>This site has always aimed to a) entertain, b) educate, and c) have a fun time doing it. In order to garner and harness your attention, I have to do <a href="/blog/2010/07/this-post-is-not-homo/" target="_blank">really weird shit</a></p>
<p>There is no zealotry in recommendations, only that strategies are derived from a baseline of anatomy, physiology, and the body’s adaptation to stress. There is no 70’s Big diet or workout. I guess sometimes we make fun of bodybuilding, but usually directed at a bro who is acting like a goober. CrossFit probably receives a jape every now and then, but I’m sure their skin is covered with plate armor made of $100 dollar bills papier-mâchéd together. The point is that this is a community that is open to new people, helps people, and has a good time along the way.</p>

<p>To date, there have been 530 posts, 18,759 comments, a conservative estimate of 4,250,000 total page views, and lots of good memories. Through this site I’ve interacted directly with hundreds, and probably a few thousand people. Everyone I interact with, American or otherwise, are always fantastic people (<a href="/blog/2011/08/thanks/" target="_blank">see this post</a>). I wish that I had the time to talk with all of the top blokes, but it’s hard to keep track of everyone. If you have sent me a message or an e-mail and didn’t hear back from me, you weren’t ignored! I do my best to reply to everything, but a good portion of messages are unread and lost.</p>
<p>In the last year I’ve started doing the female posts to help get girls involved in training and lifting, <a href="/programming/" target="_blank">70’s Big Workshops</a> (lifting or programming) have increased in frequency (including going overseas to Australia), I put out <a href="/ebook/" target="_blank">The Texas Method E-book</a>, and Dr. Kilgore, Dr. Hartman and I published an applied fitness book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497063/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&#038;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&#038;pf_rd_t=201&#038;pf_rd_i=0615390722&#038;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#038;pf_rd_r=1ASN7JFP7YG5VVDH4F5T" target="_blank">FIT</a>. Some bigger projects on the horizon include changing the theme of the site, creating a new general FAQ, finishing Part 2 of the Texas Method e-book, putting out several smaller helpful e-books to help your training. If you are interested in hosting a workshop or advertising on the site, then <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com" target="_blank">shoot me an e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the guys that have been reading this site for the entirety of its existence like Cloud, Kittensmash, Briskin, Yosh, and I think Cory (Edit: And Mark, Maslow, Ryan, etc.). I’m sure there’s more, but I feel like I’m good friends with you guys and I haven’t even met half of you in person. Thanks to all of you other regulars on the site; your interaction makes things fun. As for you other creepers who read every day and don’t comment, jump on in, the water’s fine. I’ve also recently heard that there is a site (or collection of them) that hate 70’s Big? I dunno, if they hate us, then I couldn’t imagine ever wanting to train with them. If after a good read through of the content and how this site aims to have fun and help people they STILL hate us…then I’d have to ask, “How much do you fucking curl, sir?”</p>
<p>Most of the readers know that everything is all in good fun and getting extremely butt hurt about disagreements isn’t a mature trait. Speaking of which, you guys are allowed to disagree with me and discuss various topics. There is a lot I don’t know and I freely admit that regularly. Philosophically an argument is a discussion about a topic, and society is almost incapable of achieving that these days without getting pissed off. If you act like a dickhead, I’ll treat you like a dickhead. But feel free to question the things that I say (when relevant, don’t get all Socrates on me), and maybe it will help both of us learn.</p>
<p>There aren’t too many internet communities that aren’t a pain in the ass, and I thank the seven that this community is one of the cool ones. We wear tank-tops and flannel, press women and animals, and drink red wine. Come at me, bro.</p>

  <p>This video will help you understand anatomical movement terms. By knowing and understanding these terms, it can standardize the way we talk about movement whether it’s in an actual lift/exercise, mobility, injuries, or rehab.</p>

  <p>In the “Getting Girls to Train” series, I aim articles at you, the reader, in hopes that you can use them to help a female in your life — friend, girlfriend, wife, relative, etc. — get into training. In <a href="/blog/2011/08/getting-girls-to-train/" target="_blank">Part 1</a> I gave some basic guidelines on how to create a strength program for her and in <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-2/" target="_blank">Part 2</a> we talked about why monotonous time spent doing “cardio” isn’t necessary as well as how to incorporate simple high intensity endurance workouts into a strength program. Today’s Part 3 concerns with ‘eating right’.</p>
<p>If you remember the <a href="/blog/2011/08/improving-diet/" target="_blank">Improving Diet</a> post, you’ll remember that I’m not a stringent diet groupie. More importantly, I’m not an advocate of completely changing everything about a person’s diet because it’s the hardest habit to alter. Instead, I like to recommend small steps to improve eating, make it habitual, and then take the next step by addressing big things first, then focusing on the little things. It’s analogous to acting as a page, then a squire, and then being accepted into knighthood (with even fewer being raised to lords).</p>
<p>Women who are new to training are no different in that I would ask for gradual changes over time, yet the process is different than a typical guy’s. Societal and government sources would have the public believe granola bars, oatmeal, and orange juice is a healthy breakfast. Carbohydrates, especially the processed variety, run rampant. My first order of business with new female trainees is to <strong>get them to eat more protein</strong>.</p>
<p>Typically girls, especially those who don’t train, don’t gorge superfluously (unless they’re high?). By getting them to focus on having protein in every snack or meal, they will not only eat more of it, but they won’t have as much of an appetite for other crappier food sources.</p>

    Erin Stern has trained for 15+ years and some how didn't get bulky
  </p>
</div>
<p>Protein won’t make a girl bulky, especially since she not only hasn’t had a history of accidentally becoming bulky but more importantly females only have 5 to 10% of the testosterone that a male has. Instead, protein is the most abundant molecule in the body that is a major structural component of all cells — muscle, organs, hair, and skin — and helps regulate metabolism, form blood cells, and supports the immune system. The average woman is deficient in protein intake, and she will significantly improve her health by consuming more if it…even without exercise.</p>
<p>Then we compound this new-found protein intake with a proper program (<a href="/blog/2011/08/getting-girls-to-train/" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="/blog/2011/09/getting-girls-to-train-2/" target="_blank">this</a>), and she is on her way to being <strong>lean and strong</strong>.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.crossfitannandale.com/" target="_blank">Courtney Modecki</a>, a female oddly enough, is in agreement with the “progressive steps” method of improving diet with women. She pointed out to me that it’s a sensitive issue since ranging from eating disorders to emotional issues with eating as a result of obesity. We both agreed that eating breakfast is one of the first progressions we would urge, along with increasing protein intake.</p>
<p>Courtney pointed out that she found it easy to get women to adapt to eating whole eggs. Some girls can be weary of meat (for whatever reason), but eggs are cheap and can be easily prepared to preference. Since each egg has the protein equivalent of an ounce of meat, they are a significant addition to a female diet.</p>
<p>Lastly, whey protein added into smoothies is another form of protein intake that is acceptable and easy to a female new to training. Whey is perfectly acceptable for any type of trainee, although it shouldn’t be relied on for the primary source of protein in a day. 50 grams of protein can be consumed through whey by women — this would typically leave another 100 grams for them to consume in food. In comparison, that number can be 75 to 100 grams for a male, and it leaves 100 to 150 grams for the average guy to eat through food. It doesn’t matter if a majority of the protein is consumed all at once, but typically we aim for a distribution throughout the day to prepare the body for training as well as recovering after.</p>
<p>The diet topic, especially concerning women who need to change it, can be extensive. Courtney and I have will explore this topic in future “70’s Big Female posts” on Mondays.</p>

  <p><strong>Happy PR Friday</strong> — post your week’s personal bests or training updates to the comments.</p>
<p>There are two sides to a successful heavy lift: the <a href="/blog/2011/09/attacking-the-rep/" target="_blank">volitional violence</a> at a critical point in the lift coupled with a pre-existing shot of adrenaline. The former consists of gritting your teeth and ripping through each rep. The latter, however, is more of a skill that has to be developed over time. Considering that I’ve raised my heart rate by 50 beats per minute while sitting in a chair getting ready to squat, I’ll draw on my own experiences while combining some simple stuff I learned while studying sport psychology a few years ago.</p>
<p>Most people, especially stereotypical powerlifters, will use music as their source of external motivation. Even your average friend will have an image of a guy listening to inexplicable death metal and screaming prior to a lift that represents a similar range of motion to Stephen Hawking’s squat. This isn’t always the case, but douche bags — as well as mammoths — do exist.</p>
<p>Now consider the opposite side of the equation: the crafty champion. He is a man who wears an armored suit of serenity, yet his mind is full of wroth. He is courteous to the judges, undergoes his routine, seamlessly hits his lift, and pays homage to the crowd after a personal best. He has learned to summon the dragons from within.</p>
<p>Causing a raucous prior to lifting is a young man’s method of boosting his adrenaline; it’s more primal, easier to do. Yelling and flailing about is an external method of raising adrenaline, because the actions are typically associated with anger, action, and violence. Let’s learn how to develop the mental aspect of lifting.</p>

<p><strong>Create a Routine</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever seen an Olympic athlete perform in person? They will do the exact same thing prior to each lift every single time. I’ve been at several meets with Chad Vaughn, a two time American Olympian in the 77kg class and gold medal winner in the 2003 Pan American Games, and each lift has the same routine regardless if it’s a training meet or a big meet. Weightlifting is inherently different than powerlifting, yet high level experienced powerlifters probably do this as well.</p>
<p>&lt;br/. In any case, set up a routine that you are capable of doing in any environment (your meet won&rsquo;t occur in your garage). Routines are a combination of physical and mental acts that breach the realm of preparing you psychologically and physiologically. You may approach the platform from the back, stop, visualize the lift in your head seamlessly three times, then approach the bar, set-up properly yet not slowly, and perform the lift. If you do this on every significant rep in training, then when you perform the routine at a meet, whether it&rsquo;s a local or nationals, it will emulate what you do every day in training. It will make things regular despite a judge staring you in the face, not having a mirror in front of you, or having a crowd of people in front of you. Most, if not all, successful single event athletes will have routines because they mentally prep them for success.</p>
<p><strong>Visualization</strong></p>
<p>That preparatory routine can merely be a physical action (i.e. approaching the platform, tightening the belt, shrugging the shoulders to remind yourself to finish the pull on a snatch), but it will be augmented significantly by some mental techniques. One of the easiest to use is visualization (also called imagery). This is just a mental image of <em>something</em>. It will be best if the lift itself is visualized with success, often including a single cue (similar to basketball players and free throws), yet can consist of…well, anything.</p>
<p>When I played football, I thought of blowing up a full-back who was trying to kick me out on an iso. Nowadays, it’s more general and includes more self-talk (next section), yet I like to visualize the cue itself. Instead of a full range of motion squat, it might be the specific explosive bounce out of the bottom. Instead of the entire snatch, it will be ripping through the second pull. AC has told me he imagines an army of zombies attacking people he loves (don’t ask). Much like general “pump-up methods”, I see an evolution of maturity in them. Early on, they will be focused on violence and mayhem, and later on they will be more specific and subdued. They focus on the success of the lift instead of a general heightening of systemic energy.</p>
<p>For me, visualization is just a quick image flashing in my head. I often combine several images as my adrenal intensity builds up over the course of a few seconds. I like to imagine my system ramping itself up like a whirlwind. As the whirlwind increases in intensity, I’ll use different types of self talk to make it specific to the type of lift I’m doing. Visualization is important — and works best when visualizing the successful lift itself — yet it is just a piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Self Talk</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t merely a simple, “C’mon! Let’s go! Yay!” This can be a combination of any word phrase that can increase your adrenaline. Again, early on, music was the inspiration for this, but I’ve been in gyms for over a year that not only don’t have music playing, but have TVs on (I hate TV). It’s hard to sum up the self talk that I use, because it’s so specific to each situation. It’s more of a stream of consciousness combined with certain aspects of visualization.</p>
<p>Self talk can consist something like Kirk Karwoski’s “I <em>own</em> that bar.” There was an article in Iron Mind that talked about how Kirk stared at his bar for ten minutes while listening to metal before he hit his top set of the day. For him, it was all about <em>owning</em> that fucking bar. It was <em>his</em>. And I think this can provide a good lesson: the self talk works in accordance with your overall attitude and visualization.</p>
<p>One method is to imagine the bar as your opponent; you <em>won’t</em> let it beat you. Other methods are to focus on the cue and let your mantra be, “Bounce…bounce…bounce…” as you go through your visualization. I consider myself pretty good at being able to pump my friends up, and I’ve used all kinds of methods. I’ve convinced them to prove someone wrong. I’ve convinced them to hit the lift for someone they’ve cared about. I’ve challenged them to not let the bar beat them. I’ve given them single cues to think about, and nothing else. These, however, are all externally provided to the lifter. You need to develop the ability to do it on your own when no one is watching.</p>
<p>This is why it’s so hard to articulate what works for me, because it’s something that has developed unique to me over time. I’m pretty decent at all different types of lifts, quick or slow, so my approach is more broad. Think about what really motivates you in the moment. Not what motivates you as you read this, sitting down and acting docile, but what motivates you when you have 15 seconds before you lift. I can think words like, “get this shit” and “bounce”, but often I just think of a swelling uproar while a mantra of phrases run through my head. Do you need to imagine you’re in an arena? Do you need to imagine you’re possessed? Do you need to imagine the battle of <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GBGXay-XpGc/Tf86FjMr-KI/AAAAAAAADvE/2ekvBmlup1s/s1600/Rhaegar%2Bvs%2BRobert.jpg" target="_blank">Robert Baratheon and Rhaegar Targaryen</a>? Does the situation itself provide enough adrenaline and you merely have to focus it into correct technique?</p>
<p>It’s possible that none of this is necessary. Brent is someone who is seemingly mentally quiet. Whatever he thinks about prior to a lift, it gets him ready most of the time (the other few times I think he would benefit from <em>some</em> excitement). The trick is finding out what you need prior to the lift and doing it. But it should evolve and adapt over time as your body adapts; acting like a silly savage won’t be acceptable forever. Figure out how to get yourself amped without the superfluous use of music. Besides, cavemen didn’t have music.</p>

  <p>A lot of you have shoulder issues, and they can be alleviated by improving two primary things: internal rotation and thoracic flexibility. Here are some videos that help with internal rotation from <a href="http://mobilitywod.com" target="_blank">MobilityWOD.com</a>.</p>
<p>This entire video is good.</p>

<p>These merely hit the internal rotation aspect, so start working on those and in a few days I’ll do a post on working on the thoracic area. Feel free to ask any types of questions regarding range of motion, flexibility, and how it pertains to lifting.</p>

  <p>About two years ago I was doing my squats on the Intensity Day of the Texas Method program I was on. I was doing singles across at 495 (my memory has always been doubles, but I can’t find it in my training log), and the third and fourth reps looked really ugly. The fourth one was what I like to call a holy grinder (sung to the tune of <a href="http://youtu.be/bkysjcs5vFU?t=47s" target="_blank">Holy Diver</a>), and Rip looked at me and said something like, “Well, that was bone on bone. You’re done.” I didn’t like that and said, “Nah, I’ll get the next one.”</p>
<p>So I saddled up for the fifth rep with adrenaline leaking out of my ears and aiming to bounce the shit out of the rep. At the time I remember that I didn’t really remember the rep; but I bounced it so hard and fast that Rip was stunned at how easy I made it look given that the previous rep was so hard. This, my friends, is the difference between going through the motions and attacking the rep.</p>
<p>There are two sides to a successful heavy lift: the volitional violence at a critical point in the lift coupled with a pre-existing shot of adrenaline. This post concerns the former.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get in a habit of merely stepping out with a weight on your back and squatting instead of attacking every. single. rep. This concept is hard to explain, but it’s most noticeable in the Olympic lifts. Many beginning Oly lifters are thinking of so many different things that it almost seems like they stand up with the weight, and then fall into their squat. Ripping through the second pull is the most important part of these lifts — that hip extension should be the fastest, most violent thing that person can generate out of their body. It’s the difference in trying to cut someone with your longsword or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHMT8b1hOdM" target="_blank">cleaving a head off</a> (horse head, not real); the difference in trying to hit someone and <a href="http://youtu.be/JHnL7wqtQLs?t=3m15s" target="_blank">knocking them the fuck out</a>.</p>
<p>Lifting isn’t church. It isn’t afternoon tea. It’s a form of controlled rage directed at a barbell. In a squat, you need to attack the bottom position and make it sharp. In a press, you need to attack the bar at the beginning and try to make the entire rep fast. In the bench, you need explode off of your chest. In the Olympic lifts, you have to rip through the second pull <em>as hard as you can</em>. You should be applying the maximum amount of force possible at that moment. I hardly see recreational lifters actively attacking their reps.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a learning curve to attacking the bar — you have to be consistent with your technique. Yet, there’s a difference in mindset when you walk a bar out and think, “Man, this feels heavy, I hope we get it…here we go…” and actively wanting to hit the rep and repeating “Bounce” in your head. Hoping to get a rep and punching it in the fucking mouth are two different things.</p>
<p>Don’t sacrifice technique for the sake of intensity. When most inexperienced lifters think “bounce”, they fall into the squat, lose tightness, kill the bounce, and have a bitch of a rep. The person that attacks his squats the best is my friend AC; he maintains proper tempo and tightness in the descent but attacks the SHIT out of the bounce. This video is two years old, but you can see how he rips through the bottom of the squat — particularly on the second rep.</p>

<p>Lift angry and attack the critical part of your reps. You need to volitionally hit the rep <em>as hard as you can</em>. If there was any question to how hard you hit it, then it wasn’t hard enough. Punch through the rep and lift angry.</p>

  <p>In a perfect world you could completely commit to training and devote every aspect of your life to improve you’re training. Alas! You aren’t special and don’t get paid to perform and compete (I know this realization is hard to understand). Instead, you might have a job, have to study for exams, or have to help wipe your child’s bum. Whatever the case, it may cut into your training and learning how to work around that is important.</p>
<p><strong>Stress The Whole Body</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t had regular access to a gym or a repeating schedule for quite a while (probably six months), yet I’ve gotten a bit bigger, a lot stronger, and rehabbed back from a gnarly hip injury. The key with shoddy scheduling is to train the entire body when finally getting access to a gym.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you hit every lift you can think of, but emulate what most linear progressions consist of: a squat, a press, and a pull. Some days I have just sn/cj while other days I’ve sn, cj, squat, pressed, curls, and did RDLs. One day I squatted, rowed, and did RDLs (with no press movement). I’ve benched, squatted, did RDLs, and weighted pull-ups. Each week I try to bench and press once each, squat and RDLs at least once, and dabble in various assistance (at least once each of rowing, curling, weighted pull-ups, and round back extension). The point is that each day has lifts that use a lot of muscle mass and work on the structures that make the body strong: hips, back, legs, and shoulders. If your schedule is shoddy, aim to perform some of the basic lifts a minimum amount of times throughout the week. This will save you from having to figure it out each time you step in the gym.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/09/images.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5373" data-permalink="/blog/2011/09/my-body-is-ready/images/" data-orig-file="/2011/09/images.jpg" data-orig-size="225,224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="images" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/09/images.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/09/images.jpg" src="/2011/09/images.jpg" alt="" title="images" width="225" height="224" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5373" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Don’t Wreck Yourself</strong></p>
<p>When you do finally get to train, don’t be a wise guy. You wouldn’t want your lifting exposure to give you crippling soreness. Ease into heavier weight over time, be patient, and don’t aim to PR every day. Save the most stressful lifts, like deadlift, for the end of your training week (if you know when you’ll get to the gym again). Don’t hesitate to work in RDLs or round back extensions in its stead; these exercises can help augment the deadlift when you finally get the time to focus on it again.</p>
<p><strong>Know When To Back Off</strong></p>
<p>Just because you finally get to train doesn’t mean your body is ready. When I was in Australia, I only trained twice: the first day felt really shitty (I squatted, pressed, and did pull-ups), then the second day I matched a PR on snatch and came close on clean and jerk. However, if my body wasn’t ready on day two, then I would have just done some sets across instead of pushing the weight.</p>
<p>Recently I tried to snatch when I wasn’t feeling that great. Maybe it’s because I squatted and did RDLs two days before, but I just wasn’t feeling it that day. I ended up missing simple snatches to the point where I audibly said “Fuck this,” and left to go bench. Then my first set at a regularly easy weight on bench was difficult; I racked it after the first rep and was all pissed off. I declared that I was done training for the day and just did some DB rows and dips. My body was not ready.</p>
<p>Ease back the training session if you aren’t feeling great. You can do this by changing the exercises (remember the “<a href="/blog/2011/08/when-in-doubt/" target="_blank">When in doubt, train your back</a>” post?) or reducing the volume and load of your intended workout.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain Mobility</strong></p>
<p>Some times the limiting factor is the body being all wound up from sitting at a desk, in a car, or on an airplane. If you have a good habit of working on your mobility on a daily basis, then these events won’t smash you as hard. Take care to do extra mobility work when you have been in any crappy position for a long time. “Crappy position” would imply that your knees and hips are bent and you are slouching forward. You can’t train well if you aren’t pliable enough to go through a ROM properly.</p>

  <p>On <a href="/blog/2011/08/getting-girls-to-train/">August 15th</a> I talked about how to program for a girl who is getting into a lifting program with no lifting history. There was a slight stink made about creating “special programs” for females and how they should just do the same program a guy would use. This was particularly amusing since <a href="/blog/2011/08/women-and-training/">the week before</a> women were welcomed to voice their opinion on the transition from conventional fitness training to more of a “strength and conditioning program”; their opinions formulated the basis of this series on “Getting Girls to Train”.</p>
<p>&lt;br/. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the majority of girls who actually &ldquo;work out&rdquo; in the world are still unfamiliar with proper training techniques. And &ldquo;in the world&rdquo; is literal: my Australian mates still ask about getting girls to train with them (Australian girls also fear the &ldquo;bulk monster&rdquo;). Getting them involved in some kind of way is better than no involvement and it can act as the gateway for a heightened zeal for strength training.</p>
<p>One confusing concept to most girls will probably be that “cardio” isn’t necessary (see my friend Ellee’s <a href="/blog/2011/04/confessions/" target="_blank">post on this</a>). “Cardio” implies that a machine is used for at least 20 minutes of <a href="http://youtu.be/fp-j72ALHHs?t=9s">self-hating Cinnabon dreaming</a>. Low intensity cardio, (AKA long slow distance, or LSD) doesn’t have any kind of significant systemic stress for improved endurance (or ‘conditioning’) nor does it have any muscular stress whatsoever. Girls trying to develop toned, tight muscles, are merely sweating a little bit and not doing anything to affect their body fat or lean body mass (Remember: sweating is not an indicator of a good exercise stress).</p>

<p>Lifting creates a significant systemic stress that increases metabolic activity in order to recover from. That just means that more energy is used in recovery compared to doing LSD since there isn’t anything to recover from in LSD training. And it’s not just higher energy levels; there is a unique hormonal response that helps reduce body fat. I’ve never had a female gain body fat when doing a linear progression strength program, and the girls that I did do a body fat test on lost body fat (a pinch test with a good caliper and experienced pincher is the only relevant body fat estimate without a Bod Pod, DEXA, or hydrostatic weighing). Cardio is as useless as a Dothraki at sea.</p>
<p>However, after years of elliptical slavery, it’s hard to say no to monotonous leg pumping and wiping sweat with a towel (it proves you were actually sweating). Lettuce be real tea, there’s no reason we have to chain a girl to the barbell rack. Mocking slavery and then becoming a slave driver is just hypocritical, so let’s have new female trainees do cardio proper-like.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheFITBook" target="_blank">FIT</a> explains why endurance training done with intensity is more effective and plenty of examples of how to program it with strength training. Here is an incredibly simple program to use for a girl who is leaving the shadowy cardio cave and stepping into the light of effective training:</p>
<p><strong>Day A</strong></p>
<p>Press</p>
<p>Squat</p>
<p>Back extension</p>
<p><em>Tabata stationary cycle</em></p>
<p><strong>Day B</strong></p>
<p>Bench</p>
<p>RDL</p>
<p>Assisted Pull-up machine</p>
<p><em>30/30 Running Interval</em></p>
<p><em>30/30 implies 30 seconds of running followed by 30 seconds of rest. The speed should be more challenging than a mere yog.</em></p>
<p>This set up could be alternated two to four times a week, although three would be optimal. Instead of just writing in “high intensity endurance training”, I actually filled in the conditioning portion with examples. There are two larger barbell movements in each day, then a useful assistance exercise, then an intensity-based endurance workout. The resistance for the bike and speed on the treadmill could be increased slowly over time to increase the stress and fitness. This little program would develop the legs, ass, and arms, but also provide a good foundation of strength to shift into a more serious strength program <em>if the girl wants to</em>. Most girls, especially the new ones, need to keep in mind that these “developments” or “changes” are going to be subtle, particularly the muscle-related changes. Girls don’t grow muscle very quickly, and they aren’t going to accidentally get mega jacked. The primary problem is the image they have in their head of what is healthy or sexy, so let’s continue using Erin Stern as the “this is what a healthy woman looks like” image.</p>
<p>The lifting and inclusion of higher intensity “cardio” will also help drop body fat…if she eats right. And eating for the beginning female trainee is the subject of next Monday’s post (it will actually be next week too).</p>
