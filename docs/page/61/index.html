  <p>Thursday I went to Judo class with Gant and got to see my buddy <a href="/blog/2010/06/you-are-not-a-beautiful-and-unique-snowflake/">Devin</a> again. I started training Devin to get stronger when he was 12 years old, 6 feet tall, and weighed 200 pounds. Now he’s 14, is 6’4″, and weighs 220 pounds. I worked with him during last night’s class and we threw each other around for a couple of hours. It’s very humbling to have a 14-year-old man-handle you. Here’s a video we recorded a little over a year ago. Devin is 12 here (updated videos will come soon).</p>

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTF5pXT_XOs" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Of course I regret not getting involved with Judo more when I lived in Wichita Falls. I’ve always been very interested in using the physical attributes built in the gym into athletic endeavors. Personally, I haven’t been involved in a sport that requires athleticism, reaction, and finesse in quite a while. Learning new things is a humbling experience, and it’s something I encourage you all to do.</p>
<p>Lifting may be a new activity to you, yet I hope it’s your gateway to other things as well. I grew up loving weight training, but it was <a href="http://youtu.be/glUf4PQ-vuU?t=7s">a means to an end</a> regarding football preparation. I’ve been involved with competing in weightlifting (including Senior Nationals) and coaching powerlifting (including USAPL Raw Nationals twice), but sports and activities that require more are very interesting. In lifting, the same motions are repeated over and over, and there isn’t an exceptional amount of athletic ability inherent in it. This, of course, isn’t a knock on lifting. I love lifting and will always include it in my training, but using the strength and power developed through lifting into another sport is just as rewarding (if not more) as competing in the barbell sports alone.</p>
<p>Some of you are merely strength training enthusiasts. Others of you aim to remain more capable than the average person and want to preserve your health. Some of you may have picked and fully committed to powerlifting and weightlifting. Objectively, only a small percentage of you will be competitive at a high level that would require long-term specialization. In the same way that I encourage you to enter your first lifting meet, I encourage you to try a new sport or activity and even compete in it.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine anything more vulnerable than agreeing to do a Judo tournament in two months from now. I’ve had one session of getting my ass kicked by a young international competitor, and the thought of doing it live against an opponent who has their shit together is intimidating. But that’s the point. Competition isn’t supposed to make you feel nice; for the majority of us it’s going to be a character building experience.</p>
<p>Trying a martial art like Judo can be rewarding in many ways. You will improve your coordination, agility, and body awareness while improving your ability to throw someone through a table when necessary (it often is). Gant once rhetorically asked me, “What’s the point of being strong if you can’t throw someone across the room?” If you can find a place where you can also get some quality striking/sparring and actual real world self defense, then you’re automatically more useful. Being strong doesn’t make you more useful — conditioning your body to utilize that strength is what makes you useful.</p>
<p><strong>Happy PR Friday</strong> — Post your training updates and PRs to the comments. Ask questions about or discuss some other sports to get involved with. If you have questions on Judo (including where to go and how to get started), put them in the comments and I can get some resources to you from Gant.</p>
<p>Follow the jump for a video from last night.</p>

  <p>I just wanted to give some shout outs to some guys that were at the meet this last weekend. For those of you who don’t know, this year’s USAPL Raw Nationals drew an impressive crowd because the top lifters from this meet would be selected for the Raw World Championships next year in Sweden.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Tuchscherer</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t think that you guys haven’t heard of Mike by now, but we’ve always watched his videos at 70’s Big. He runs <a href="http://reactivetrainingsystems.com/">Reactive Training Systems</a>, is an officer in the Air Force, and is a really nice guy. We briefly met him, but I didn’t really want to bother him with the meet going on. He did very well in the 125kg/275lbs weight class weighing in at 120.2kg (120 is the new weight class with “super heavies” being 120+, so he wanted to get experience there). You can read his meet recap <a href="http://www.reactivetrainingsystems.com/blogs/view-blogs/userblog/63">here</a>, and this video is what he did one week out:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YoqlHkOsAs" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>I’m sure there is plenty to learn from him.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Nolan</strong></p>
<p>Matt has been posting as “NolanPower” on the site for quite a while, and is a friggin’ awesomely strong 100kg/220lbs lifter. I’m not the most experienced powerlifting coach/handler, and it was Matt who encouraged me to use the “last warm-up on the platform” method that I implement at meets. More importantly, he was in a tight race all day in the 100kg class. After <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CX7gBNWWy4">squatting 573</a> (his first PR since some time in 2010) and benching 380, the competition was TIGHT going into the deadlift. This of course didn’t stop him from talking to Brent and I about RTS games (not Mike T’s website, but real time strategy games) in between sessions. Anyway, it all came down to his third and final pull; it was either hit it and win, or miss it and walk away with second place. Honestly, this was the most entertaining lift I’ve ever seen — maybe it’s because Matt posts on the site, maybe because he’s just a real nice guy, and maybe it had something to do with the do or die situation. Here is some footage I took of the lift and seeing him immediately after the pull. Nice job, Matt.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDDsLcHAr9g" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>It also looks like Matt will be keeping a training log on RTS <a href="http://www.reactivetrainingsystems.com/blogs/view-blogs/userblog/790">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ettore Ewen</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t any footage of this fella on YouTube…under this name. He is also known as <a href="http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/Ettore_Ewen">Big E. Langston</a> in the WWE stable in Florida. I can’t explain to you guys how big this former Iowa football player is. He’s about as tall as me, but 135kg/297lbs of fucking <a href="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110326143328/prowrestling/images/thumb/b/be/Big_E._Langston.jpg/200px-Big_E._Langston.jpg">yoke</a>. He is absolutely massive. When he walked in the room, Chris just stared and said quietly, “That guy is JACKED.” He won the super heavy class and benched an easy 240kg/529lbs. I watched the second attempt at 512…he fucking killed it like it was me doing 225. I’ve never seen anyone that big in person before. He looked bigger than he does in this video:</p>
<p><em>Edit: I posted the wrong video (he got one hit in and lost the match). Here is the other one I watched that shows more of his strength):</em></p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vVM8InSl1NI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>He also had a shirt that said, “I got 99 problems, but my bench ain’t one of them.” He was pretty badass.</p>
<p>There were lots of other good folk, like the girls from <a href="http://www.prettypowerlifting.com/Welcome.html">Pretty Powerlifting</a> and some other guys that hung out on Saturday night, so it was good fun. Nationals meets can be long, tiring, sometimes boring, but there were really good people and excellent lifters.</p>

<p>Remember when <a href="/blog/2011/08/fit-is-coming/">we talked about</a> the upcoming book, FIT by Dr. Lon Kilgore, Dr. Michael Hartman, and myself? Well that book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497063?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=docthart-20&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393177&amp;creativeASIN=0615497063&amp;ref_=zg_bs_16640_3">now available</a>.</p>
<p>I already gave you the the overview of the information in FIT <a href="/blog/2011/08/fit-is-coming/">in the last post</a>, so instead we’ll talk about plainly today. This book is legit. I’m not just saying that because my name is on the cover, but I’ll point out that if the book sucked, then I wouldn’t want my name on the cover. This book is what the fitness industry needs. I hope that over time we can help influence effective training in the fitness realm in the same way as the strength/conditioning realm. That basically means tweaking the fundamentals of strength and conditioning and applying it to general fitness — and that’s what this book does.</p>
<p>A person with any level of advancement can pick this book up and benefit from it. Personally, I benefited from the strength, endurance, and mobility chapters (written by the other two fellas with PhDs). As most of you know, I have a keen interest in programming, and when we started this project in late 2010, this book enhanced my horizon on programming. It also made me develop the lessons that I’ve learned over time into simple, direct methods and progressions to implement.</p>
<p>This book can help the way you think about training, about programming, about applying stress, and improving ability regardless of what your true intentions are. And it does so without breaking down your body and causing injury. Whether you’re a combat veteran, aiming to get strong, or a sedentary person looking to start a new path to fitness, this book is for you. I sincerely give it all the support in the world and know it won’t let you down.</p>

  <p>We all flew into DFW last night, and everyone but Brent rode up to Wichita falls and got in bed close to 4 AM (hence the late post). This year only Chris, Mike, and Alex competed at nationals. Brent pulled his hamstring a week out (yet still attended) and AC didn’t get his application sent in on time. If you’ve followed the site or the training logs, you know this is an…interesting experience when we are all in the same place. See <a href="/shrugthug/">Brent’s post</a> for some specifics. Here’s the cut and dry performance with what each guy needs to work on in in their program.</p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Brent went 0/0 and scored really high on the “leave it, rather than take it” scale. He is still yet to beat the SC2 campaign, and allegedly has officially retired from competition…mostly because he hates traveling and sleeping on the floor in a room with Mike and Chris. We actually got our own room on Sunday night so we didn’t kill ourselves. We also sat together on the first flight leaving Scranton. Here’s a pic that I texted Chris followed by his response:</p>

<p>Chris was crammed in a seat that was by itself on one side of the plane. From the back of the plane (where Brent and I were) you could see his back hanging out into the aisle. It’s fine.</p>

  </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Alex</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]Alex is Mike’s brother and played football for four years at Plymouth State. He has very good structure and potential. He competed at 110kg/242lbs and was about 248 the day before. We had to use some cutting techniques to get him down, and he weighed in about a pound under. Right now Alex is a stronger squatter than deadlifter, and he went 3/3 and hit an excellent 584 on his third attempt. At that point, I think he was third in the weight class. Alex is a pretty good bencher given his limited experience in powerlifting — recently he hit a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTrAlNWDUn8">touch-and-go 405</a> — yet he needs work on the pause. He hit a pretty simple 369 on the second attempt, but missed 380 when the bar shifted down (towards his waist) off the chest. I probably should have gave him a 2.5 kilo jump to 375 lbs, but his goal was 380. Lastly, on deadlift, he hit a smooth 534 on his third attempt for an overall 20 pound PR (he pulled a real shitty looking 520 a month ago or so). Overall, Alex did really well in only his second meet going 8/9 and getting two big PRs on squat and deadlift (with a meet PR on bench). Not to mention that most of his training occurred while he went through and graduated from a fire fighter academy these last few months.</p>
<p>Alex mainly will be developing his deadlift (which looked really solid at the meet, better than in training) as well as getting more experience with the paused bench.[/spoiler]</p>

<p><strong>Mike</strong></p>
<p><em>Edit: Here is <a href="/mike/2011/08/23/not-really-impressed/">Mike’s recap</a>. He references the ideas I had the other day for his programming based on our breakdown after the meet.</em></p>
<p>[spoiler]Mike historically has pretty good meets where we have a solid, meticulous plan and execute it. We normally go at least 8/9 and PR on pretty much everything, yet this meet had some more downs than ups. This is mostly due to the fact that every six months he has to cut weight to get his waist circumference within regs for his PT test, and having a short, thick torso doesn’t help. In the last month mike gained about…30 pounds since his PT test (he competed in the 125kg/275lbs class). We opened with 540 on squat, which Mike hit, but looked slow in and out of the bottom. That worried me, so I emphasized bouncing the shit out of his second attempt at 556, a weight that was lower than what we originally planned. Mike was much sharper and made this meet PR look much better than the opener, although he didn’t crush it. Then I made a 7.5 kg jump to 573 (our high-end plan was going to be closer to 584). Mike descended slow despite me emphasizing needing to bounce the fuck out of it (he said it felt heavy), and had a slow in-and-out of the hole just like on the opener. However, he ground the fucker out and made the rep. After racking it, he was 2-1 red lights: no lift because of depth. We don’t have good video of this lift, yet the middle judge gave a red light for depth, which I thought was very odd. Mike has a weird shaped body with long, thick femurs and a big ass, so it would be easy to perceive him high. I saw his right side (the red lighted side) and he looked deep to me, but the judges don’t overturn lifts red-lighted because of depth.</p>
<p>We took an opener at 303 on bench — a meet PR that has alluded Mike for some time, including Military Nationals earlier this year (our method of programming has worked well for him) — and he smoked it. But wait, it was a mis-load and only 297. I decided to re-take the lift at the end of the round at the weight we actually called for instead of accepting it as our opener. Mike then hit 303 plainly after asking “We good?” to the loaders (his opening bench was mis-loaded last year at nationals too), but had to follow himself because his second attempt was the lowest in his flight (he hates this, so don’t mention it). He had a 4 minute clock after the bar was loaded, and hit an easy 314 on a second attempt that I stepped in to side spot since the loaders went to get a snack during the 4 minute clock. We then made a small jump for 319 on the third and he went 3/3 on bench for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>We took Mike’s last warm-up on the platform for deadlift at 545 which was obviously easy. Then we hit the intermediary jump at 595 on his second (about 10 pounds below his meet PR) which, like always, came off the floor fast, but then was locked out a bit slow (remember the long femurs?). I would have given him something like 617 for his third, yet we needed 628 to get a 1500 total. I put the pressure on Mike to make the lift, and it came off the floor fast and then…pretty much stalled at his lower thigh. It was too much to lock out that day.</p>
<p>We’ll be aiming to continue developing Mike’s bench (his weakest lift) with some more frequency throughout the week and we’ll be working on his lumbar/hamstring integrity with heavy pulls by using rack pulls more efficiently. I’m also going to shift him into using speed squats along with heavy squatting in the programming (more on this soon). [/spoiler]</p>

<p>Chris’ meet was mixed — it could have been better, but it could have been much worse. He weighed in close to 300 pounds (his heaviest yet) and competed as a super heavy. We had to warm up kinda fast on squat, and he was sweating his ass off and huffing and puffing in the warm-up room. It wasn’t like he had to hit several attempts within a short span, but it was faster than he needed to. I thought he’d be ready, but his opener at 622 was slow — which is very strange for Chris who is a strong squatter. I should have called for a lighter second attempt, but I figured that with more rest before the second attempt and emphasizing bouncing the rep that he’d be able to stick to the plan on squat and called for 644 — something he hit in his last meet on a third attempt. Chris missed 644 — it was just too heavy. I blame myself: I think I tapered him a little to early, warmed up a little too fast, and most importantly we had to travel to get to this meet (including a 12 hour delay at the Newark airport on Friday for Chris). We decided to wave the third because Chris said, “In training, if I don’t have it that day, I just don’t have it.” We conserved energy for the rest of the meet. This is a tight spot for a coach, especially with an anxious lifter like Chris. I had to get his attention, and pretty much say, “I know you’re pissed and upset about squat, but we still have the rest of the meet. It’s time to step up and be a competitor — we can worry about squat later, but let’s put all our focus into getting good reps on the bench and deadlift. Go take a walk and let it go on the walk. When you come back, let’s fucking have fun and compete.” To Chris’ credit, that’s exactly what he did, went on a two minute walk, and came back as the fun loving, Rated R kinda guy he is.</p>
<p>However he mis-heard me when I said “work up to 275 on bench and I’ll be right back” — I had Mike and Chris lifting on two different platforms and was managing both of them. When Chris was about 4 out, I went back and saw that he had only done 225 a second ago. He normally would go 275, 315, and 330 before opening at 352, but we only had time for the 275 and 315, and had to go straight to the comp platform after 315. Again, this is my fault. I made sure to use up as much as the clock as possible and sent him to the bench with about 25 seconds left. You’re supposed to get the “start” command before time runs out, and he was fucking around with his set up and got the “start” command with literally one second left — I was so close to shitting my pants. Chris isn’t a great bencher because of a shoulder injury he got while weightlifting; it had been bothering him in the past few weeks. We wanted to hit around 380, which he’s done in training, but I was more concerned with building his confidence after the squat fiasco. We took a simple 363 on the second to tie a meet PR, and then a hard 374 on the third attempt to set a meet PR. 3/3 and feeling good, as evidenced by him flexing his pecs and yelling “COME ON, DO IT NOW, KILL ME” when warming up for deadlift.</p>
<p>We took the last warm-up of 584 on the platform, which was easy. Then we took the intermediate jump of 628 on the second; it wasn’t slow, but it wasn’t as fast as I wanted. Our high-end plan was to hit 675 or 680 on deadlift (he hit a pretty simple 665 about 5 weeks ago), yet after seeing the second, I decided to lower it a bit to give him more of a chance on getting it (also, a few minutes prior, Mike had missed his third deadlift on the other platform and I didn’t want Chris to miss his). I gave him 666 — the devil’s number and told him to summon the demons. I just got goose bumps thinking about this pull — it was a battle the whole way but he never even thought to give up on it. He had to grind through every inch of the lift past his knees, up his thighs, and to the lockout, but locked it out while everyone in the area yelled at the top of their lungs. Chris is nothing if not a fighter. Then he walked in the back and said to Brent, “Double overhand? Nah, I’m good.” since he pulls with a double overhand hook grip. Chris placed 4th overall behind some big mother fuckers.</p>
<p>We’ve been joking around that Chris has been SPF (a fed that has a 308 weight class) since he was over 300 the other day. He’s always told me he’s wanted to be a 275 lifter, and we’re gonna put him on a program and gradual diet plan to drop some body fat off and maintain strength for a couple months. I’m also going to emphasize mobbing his dinged up shoulder, tweak his bench programming, and probably transition him into a more advanced type of program by the end of the year, although it’ll depend on his body fat/weight.[/spoiler]</p>

  <p>In the time that I’ve had this website, I’ve been fortunate enough to meet a lot of great people through the internet or in person. Some of you have become my good friends like Al, Tom, Hom, <a href="http://crossfitmonterey.wordpress.com/">Jacob</a>, Briskin, Ben, and Saul and Becky. I’ve also met a lot of awesome people doing the workshops:</p>
<p><strong>Chicago</strong> – Ellee, Cori, Doogie, Cory, and Jay</p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong> – My bicepped studs Paul and Chris (with their better halves), Rowan, and Mark</p>
<p><strong>Monterey</strong> – Gabe, Nate, Mariah, Bill, Elliott, Harj, and Robin</p>
<p><strong>Australia</strong> – <a href="http://shirespeedandstrength.com.au/">Pete</a> (top fucking bloke), <a href="http://warriorperformance.com.au/">Shannon</a> (another top bloke), Harvey (awesome dude — see the trend?), Shane (both of them), Stuart — and all of you other fuckers. You guys were all great.</p>
<p>And that’s just from the past few months. There’s all kinds of great people like <a href="http://www.crossfitintrepid.com/">Ruth and Sean</a> (power couple), Marcus, and Avelyn from CF Intrepid; Lisa in Santa Monica; Ryan Huseman and the Coffman’s at <a href="http://www.crossfitama.com/trainers/">CF Amarillo</a>; Ian and Allison at <a href="http://www.crossfitcenturion.com/">CF Centurion</a>. And of course I’ve got homeys like Jacob Cloud, Kittensmash, and Brian who I actually need to meet to prove you aren’t just mouth breathers on the computer (like Tom is). Then there’s a lot of you I interact with in the comments and in the chat room — you all are too numerous to name.</p>

<p>Lastly there are all of you who are watchers on the wall, never posting but quietly observing. When I meet you guys you always say, “Yeah, I read the site all the time, but never post.” Ah, that’s fine, but I welcome you to interact with all of us all the same. The interaction in this community is one of the best parts about running this site. We’ve managed to learn from each other, remain open to new ideas, accept newcomers, and encourage new lifters. Some of you have gone to meets, gotten stronger, or gotten better. Even though I don’t put up every e-mail that says, “Hey, you really helped me do this, thank you,” it makes it all worth it. It makes me sheepishly smile when some dude says they had a great fucking time at their first meet. The site started to help people with their training and I hope it’s done that for you, regardless of the amount of impact.</p>
<p>This site attracts the most fantastic and nicest people I’ve met in my life and if I believed in silly shit like luck and fate, I’d almost think I was lucky. 70’s Big thrives because you guys are here. My only complaint is that I can’t have a grand 70’s Big gathering to do a whole lot of ridiculous training, meat eating (earmuffs), and ale drinking (or can we…?). In any case, I appreciate all of you. In a hetero way.</p>
<p>I also like seeing your updates and PRs in the comments on <strong>PR Friday</strong> (which is today). I do read every comment that comes on this site, and I remember more of you than I should. I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. In any case, gg. See you out there.</p>
<p><strong>USAPL Raw Nationals</strong></p>
<p>is this weekend in Scranton, PA. Chris, Mike, Alex, Brent, and I will be there. Brent won’t be lifting because of a recent hamstring injury. Brent and I will be training (i.e. making our lats sing) somewhere on Saturday, so if you have any recommendations let us know here, the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig">fan page</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig">twitter</a> (the latter will show up on my phone).</p>

  <p>I remember reading an old article in Iron Mind — maybe it was by John McCallum, but it could have been Ken Leistner — about being young, training hard, and eating big. The author talked about how they would work during the day, train in the evening, then head over to a local diner to eat cheese burgers and milk shakes. He also discussed how they made weight gaining shakes with milk, cream, chocolate syrup, and protein supplements. It’s such a glorious concept; eating what society calls junk food and getting big and strong.</p>
<p>But lettuce be real tea, this won’t last forever. Either you won’t stay 19 forever or you’ll end up chubby. If you think that being marginally stronger and plenty more fat is worth it, that’s fine, but <a href="http://youtu.be/KBHu_wi5FaI?t=4m58s">let’s get serious</a>. The percentage of professional athletes and world contendors (who might sacrifice body weight for performance) I know is pretty low; everyone else owes it to themselves to not be sloppy-fat for pride and health reasons. “But what about guys like Paul Anderson?” If you were Paul Anderson (or any other strong-fat guy) you would have fucking known it by now. It’s okay to say, “I want to look good/better/great and still be strong.” Really, it isn’t a big deal. Anyone making a big deal about it inherently doesn’t care about what you want out of your training.</p>
<p>The other day someone asked what their numbers needed to be in order to “dial in” their diet. Much like there is no strength requirement to advance, there is no absolute number to get to before making better food choices. Just becuase food quality increases doesn’t mean the macros or calories have to decrease. Eating high caloric food is easy because it’s readily available. As Johnny Pain’s e-book SWOLE points out, it takes effort to eat better and still make good mass gains.</p>

<p>I’m not a zealot about anything nor am I a diet groupie. Different types of people will require different things, yet it will typically funnel into some basic concepts. If I had to say my ‘nutrition methodology’ revolves around an existing diet, it would side loosely with the Paleolithic Diet. The food choices in a Paleo set up are of the highest quality, meat is aplenty, fat intake is high, and carbs aren’t superfluous. I see it as the end goal for most people to shift into to age with; it just makes sense that eating the most nutrient dense food sources and eliminating synthetic chemicals would yield optimal health. However, I don’t hardline the rules like a zealot and am okay with having leeway. I don’t support whining about feeling sick after eating some ice cream or making a group of people change their dinner plans because you’re frightened over the potential gluten exposure. And when training hard, you’ll sometimes need something more than what a caveman scrounged up for his hairy wife.</p>
<p>But what’s more important than the end product are the steps that are taken to get there. In all the time I’ve been training people, eating seems to be the hardest habit to change, and the fatter the person, the worse it is. People who can make heaps of changes all at once are rare, and instead I recommend that most go through phases. These phases should be followed until their contents become habit. As always, it’s variable based on the person, but I tried organizing it logically. Don’t fucking spend a lot of time worrying and analyzing the order of everything; look at the general trend over time from simple to more complex.</p>
<p><strong>Phase I</strong></p>
<p>– Stop eating processed food (condiments still fine, yogurt fine)</p>
<p>– Stop soda</p>
<p>– Limit milk (or drop it completely if you’re fat)</p>
<p><strong>Phase II</strong></p>
<p>– Cook more meat</p>
<p>– Improve the quality of carbohydrates (single-ingredient sources like oats, rice, whole grain stuff along with obvious tubers/fruit/veggie)</p>
<p>– Increase water intake</p>
<p><strong>Phase III</strong></p>
<p>– Increase fat intake (good oils, nuts, cream, butter, etc.)</p>
<p>– Get consistent with eating times</p>
<p>– Time food intake with respect to training</p>
<p><strong>Phase IV</strong></p>
<p>– Reduce the less natural carbs (like rice and noodles) and get them primarily from tubers, fruits, veggies</p>
<p>– Stop eating chemical sweeteners</p>
<p><strong>Phase V</strong></p>
<p>– Adjust macros for goals (long-term)</p>
<p>– Learn to adjust macros for body fat and weight changes (short-term)</p>
<p><strong>Phase VI</strong></p>
<p>– Tweak specifics for health (e.g. lowering carbs, sodium or fructose to decrease blood pressure)</p>
<p>That’s kind of a lot of stuff, huh? Sure it is. And you’re not going to be able to handle it all right now, so stop worrying about it. Instead, use a progression like I laid out here. If you’re thinking, “Oh shit, what is my blood pressure? What if it’s high?” and you haven’t even stopped eating packaged bullshit foods, then you clearly need to clean things up. Worrying about being fat while still drinking soda should be a no-brainer. That’s like worrying about pleasing a woman in bed when you haven’t even talked to her yet.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the phases above not only represent general progressions over time, but they aren’t hardlined. For example, let’s say I’m cleaning up my carb sources. Does that mean I never have a hamburger? Fuck no, I’m a bacon cheeseburger connosieur (I’ve eaten 14 in a 5 day period), but I’m not going to eat one every day.</p>
<p>Again, some of these will be more important for certain people. I know how to eat something different to increase my body weight or decrease my body fat. This might be relevant to a military personnel or some dude who is adjusting his body fat. Either way, it’s going to be easier once the basics are taken care. Taking care of the basics and using a good training program will typicall result in a person with decent amounts of musculature and body fat. Having a better diet, more muscle mass, and less body fat are all individual markers of an improved metabolism; in other words they augment the body’s ability to perform more efficiently and reduce fat.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of you who need to read stuff like this to actually start making a change, so hopefully it acts as a catalyst of improvement.</p>

  <p>There’s been plenty of discussion lately. Now let’s just view things. I promise you won’t be disappointed in this post.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Frazetta</strong> was an American fantasy and science fiction artist who painted <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=frank+frazetta&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1333&amp;bih=609">awesome pieces</a>. Frazetta’s interpretation of <a href="http://arrestedmotion.com/2010/07/frankfrazetta-conan-the-destroyer-1971.jpg">Conan</a> launched his career and subsequently changed how artists portrayed fantasy/sci-fi forever. <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/05/frank-frazetta">Here</a> is a good piece I found on Frazetta’s ability. Both Rippetoe and Kilgore are big fans of Frazetta, and I first saw my favorite piece of Frazetta’s hanging up in Rip’s house:</p>

<p><strong>Sharpwriter</strong> is an American deviant artist that I just found recently (thanks to Justin’s*** link). When you look at his pictures, make sure and click them to increase the size because has incredible detail. He seems to enjoy combining different concepts into one image (like a <a href="http://sharpwriter.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d2dbjnc">cyborg viking</a>) as well as doing his rendition of popular characters (like <a href="http://sharpwriter.deviantart.com/art/JOKER-WizardWorl-133182093?q=gallery%3Asharpwriter%2F179817&amp;qo=55">The Joker</a>, <a href="http://sharpwriter.deviantart.com/art/Bebop-197708923?q=gallery%3Asharpwriter%2F179817&amp;qo=11">Bepop</a>, and <a href="http://sharpwriter.deviantart.com/art/RockSteady-178368128?q=gallery%3Asharpwriter%2F179817&amp;qo=24">Rocksteady</a>). I more so want to point out these patriotic pieces:</p>

<p>Which picture is your favorite? I think Frazetta’s images are much more 70’s Big than Sharpwriter’s (I think Dr. Kilgore told me Frazetta studied anatomy so that he’d improve on his ability to paint musculature), but Sharpwriter’s detail is amazing. What other fantasy/sci-fi artists compare to these guys?</p>

  <p><em>My friend Shawn wrote this little tidbit for the site because he thought it was interesting. I agree and it’s a good look at daily cost of eating well when training hard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Money Wasted Looking Great</strong></p>
<p>by The Law Dragon</p>
<p>Last night I was doing some budgeting — because my life isn’t a fucking game — and I broke down what it cost me to be a Greek statute incarnate. What I discovered nearly rocked my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiwA3C2qeRo">face off</a>.</p>
<p>Several months ago, I stumbled on a website selling naturally produced, organic meats to bodybuilders (<a href="http://www.eattogrow.com">www.eattogrow.com</a>). I immediately mocked the site and wannabe bodybuilders who bought into this shit solely because some slack-jawed faggot like Jay Cutler endorsed it. But then I realized the benefits – namely the cost efficiency and quality of the products – and ultimately decided I would spring for ordering a months supply of chicken breast*. After ordering the chicken, I ordered my protein powder for the month. After shopping around – I spent as little as I could – and here is what I spent:</p>
<p>$2.08/chicken breast ~ 30g</p>
<p>$1.03/whey shake ~ 50g</p>
<p>$0.10/egg ~ 6g</p>
<p>When I first started working out (not training) with Justin, I ate 6 whole eggs every morning for breakfast. I did this for an entire school year. Now, I fucking hate eggs. You couldn’t pay me to eat 6 in a sitting, but if I did – I would spend about .60 total on protein for that meal – and that would yield 36g of protein.</p>
<p>Assuming that I drink three shakes a day, I would be spending $3.09 on the powder alone – assuming it was with water – and it would yield 150g of protein (note: I bought the 10lb bag). Assuming I eat two chicken breasts in a day, I would spend $4.16 and it would yield about 70g of protein.</p>
<p>In order to ingest 256g of protein in a day (<em>Shawn weighs around 230</em>), I would need to spend around $7.85 a day. This is before any other costs. This is as basic as it comes. This is fucking no frills protein. This doesn’t factor in milk for a shake, cooking costs, or any delicious sauce for your chicken breast for those of you who can’t handle eating unseasoned meat (<em>Shawn regularly eats meat plain because he’s stupid</em>).</p>
<p>For a month’s supply of this most <em>basic</em> protein, you’re going to spend about $235. For your convenience, that’s $2,820 in protein per year. That is of course, not including eating out – no steaks at Outback (Tom), no smoothies at the gym, and no fucking double-meat burritos at Chipotle (which cost $10/burrito).</p>
<p>Now, I know none of you will follow this. Most guys eat out every once in a while. And we all eat at restaurants occasionally too (see what I did there). The point is you’re either (a) not paying for your daily protein consumption, (b) you’re paying a significant amount more than I just outlined above – because you’re eating something more expensive – i.e. steak, fish, lamb, or (c) you aren’t getting enough protein.</p>

<p>In the event you spend less and manage to get higher quality protein, maybe its time to stock being Scrooge with your protein source and share that shit with the rest of us. My point in all of this is that it is one thing to say – ‘I need more than a gram of protein per pound of body weight each day’ and think ‘I can do that y’all!’ But it is something entirely different to say ‘I will spend about $3,000 per year doing this.’ It isn’t that $3,000 is a lot to me, its just that it isn’t being spent on rent, utilities, a cell phone bill, gas, or <strong>saved</strong> or <strong>invested</strong> – it’s being spent on something I’m likely not even going to enjoy ingesting unless I spend more. If you’re financially conscious then use this to think twice next time some chick asks you to go out for ice cream or to get a cup of coffee at Starbucks – you can afford it, but do you really want to waste your hard earned money?</p>
<p>*Although you pay less up front in the store for Perdue/Tyson – you actually get less product. The Perdue I use to purchase was 12-20% broth/stock. Thus, if I bought chicken (normally for $5 on average) I am paying $1 on shit that cooks out. If I get 3 breasts per pack – that’s .33/per breast that is wasted. As I’ve stated, this isn’t a fucking joke – next time you sit down to a chicken breast imagine throwing $0.33 across the room and shouting out, ‘I don’t need it!’ because that’s basically what you’re doing. If you want to be a tough guy and shop at Costco/Sam’s – congratulations, you typically get chicken with more than 20% broth/stock.</p>
<p><em>The protein choices here are pretty lean (especially cause he doesn’t eat a lot of eggs), which may or may not be good for you. Typically more red meat is necessary when you’re trying to gain mass. Let’s ignore his particular choices and instead share what your protein sources are each day. If you know the cost, especially the cost per serving/meal/day/month/year, then share that as well. I’m sure we’ll see some interesting tidbits.</em></p>

  <p>Okay, so you’ve met a girl who is no longer skeptical and is willing to train, but now you need to give her quality advice as she starts a new program. Teaching and coaching are dependent on taking complex concepts and whittle them down to easy-to-implement points of emphasis. I have a few topics that we’ll cover in following “70’s Big Women” posts on Monday. Today’s focuses on setting up the new trainee on a quality program.</p>
<p>I’m not so egotistical that people need to do my exact program, nor am I even going to require that all girls primarily strength train. My only requests are:</p>
<p>– squat twice a week</p>
<p>– bench and press once a week each</p>
<p>– do a horizontal and vertical pulling movement once a week each</p>
<p>– do RDL’s twice a week OR RDL and deadlift once a week each</p>
<p>– cardio (low or high intensity) should be kept to training days or Saturday</p>
<p>I’m not really concerned with deadlifts, especially in the first few months of training. The RDL is a movement that works similar musculature as the deadlift, yet is easier to do and will really help develop the hamstrings. I see so many people doing deadlifts incorrectly — male or female — that having a few months of the lumbar holding its position while the hamstrings do work is going to set them up for success if/when they do start deadlifting. Not to mention the hamstrings will develop a wonderful back side on a girl who hasn’t trained before.</p>
<p>I’m also not concerned with what type of squat she does. Let’s face it, not every girl who is training has access to even a decent coach. Then, the low bar back squat is pretty technical compared to the high bar, so this means there are fewer coaches available to teach this movement well. If she’s shoving her knees out and going down all the way, this is a victory. Making it an easier movement (so she isn’t frustrated) is even better. Besides, the RDL’s compliment high bar squats very well.</p>

<p>The inclusion of benching and pressing is obvious — they help develop strength in the upper body. However, extra care should be taken to not allow the new female trainee to internally rotate and flair the elbows. An “elbows to boobs” cue works very well in both of these cases as it will help keep the elbows in, which is an externally rotated position in the shoulder. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRCI3By2WUA">this video</a> for a more detailed discussion.</p>
<p>The vertical pulling movement implies pull-ups, chin-ups, or some variation of them. Getting girls, especially taller ones, to do a pull-up can be quite a process. Most girls reflect that ‘greasing the groove’ over time is what helps them best. Chicks who are adamant about developing a pull-up can get a doorway pull-up bar and work on it over time by doing partial reps or negatives (controlling from top to bottom). They can aim for a small amount each day, and increase the reps per day each week. The horizontal rowing movement would imply barbell, dumbbell or machine rows. Most girls — especially those who haven’t trained before — will not have developed musculature in their upper back. This lack of strength and musculature can make it difficult to externally rotate and maintain positioning on the presses, keep the chest up on the squat or deadlift, and become a long-term muscle imbalance over time if not addressed. The sooner the upper back musculature gets developed, the less of a limiting factor it will be.</p>
<p>If the girl is intimidated by or too weak for barbells, she could use machines for the two presses and two rowing movements. However, squatting needs to be done with a bar — hopefully her ‘sponsor’ can articulate how her ass won’t be sweet if she is leg pressing. RDL’s can be done easily enough with the fixed barbells located in most globo gyms, but they can also be picked up from the hooks on the outside of a rack. After a month or so of machine work, our new trainee could transition into using barbells.</p>
<p>This kind of set up could have her training two or three times a week, but preferably three. It’s best to have complete rest days to allow the body to recover and adapt to this new stress.This concept is lost on a lot of new trainees (and folks who come from a conditioning-only background), but hopefully the sponsor can explain how the structures and hormones need this day to undergo cellular change and adaptation. If nobody knows what the hell that means (sponsor or trainee), it at least sounds good and is true. This means that non-strength work (like cardio or any derivative of endurance work) should occur on existing training days so that it doesn’t interfere with recovery.</p>
<p>Next Monday we’ll talk about “cardio” and how it applies to the new trainee. For more information on progressions, templates, and programming, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheFITBook">FIT</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>UPDATE: I forgot it was PR Friday — post training records and updates to the comments. Chime in if you don’t have any; it’s good to hear from you guys. And if you’ve never posted before, don’t be scared. Nobody will bite you…hard.</strong></p>
<p>Dmitry Klokov is my favorite weightlifter. Is it because he is my Facebook friend? Is it because he is my Russian speedo bro? Is it because in his reply to my message he put a smiley face emoticon? No, it’s because he’s intense as fuck AND is jacked. I’ve always had a fascination with strength and musculature, and I appreciate when both are represented seamlessly. This is why Doug Young and Anatoly Pisranko are the co-captains of 70’s Big instead of Paul Anderson.</p>
<p>Enter “<a href="http://strengthvillain.com/?wpsc-product=swole-the-greyskull-growth-principles">SWOLE</a>“, an e-book by my friend <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/">Johnny Pain</a>. This book has been out for at least a month, but I wanted to give it my full attention before I reviewed it as I anticipated how much it would help 70’s Big readers. And it doesn’t disappoint.</p>

<p>The theme of this e-book is gaining lean, hard (earmuffs) mass without putting on unnecessary levels of fat (which JP refers to as “getting fat-fucked”). While an excess of calories is needed in order to increase lean body mass, this doesn’t mean it’s necessary to eat pizza and ice cream to do it. It’s never been my intention to get fat nor has it been my recommendation that anyone get fat, yet the early stages of this website put a premium on junk food as a method of accumulating calories to grow (with the secondary message implying that if you get fat, you should modify your diet). Yes, that’s certainly one way of doing it; the easy way. However, it’s possible to steadily but surely increase both strength and musculature without excessive body fat gains to achieve maximum jackage, but it’s the hard way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most common reason that people are unhappy with their body composition, whether in the context of trying to add mass, lose body fat, or attempting to do both at the same time, is that they often lack the kind of accountability for their diet that is necessary to make the changes that they are after. If you want your body to change for the better, you need to be keeping score.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JP spends the obligatory amount of time explaining how getting bigger without ending up like a doughy mess is not only possible, but regularly done in the bodybuilding world. Did you cringe at the end of that last sentence? It’s because fat guys who lift weights and the functional fitness community would lead you to believe the bodybuilding community is narcissistic, gay, stupid, weird, and so on (failing to point out that any community that is large enough is going to include these types of people). In any case, JP does what I do — applies information from other sources into his method of implementation and programming.</p>
<p>The first few chapters discuss the general concepts of the discipline needed to have a good physique developed from a proper diet with quality food (I particularly like the concept of “single-ingredient food choices” AKA real food). In order to gain muscle without looking like a pile of shit, there needs to be a baseline amount of macronutrients that account for the energy your body will normally consume plus some additional amounts to induce growth. Then, when mass gain slows, you add on predetermined “layers” of calories to garner progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s time to get some good information on nutrition and how to build up the body the right way. Be accountable, take responsibility and above all educate yourself about safe sex, because you will be having a lot more of it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the book shifts into implementation by defining what those layers are and how they can be added or removed. I won’t divulge what constitutes the layers (you’ll have to buy the damn thing), but the real genius in JP’s method is creating a really fucking simple way to gauge amounts of food instead of counting grams and measuring out amounts. Then, each additional layer is an equally simple method of increasing the caloric content…by a small amount.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you haven’t gathered by now, the idea of adding things in small increments is one of the most vitally important principles to adding mass without significant body fat accumulation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And therein lies the “magic”. Instead of “eat more to recover, pussy,” there is a carefully created system that will allow a trainee to titrate his food up or down based on his results. It really is an impressive way to eradicate all of the problems associated with eating properly when trying to get swole.</p>
<p>Lastly, JP discusses some very basic ways to gauge progress over time; instead of waiting until there’s a giant belly button and love handles, trainees will collect some simple data points to see if the diet is too much, too little, or just right. The easiest and most profound method is to use regular photos of the body to gauge fat increase — the pics don’t lie.</p>
<p>You’ll notice I’ve used words like “basic”, “simple”, and “easy” throughout this review; JP simplifies the concepts to a manageable diet that even the laziest of guys can implement seamlessly. As with most things that are worth a fuck, the concept is very simple, yet having the discipline to do it is hard. I’ve never met anyone that said, “I want to be really strong and a fat piece of shit!” If you’re worried about the latter, then <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/?wpsc-product=swole-the-greyskull-growth-principles">purchase the book</a> and take control of your body weight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having a Herculean physique (or Apollonian for you bodybuilding history terminology nerds) is something that the overwhelming majority of the earth’s population will never experience. It is truly an extraordinary accomplishment, and therefore requires extraordinary measures. If sucking it up and drinking a gallon of milk a day was all that was nutritionally required in order to add loads of muscle, don’t you think there would be a lot more god-like physiques out there walking around?</p>
