  <p>The strength training (i.e. tough guy) community has scorned running like a bastard child. They take pride in the fact that they can’t shuffle down the street without having a cardiac touting how “gay” it would be if they could. While I’m not recommending that a 250+ pound person needs to be running in the dead of a northern hemisphere summer, but the “running is gay” crowd forgets that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_i6szEMhqk">some of the most badass shit</a> happens <a href="http://youtu.be/bpLtXIlkyYA?t=1m55s">when running</a>.</p>
<p>Most general strength trainees won’t have any kind of fitness test running requirements, nor will they be required to run. However, most general strength trainees aren’t in danger of breaking anything but personal records and could use the capability of running 50 meters really fast if necessary (e.g. chasing a woman with a purse, hunting boar with a knife, or retrieving their dog). Getting winded after a sprint and NOT being on dbol just makes you an asshole. Besides, you should be able to go out and play non-sober softball or rec-league basketball any time you want without achieving crippling soreness.</p>
<p>Recently a reader of this site failed out of a 1.5 mile run in an application fitness test because of horrible shin splints. I want to first explain why shin splints occur, how to prevent them, and suggestions on progressions and technique.</p>
<p><strong>What Causes Shin Splints</strong></p>
<p>The standard technique of running is…no technique.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just think about your own personal history in running, when did you learn to run and did anyone ever actually watch you and teach you how to run efficiently? If someone did, how do you know they taught you correctly? The assumption that one innately knows how to run simply by virtue of being human is not justified or appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>–pg 84 of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheFITBook">FIT</a>, by Kilgore, Hartman, and Lascek</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the advent of the running hobby around the 1960s, shoe manufacturers reflected this interest by producing large, cushioned soles in their shoes to improve instance of injury — it didn’t really work, as there is a conservative report of 3 injuries per 100 hours of running (2,3). In any case, shin splints occur regularly in a trainee when they are unadapted to running — and this was the case in the reader who failed out.</p>
<p>When the initial heel strike occurs, the ankle is in active dorsi-flexion where the toes are pulled up; the opposite (or toes pointed down) is plantar-flexion. It seems odd that you would actively dorsi-flex your ankle, but it occurs; <a href="http://www.iamunscared.com/">Brian Mackenzie</a> shows people this all the time when viewing their slow motion replay. Consider it the byproduct of never being taught efficient technique and utilizing the available foot wear.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/08/heelstrike1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5104" data-permalink="/blog/2011/08/shin-splints/heelstrike-2/" data-orig-file="/2011/08/heelstrike1.jpg" data-orig-size="480,104" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Justin&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1313062837&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="heelstrike" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/08/heelstrike1.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/08/heelstrike1.jpg" src="/2011/08/heelstrike1.jpg" alt="" title="heelstrike" width="480" height="104" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5104" /></a></p>
<p><em>Image from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheFITBook">FIT</a></em></p>
<p>When going through this “heel strike, forefoot flop”, the ankle is moving into plantar-flexion (toe down) while trying to maintain dorsi-flexion (toe up). The resistance of the movement causes the muscles that maintain dorsi-flexion to eccentrically act — they are stretched when still trying to contract. This is the same thing that happens to the hamstrings in an <a href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/">RDL</a>: the hip goes through resisted hip flexion yet the hip extensors (the hamstrings) are resisting the action and preventing you from just falling over. Let’s substitute the terms and focus on the ankle while running: the ankle goes through resisted plantar flexion yet the dorsi-flexors (on the front of the shin) are resisting the action and preventing the foot from just falling forward.</p>
<p>If you paid attention to your muscle mag lore, you know that eccentric muscle action causes the most damage to muscle fibers and as a result more soreness (since the muscle fibers are being ripped apart while trying to stay contracted). The muscle on the front of the shin that cause dorsi-flexion (pulling the toes up) is primarily the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibialis_anterior_muscle">tibialis anterior</a>. When heel striking, it’s going through hundreds of repetitions of damaging eccentric action. The damage occurs along the entire attachment site of the tibialis anterior, which for this muscle is along the entire tibia (shin bone). That’s why it’s called “shin splints” since the entire shin is painful afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>How To Prevent Shin Splints</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people heel strike, but not everyone has shin splints because it’s relatively easy to adapt to. Had our failed reader done a few running workouts prior to the fitness test, he could have lasted the entire workout instead of hobbling off the track halfway through. Merely do a few short distance workouts and progressively increase over time; this is the same principle you would apply to beginning any new activity and something that is discussed in lots of detail in <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheFITBook">FIT</a>.</p>
<p>An example of re-introducing running would be running several regular paced 50m intervals. Notice I didn’t say 15 intervals or 400m; it’s purposely low to allow adaptation. Crippling soreness with new activity is your fault and an indication of lack of care, ignorance, or stupidity. Progressively increase the total amount of work over time (perhaps up to 10 intervals), then increase the distance (100 meter intervals), and then progress into regular distances and intervals (repeats of 200m or 400m). Notice this is all at a regular pace instead of a fast pace; in this case, we’re conditioning the structures instead of the energy system capability. In this simple progression, it’s assumed that the trainee is still heel striking.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying Technique</strong></p>
<p>A complete discussion on efficient running mechanics would leave the scope of this post, yet it revolves around proper balance over center of mass, not heel striking, and running on the fore foot. To learn this technique, I’m partial to my friend <a href="http://crossfitendurance.com">Brian Mackenzie</a>; I have been to his running seminar and he’s a cool dude (and has an awesome pitt bull). The biggest mistakes I see people doing with this are running on the toes (which is too far forward), pointing the toe prior to making contact with the ground (which is probably an equally injurious position to heel striking), trying to extend the hip back (instead of pulling the foot/ankle up), and bouncing up and down (instead of streamlined). Realistically, if you’re interested in proper technique you should find a coach (the easiest way would be to call a CrossFit and see if they have any people that have been to Brian’s seminar and are a decent coach). Not many people can teach themselves correct squatting technique, and if they do, a coach is usually needed to get it on track. Running is similar, and if anything more difficult because of it’s dynamic nature.</p>
<p>There are a lot of drills that can help you learn and improve running economy, and you should be able to find some on the <a href="http://crossfitendurance.com">CF Endurance website</a>. The two best cuing concepts I’ve used are “lift the foot up the inseam of your opposite leg” and doing it with a “relaxed ankle” (with the latter being the hardest). By pulling up an imaginary inseam (think of wearing pants), the foot goes up instead of back, and the relaxed ankle prevents unnecessary toe off. For lifters who have heard the “mid-foot” cue, it helps to imagine landing on that point, or slightly in front of it.</p>
<p>When introducing new running technique, <strong>EASE INTO IT</strong>. Lots of critics will cite how this new technique is more injurious than the old technique. However, with any new activity, slow and progressive increase of that activity is how to adapt optimally without injury. You may feel like you’re capable of more, yet the soreness after will be a reminder that you were wrong. Develop the new skill over time — Mackenzie recommends a six week introductory program before attempting regular workouts.</p>

  <p>Last night Brent started talking to me about a part of the podcast pertaining to cortisol and ejaculation (primarily masturbation in the podcast). Since we recorded it about three weeks ago, it rekindled his (our?) interest in it. I became interested in seeing what kind of research was done on ejaculation, testosterone, and cortisol. The results are compelling.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/402399">First Study</a>: Effects of ejaculation on levels of testosterone, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone in peripheral plasma of rhesus monkeys.</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show the details of this study” hide=”Hide the details of this study”]Okay…there’s a lot going on here. Let me highlight it for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mean levels of T and LH did not increase significantly after coitus or in control (no ejaculation) tests, but cortisol levels did in both cases</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, okay, that’s kind of interesting. Wait? They got some of the monkeys horny and then didn’t let them ejaculate? Christ, this is worse than water boarding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 10 different males, no significant change was found in the plasma levels of T after electroejaculation; but in control tests (electric current withheld)…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, what? Electroejaculation? Lemme wikipedia that shit…<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroejaculation">OH MY GOD</a>??? First they roofie the monkey, then an “electric probe is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate”. That’s French for “they stick something in his ass” and then shock him into cumming. While this may be regular practice in 47% of Catholic churches, it’s a new concept to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The effects on T levels produced by living with sexually receptive female rhesus monkeys may differ from those produced by intimate but brief contact with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, duh, no dude wants to sleep with his roommate. He hears her sit on the toilet and has to listen to her all day (the reciprocal is also true).</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/408381">Second Study</a>: Factors influencing sexual performance in male rhesus monkeys.</strong></p>
<p>This ought to be good.</p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show the details of this study” hide=”Hide the details of this study”]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 5-yr retrospective study of the sexual behavior of eight adult male rhesus monkeys showed that sexual vigor declined over the years but testosterone levels in peripheral vein plasma did not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt “sexual vigor” has been quantified, but god damn is it weird to imagine unshaven researchers looking in a cage and trying to figure out how sexy this monkey has or hasn’t been lately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eight different adult male rhesus strangers-present in the room but not in the test cage-were used as stimuli, one for each experimental test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ehhh…they brought in strangers to strip. I bet they <a href="http://pechonjr.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/the-stranger-2.jpg">wore masks</a>.</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1634402">Third Study</a>: Luteinizing hormone, testosterone, and behavioral response of male-oriented rams to estrous ewes and rams.</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler]If watching a bunch of rams having sex all day wasn’t enough…</p>
<p>“All right, it’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqjvkdV8jq8">gonna get a little weird</a>. We’re gonna watch gay rams have sex.”</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453003001616">Fourth Study</a>: Hormonal changes when falling in love</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show the details of this study” hide=”Hide the details of this study”]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FSH and testosterone levels were lower in men in love</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Welp, that about <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/forever-alone.jpg">settles it</a>, then.</p>
<p>…wait, what was I searching?</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ejaculation%20%2B%20testosterone">Fifth Study</a>: A research on the relationship between ejaculation and serum testosterone level in men.</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show the details of this study” hide=”Hide the details of this study”]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the 7th day of abstinence, however, a clear peak of serum testosterone appeared, reaching 145.7% of the baseline ( P &lt; 0.01).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7 DAYS? Maaaan…fucking forget it. [/spoiler]</p>

    Even though I&#8217;m disappointed in his legs, he&#8217;s daggy as fuck. A waist-up idol.<br /> <br /> In other news the weekly chat was last night in the form of a video cast. This new method allows me to easier answer questions, but more importantly I can show a portion of my screen &#8212; primarily lifting videos of YOU. The whole chat watches it together on the stream and I give corrections, points of emphasis, talk about related concepts, or just watch in entertainment. If you want form checks, then attend the cast early next week. Details are on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig">Facebook Fan Page</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/70sBig">Twitter</a> (you can see the updates to both in the twitter update in the left side bar of this page).<br />

  <p>Several years ago I made it a point to always encourage women to train with weights and high intensity exercise as opposed to the LSD methods associated with conventional fitness. It has, and always will be, an interest of mine because it benefits everyone; it benefits the chick because she’s <a href="http://www.hardbody.com/news/2008/12/erinstern2008.jpg">not beat down</a> by stupid conventional skinny-body dysmorphia, she’s healthier, she’s <a href="http://www.hardbody.com/news/2009/07/6126.jpg">stronger</a> and capable, and it benefits me (or her husband, boyfriend, etc.) cause she looks better. After coaching 50,000 squats, you can’t help but say, “Yeah, she’d be better if she squatted.”</p>
<p>I saw a quote the other day that said, “Women, we don’t care about your shoes, just your body. Go to the gym and not the store.” In the time that I’ve been training and coaching people — as well as the lifespan of this website — I’ve tried to show why and how training can benefit women.

<p>One of the female readers once asked, “What we can do to spread this message?” Personally, I don’t think it’s going to happen from this site; the message only reaches so far, and it’s typically getting to the women who already train (or at least who lift weights and condition regularly). I think that the realm of conventional fitness has to be broken into before this concept will become more popular. I hope that <a href="/blog/2011/08/fit-is-coming/">FIT</a> (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheFITBook">Fan Page</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thefitbook">Twitter</a>) can help open the door in what will be a long struggle of improving how people train. But will it be enough? Will it help mold America’s (the world’s?) perception of what an attractive woman will be?</p>
<p>I don’t know, because I’m very much <a href="/blog/2010/07/this-post-is-not-homo/">not a woman</a>, and my opinion may only be partially relevant. I had intended on interviewing some of the chicks I know through this site and getting their point of view for this post, but instead <strong>I welcome girls/chicks/women to post in the comments and give your thoughts on how you think training can be introduced and spread to a greater female population (whether through this site, on the internet, or in general)</strong>. We’ll see if we can draw any conclusions because I’m sincerely interested in the discussion.</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/70sBig">70’s Big Facebook Fan Page</a> we are organizing a 70’s Big Fantasy Football League. Go to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=377258928677&amp;topic=15686">this discussion</a> and enter in where you live. Since each league really shouldn’t have more than 10 teams, they will be broken up according to region. If you don’t have Facebook, then just post here in the comments or e-mail me. Some time next week we’ll schedule the drafting after everyone is organized.</p>
<p>And if you haven’t liked the fan page, then…fuck.</p>

<p>Here is an e-mail from Jay about how the site helped convince him to do a meet. He went 9/9 and had “one of the best experiences of (his) life”.</p>

<p>Hey Justin,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I competed for the first time in USAPL Michigan’s Smitty’s Iron Works 7 on Saturday July 30th in the 198 (I weighed in at 185) RAW division.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All in all it was a great day. I am glad I decided to compete because it was truly one of the best experiences of my life. I went 9/9 and ended up with at best squat of 330, bench was 286 and deadlift was 440. The biggest thing I learned was to make bigger jumps after my opener. I have very little experience with true one rep maxes and it showed. I was far to conservative in the squat, I had plenty in the tank after 330 and should have gone bigger. It got a bit better on the bench making a 40lb jump after attempt #2 but again I should have done that after my opener. I think next time I will go for 300 because 286 went up without much ado. By the time the deadlift rolled around I had the attempt process down. I opened with 403, which is the last 5 rep max I did (well 405) jumped to 424 an all time PR and nailed it. Then for attempt 3 I went for a goal of mine which was to pull 200kg. Truthfully I did not think I could do it, but then I got really psyched up, told my self it was coming off the floor and there’s nothing else that matters and pulled that fucker! Putting that bar down after a successful final lift of my first competition was a great feeling of relief and excitement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I found your site at a great time in my training career. Your insistence on competition as a focal point of and legitimizing factor to training hit home with me. As was all the meet recaps from Thunderthighs and Mike and others featured on your site. Thanks again and keep up the good work on 70sbig.com.</p>

  <a href="http://killustrated.com/">Dr. Lon Kilgore</a> has always aimed to develop the realm of fitness, exercise, and barbell training through research, teaching, and writing. His long term vision of developing a manual that anyone could pick up and read and get the real direction on how to get fit has come to fruition.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="/2011/08/FIT-cover.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4993" data-permalink="/blog/2011/08/fit-is-coming/fit-cover/" data-orig-file="/2011/08/FIT-cover.jpg" data-orig-size="720,443" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="FIT cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/08/FIT-cover.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/08/FIT-cover.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4993" title="FIT cover" src="/2011/08/FIT-cover.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>FIT started as a brief resource to address many of the common misconceptions about fitness and what it takes to program it, yet has morphed into a 300+ page book that beginning and advanced trainees alike can benefit from. <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/">Dr. Michael Hartman</a> and I were recruited to add content to what will be an incredibly informative book.</p>
<p>FIT provides the “why” and “how” of the purposeful integration of strength, endurance, and mobility training; addresses misinformation associated with fitness; and gives the readers direction to make decisions regarding their fitness. FIT fills the void in taking the theory and applying it to exercise programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="fit-table-of-contents">Fit: Table of Contents</h2>
<p>Fitness – What it is</p>

<p>The strength chapter alone would be well worth the price for a 70’s Big reader. At 50 pages it’s a hefty dose of programming at many levels including an array of templates that aren’t common in the “online training communities”.</p>
<p>The endurance chapter dissects why the traditional long, slow distance method of training isn’t effective, discusses the anatomy of endurance, provides a thorough analysis of running economy and technique, recommends efficient footwear, and discusses specific methods to prepare for endurance goals.</p>
<p>The mobility chapter provides knowledge on the physiology of stretching, motor abilities, how to improve agility and balance, and specific exercises and stretches that can help balance the body.</p>
<p>The 25,000+ word multi-element fitness chapter that I wrote funnels this information together and provides the direction for the fitness trainee. The hierarchy of emphasis in training elements is thoroughly explained and guidelines are provided to the reader. High intensity endurance training is categorized based on the level of stress it imparts on the body with very clear descriptions of each type. However, not all trainees need the toughest stress; types of trainees defined with very clear progressions on how to take someone from sedentary and very un-fit to a strong, sleek, and enduring specimen. There are lines of progression and programming templates for every type of trainee whether they aim to get strong and maintain their conditioning or get conditioned after a specialization in strength.</p>
<p>Each of these chapters are worth the book price alone, yet are all pieces of the project that has become FIT. The paper-back book will be released around August 15th on Amazon.com</p>
<p>Post any questions you have about the book to the comments.</p>

<p>Turns out Vince is a big mother trucker, and he kinda looks like the little dude who played Thor.</p>
<p>(By the way, the average guy in Australia is smaller and weaker than in America. Strength training is less popular there than it is here, and endurance training is what is en vogue. I’m not really a big guy and I stood out in most places. That must be why the media got all excited when Chris Hemsworth gained a couple of kilos to not be such a <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TQfzGwkQi9U/TcLDaxaO4ZI/AAAAAAAADSQ/O30Rj-NRk68/s1600/chris-hemsworth.jpg">girly man</a>. I’ll never understood why they cast him in the first place.)</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that Urbank <em>should</em> have been Thor, because a 7 foot tall muscular 300 pounder is definitely what I imagine when I think Mjölnir.</p>
<p>Urbank is a strongman competitor who just received his pro card in the <a href="http://www.americanstrongman.com/">American Strongman Corporation</a>. The former Marine trains powerlifting-style and doing extremely well:</p>

    "Backs are to lifters what biceps are to bodybuilders"
  </p>
</div>
<p>The famous IronMind poster is more than just an end-goal. It signifies the process of successful lifting. The back can collectively start at the upper traps which flow down into the spine of the scapula (the sideways ridge on your shoulder blade). The middle and lower traps (attaching all the way down to the last thoracic vertebrae) flow up and attach along that same position as well. Then, the rhomboids hold the medial (inside) border of the scapulae to the spine. The rear deltoids could be considered part of the back as well, and they attach along the spine of the scapula over the important external shoulder rotators (which are primarily located along different aspects of the scapula). However, it’s the <strong>middle/lower traps</strong>, <strong>lats</strong> (which attach anywhere from the iliac crest — rear hip area — to the mid thoracic area and funnel into an insertion on the medial aspect of the proximal humerus, or upper arm bone), and <strong>erector spinae muscles</strong> (i.e. spinal erectors) that attach along the vertebral column.</p>
<p><strong>What It All Does</strong></p>
<p>That collection of musculature has the primary of function of holding the trunk in proper alignment and posture during lifting. The upper back muscles maintain good thoracic extension during squatting, pressing, and deadlifting and they hold the scapulae together and maintain shoulder position on the bench. The lower back muscles hold the pelvis in place to allow for a stretch on the hamstrings during squats (specifically the low bar variation), deadlifts, RDLs, rack pulls, and other pulling movements. The back and hamstrings are so finely integrated that many movements train both at the same time. However, this area of the body is largely neglected because it can’t be seen easily in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>Training Inclusion</strong></p>
<p>Most training sessions, especially for less experienced lifters, should include a squat, a press, and a pulling movement. If you are worry about your back and hamstring strength or development, then it’s already too late. This should be the proudest area of your body as it will set you apart from others, balance your physique, and so effectively contribute to your lifting that most of everything else will improve along with the front of your physique. If you don’t currently include <a href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/"><strong>RDLs</strong></a> or a horizontal rowing movement, sprinkle them in your training week (this advice applies to any general strength trainee as well as powerlifters that aren’t tapering for a meet).</p>
<p><strong>Other Indicators of Back/Hamstring Weakness</strong></p>
<p>Some glaring indicators of requiring improved strength and musculature in the back and hamstrings include, but are not limited to dropping the chest in any movement, the torso tipping forward out of the bottom of a squat or at the start of a deadlift, a weak second pull in the Olympic lifts, and the knees scooping forward under the bar on heavy deadlift lockouts. While you may be able to get by with these inefficient mechanics, sooner or later you will reach a point that is too limited by your lack of back or hamstring strength that it must be addressed before progress can continue.</p>
<p><strong>Short on time?</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, if you are ever limited in your training time then make an effort to train your back, even if you neglect squatting. The back and hamstrings sometimes are so limiting for some trainees that accumulated work is necessary over time to develop them to improve the foundation lifts (squat, press, bench, and deadlift). Using RDLs as opposed to squats or deadlifts will be a good substitute when feeling overtrained, coming back from sickness, or easing back into training after a rough travel or work schedule. Furthermore, by getting the upper back musculature stronger and thicker, all upper body movements are reinforced and subsequently strengthened.</p>
<p>Making the upper back and hamstrings strong doesn’t have to be a soul draining experience. Lifts that improve these areas are easy to add into existing programs and might even need to maintain priority on those constrained training sessions. Rest assured, if you’re already doubting the strength or size of your backside, then you’re already in a deficiency — but it’s never too late to start.</p>
<p>Here are some more videos from the Australia trip that have nothing to do with building an impressive back.</p>

  <p>I met some pole dancers in Australia and they were both muscular and toned despite not lifting (I know Johnston is proud). I’ve <a href="/blog/2011/06/fembots/">mentioned before</a> that most women can garner a healthy physique by eating a non-vegetarian diet with plenty of meat (insinuating the animal kind here, boys). Such is the case with the pole dancers I met; by doing plenty of pulling movements their backs and bodies were developed and toned. Not only is this true, it’s just an excuse for you guys to watch pole dancing. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to spend time looking for a vid, so here’s footage of the 2011 Australian Pole Dancing Championship. Uh, if you work in a church, you probably don’t want to open this right now.</p>

<p>Regardless of your opinion on pole dancers or strippers, the pole work is impressive. It’s a non-boring version of gymnastics.</p>
<p>Here are some other videos from Australia. This one is footage from the nature park.</p>

<p>This one is me making fun of Tom because he can’t scramble eggs.</p>

<p>In this one from <a href="http://shirespeedandstrength.com.au/">Shire Speed and Strength</a>, Tom squats 150kg for a triple, I snatch 120 and 130 (I missed 130 at first, I thought it was 125 because I’m an idiot), and there’s some vid of Blake (who is playing football at Hawaii now) jerking 160).</p>
