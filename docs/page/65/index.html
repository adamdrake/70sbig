  I don&#8217;t really have any recent lifting videos that would be worth watching, but here&#8217;s a video of me doing rows with a 150 pound dumbbell for 20 reps.<br /> <br /> <iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WEwH2SPxv6k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>Usually there won’t be as many fucking videos of myself, but I’m finishing up a project today and haven’t had time for any other material. If you have a problem with that, then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH62Jd5qCj0&amp;feature=related">watch this</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally Brent and I will be in Monterey for a lifting workshop on July 9. Brent will just be there, giving you indiscriminate looks and I’ll coaching lifting technique. Then we’ll go to eat and hear Brent give us a fucking preface on his diet and training, implying that we need to take care of him like Gizmo from Gremlins.</p>

<p>Let’s get a good convo going in the comments. First I want to point out that I write and do a lot of weird stuff in posts or videos that no one ever comments on. I mainly do it just to see if anybody will say anything, but you guys apparently just accept it as normal. When my mom filmed the “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb76hFpEZ-s">helpful mobility vid</a>“, she goes, “Don’t you want to comb your hair and put on some shorts?” I didn’t hesitate to say, “Absolutely not. If anything it’s better this way.”</p>

  <p><strong>Simple Rib Recipe</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t grow up in Texas and I didn’t grow up eating expertly smoked meats. I’m not a cooking expert and I’m not Gant. However, this is the easiest and cheapest rib recipe ever.</p>
<p><strong>What You Need</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pork spare ribs (or whatever you want, but these will probably be cheaper)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some kind of barbecue dry rub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barbecue sauce (optional, but awesome)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casserole dish.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These ingredients won’t cost more than $15 to $20 the first time you make the ribs. After that, you’ll only need the ribs themselves. Ribs are at cost on a military base (mine were $1.76 a pound — almost 5 pounds for less than $9).</p>
<p><strong>What To Do</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rub the ribs down with the dry rub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the covered casserole dish in an oven heated to 275 degrees Fahrenheit. They’ll cook for 2 hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove, set oven to broil, and baste ribs with barbecue sauce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broil for about five minutes to caramelize the sauce</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I made a video of this simple recipe. Only the first three minutes have to do with the preparation of the ribs. Everything after that is commentary. Useful, but not necessary if you don’t want to watch a vid of me for 8 minutes.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.sanfranciscocrossfit.com/coaches.php">Kelly Starrett</a> is an extremely effective DPT. Most physical therapists aim at rehabbing people back from injuries, but doing so in a way that covers the baseline level of care to limit re-injury and legal issues. As with any profession, there are those who aim to run a swift business and garner an impressive income, and then there are others who truly aim to help not only their trainees and clients, but as many people as they can. Kelly is definitely the latter in his effort to help the CrossFit and athletic community improve their performance by maintaining upkeep on their body. Instead of just waiting for injury, Kelly aims to stave it off with preventative exercises and stretching. This concept is the act of improving mobility and is nowadays summed up as “mobility”.</p>

    Standard ops for Kelly
  </p>
</div>
<p>Kelly is a really, really good guy. He not only cares about teaching, but is innovative in how he takes the fundamental concepts that he learned in his doctoral program and disseminating that information for simple plublic consumption. I’ve told him this (as I stared longingly into his eyes) when I briefly got to chat with him a couple years ago at the first CrossFit Football Seminar. He’s a stand up guy, funny, and very effective. Learn from his website, <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/">MobilityWOD.com</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: An increasing number of my readers don’t come from a CF background: “WOD” is short for workout of the day.”</em></p>
<p>However, a lot of you lifters will gaze upon the MWOD and get a sensory overload. It can appear complicated at first look. Kelly is using bands to twist and torque his joints into positions, and then puts a kettlebell in his hand or on his belly, and the mobility noob is only confused, terrified, aroused, or all three. I hope this post will help some of you learn the basics of implementing mobility work. This isn’t Kelly Starrett endorsed, but it should give you a decent baseline to implement his recommendations well.</p>
<p>First, I want to point out that there is an entire <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/qa">FAQ</a> that will undoubtedly answer most of your questions. Take the time to read it. Additionally, this quote is on the home page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This blog is intended as a jump off point for athletes to systematically begin to address their nasty tissues and grody joint mobility. Use at your own risk and stop if you think it’s gonna hurt you, your spine is going to come out your throat, or your face goes numb. But, understand that you should be responsible for your own business. Don’t wait until you need a new knee. Pony up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>When To Do Mobility</strong></p>
<p>As Kelly points out, it can be done whenever. The obvious answer is, if it effects your workout, then don’t do it before. Brent has mentioned that doing some of the hip stretches make him feel loose at the bottom of his squats, cleans, or snatches. When I was Olympic weightlifting regularly, I did the “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5EO8mPonO0">3 stretches for lifters</a>” before every session because I either had to, or it made me feel better (my back and hip external rotators were chronically tight back then). At first, put mobility at the end of your workouts or before bed (it works well with most schedules, and you can do it in your underwear). If you do it chronically — like you should be — then you will notice the benefit in training. If you have range of motion limitations, then put some of them in your daily warm-up. The trade-off of losing some power capability for the sake of a better ROM will be worth it until you are more mobile. Most importantly, I’ll highlight this quote by Kelly in the FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line – be less concerned about when to do the MWOD and be more concerned about addressing your tissue health and range of motion problems. Above all else, the MobilityWod is about improving your capacity to be in a good position during movement to improve performance and avoid injury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that I had glute medius, hip flexor, and lumbar/sacral issues with my back a couple of years ago because of a lack of mobility work and guidance. This is why <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb76hFpEZ-s">I’m going out of my way to make sure that you guys do it</a>, because it can make a difference, subtle or dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>Where To Start?</strong></p>
<p>Brent talks about doing mobility work all the time on his <a href="/shrugthug/">training log</a> because he has made it a part of his training. People often ask him for advice, and he’s quick to point out, “I’m not special in knowing what to do, I just do it.” In other words, he just does the MWOD every day (usually in his underwear). By regularly doing it, you’ll find out where you are deficient. Once you know where you’re deficient, then you know what to focus on. There are videos where you may not have the equipment — lacrosse balls, bands, foam rollers, and other stuff — so emulate the stretch the best way you can.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what you’re deficient in and are totally lost with the MWOD videos, then start with the two videos I’ve made and do those regularly (again, they are videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5EO8mPonO0">one</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb76hFpEZ-s">two</a>). Of course, you don’t have to, but you’re the one that doesn’t know what to do. I highly recommend that you regularly watch Kelly’s videos daily along with doing the stretches I give you. Hearing the terminology regularly will help you understand what’s going on. Once you feel more comfortable, you can start branching out into some of the more complicated stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Common Deficiencies</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t even know how to gauge a ROM deficiency, then here are the most common. First, what kind of job or activity do you do on a normal basis? The majority of you would say, “I’m sitting in a chair doing x”. That means your hips are in flexion, your knees are bent, your back is slouched, your shoulders are rolled forward, and your chin is down while you’re looking forward. This produces impressive tightness in the hip flexors, the hip external rotators, the lower back, the internal rotators of the shoulder, and the anterior and lateral neck muscles. Start trying to stretch those areas immediately. In the “3 stretches for lifters” video, the focus is on the hip and back region. However, there are plenty of other common issues in the shoulder and neck region. If you don’t know that you’re lacking mobility in these areas, the best way to test the area is to do the stretches in Kelly’s videos and find out for yourself. If you haven’t really done any stretching at all (lately or ever), then I will guarantee that you’ll be tight in the areas I indicated earlier in this paragraph.</p>
<p>A lot of these stretches don’t merely have an effect on the specific muscle and tendon that is being stretched; they will have an effect on the entire body. Loosening up the hips with a couch and table top stretch can help relieve tension off the back. Working on the proximal portion of the psoas as well as the scalenes can will alleviate tension on the upper body region and allow the shoulders to be opened up. The body is an impressive chain of related structures, and by continuously working on them you’ll receive a large scale benefit instead of just at one specific location.</p>
<p>The following videos are good introductions to some of the basic stretches as well as some of the concepts of related regions that I just alluded to.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Videos</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/-ZX1QMTdAC4">Hip Flexo</a>r (“couch stretch”, funny vid)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoXIIVywwic&amp;feature=player_embedded">Hip External Rotators</a> (“table top stretch”)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKzK9EvzogY&amp;feature=player_embedded">More external hip rotators</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EURick0KUQI&amp;feature=player_embedded">Psoas and Scalene interaction</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9bYQUHqhFc&amp;feature=player_embedded">Stretching muscles around the scapula</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXCyNiSGrEs&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=314">More shoulder goodness</a>, with a dowel</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyLohjF0X6o&amp;feature=player_embedded">Soft Tissue of the Shoulder</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tx_qGl_L74&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=284">A good review on all shoulder mobs to improve internal rotation</a></p>
<p>These are just but a few videos that highlight each area of the body. There are probably better videos than what I listed here, but you’ll see the common trends on each body part. Kelly will have the daily MWODers repeat stretches, but he’ll also find clever variations to work the structures in a different way. The best way to start is to start; just do the stretches and make it a habit. It will help you prevent injury, recovery from injury, and will even help improve the efficiency of your lifts. Some of the mechanics are difficult to understand if you don’t have an anatomy background, but just do the stretches. The mechanics can be explained later, but you can’t improve your capability until you start. You have 96 increments of 15 minutes in a 24 hour day; using one or half of one of those for mobility isn’t a big sacrifice and it will yield impressive improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Voice Your Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, I’ll open the comments section up to anything mobility related. Feel free to post any videos that really helped you or other videos you thought I left out. Keep in mind that everyone is different, so there will be varying tightness or deficiency in each individual.</p>

  <p>Monday is the day where we talk about 70’s Big Females. Here are some videos worth checking out.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of Cori snatching 75kg.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhW7oZZ8KL8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This next one is a simple clean with an easy power jerk at 85kg? This meet was from last November (Mid American Championships in Buffalo Grove, IL), but she broke her wrist shortly after the meet. Cori just started to snatch and jerk last week, and she maxed with a 72kg snatch and 85kg on the clean and jerk. There are plenty of guys who don’t lift more than that. Good luck with the continued rehab, Cori.</p>

</div>

<p>You may remember Lily from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZH5Xa-aqZA">this video</a>, but here’s an older video of her pulling 225 for a triple. She’s probably weighing 140 here?</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Lastly, you have probably seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87D-JyichM">this video</a> of Olympian Cara Heads (squatting 146kg/321.2 pounds for a set of ten). Here’s a video that shows that she’s in great shape despite lifting constituting the majority of her training careers. She’s pretty awesome.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSXBx1yJHds" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>

  <p>I haven’t been doing mobility work as much as a should, and travelling and writing all day aren’t helping. The few things that prevent me from doing it are a) efficient use of the time b) setting a clock to help me gauge the length of each stretch, and c) the prospect of getting into a pain-in-the-ass position.</p>
<p>This video introduces an interval timer that will automatically chime and repeat itself so you can string various stretches together. I give an example of the MINIMUM stretches a lifter should be doing. If you guys aren’t doing these stretches, then use this method. At the very least, the “3 Stretches For Lifters” can be done in less than seven minutes of time. Of course, it would be better to hold each stretch for longer than one minute, but one minute is better than no minute.</p>
<p><em>Edit: How the hell did this video get 2 views before I even looked at it?</em></p>

<p>Secondly, this thread happened last night. It’s a solid thread, but the implications are interesting. I expect to hear about this for a while from Brent.

  <p>I’m still trying to finish my work up on “FIT”, so here are some interesting Q&amp;A’s from recent comments interspersed with some videos.</p>
<p><strong>Question about alternating deadlifts and rack pulls on a TM, and then my response about active deloading in this specific scenario.</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show It” hide=”Hide It”]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ron Viking says:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Question for anyone with experience:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am going to start alternating deadlifts with rack pulls, and I was wondering how much heavier people typically start with rack pulls.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I pulled 190×5 two Fridays ago, and 195×4 last Friday. I was thinking somewhere around 210 for rack pulls? I will feel it out as I warm-up/acclimate, but I was just curious to hear others’ advice and experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will be pulling from below the patella. Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>_I assume you’re using kilos. If you’re going to do the rack pulls below the knee, and do them correctly, then you’ll find it difficult to do them much higher than where your dead is at, especially when you start.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As for your program, altering DLs and rack pulls every week will stop progressing pretty quickly. It’d be better if you treated your DLs with an active deload if the rack pulls were something that you were set on doing (probably to improve your lockout, if I had to assume).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ron Viking says:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the reply, Justin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, those numbers were kilos. And as far as programming goes, I have been using a TM setup with Squat/Bench or Press/Deadlift on intensity day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How frequently would you suggest utilizing an active deload, and with what protocol? Something like a triple with my last successful set of 5? Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>_I would have you squat every intensity day. I would cycle your deadlift stuff. But I’m just a guy who wrote an e-book on it. (EDIT: He is squatting every intensity day.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The active deload concept would have you use a movement with a mechanical disadvantage with respect to the original lift. In the case of the deadlift, I’d probably tell you to just pull it with a regular double overhand hook grip instead of alternating your grip, using a hook, or using straps. Obviously you can’t lift as much with a double overhand grip, and the lighter load and fewer reps will be less than had you used the alternate/hook/straps. This would allow you to still deadlift (as opposed to doing something that is drastically different), and provide the “deload” so you can still push heavy on the rack pulls (in this example you would alternate the overhand deadlift and rack pulls every week). This would be exceptionally useful if you were powerlifting, but I don’t know your goals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question on Linearly Progressing Weighted Chins</strong></p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show It” hide=”Hide It”]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>rknaughton asks:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You can’t linearly progress weighted chins.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>True, in my experience. But I don’t understand *why* this is true, and I’m perplexed on that point. Justin (or anyone else), could you say a bit about *why* linear progression doesn’t work here? Just curious. Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>_Did I say that? If I did, it was because you can’t do them on a daily basis and recover. That’s a stress that is “more than body weight” on a small (relatively speaking) amount of musculature. The structures (in this case tendons and muscles) would not be able to recover on a daily basis. You can linearly progress them in that they can have weight added to them every session, but that will only be once or twice a week (and will look linear over time).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did that help? (EDIT: It did.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p>I thought that this video by <strong>Epic Meal Time</strong> was funny, but more so because of the response it got.</p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show Vid” hide=”Hide Vid”]
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3kOHWOisDfw" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
[/spoiler]</p>
<p>The Epic Meal Time gang went out to Montreal, got drunk, and ate a bunch of food while acting rowdy. It was directly funny and satirically funny, and a bunch of people got butt hurt about it. At the time of me writing this, there are over 37,000 dislikes on the video. Others said the were unsubscribing. I made this comment on the video:</p>
<p>“I think all of these poons who are upset about this video are hilarious. You were okay with the guys spending hundreds of dollars and getting drunk at home, but when they do it in the city, you’re upset? Grow up.”</p>
<p>Someone has since replied to me saying they “appear more arrogant here”. This is a case of the missing sense of humor. Someone call the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OM1G-pyqRE&amp;NR=1">Hardly Boys</a>. This is also the case of “too dense for satire”. Jonathan Swift — who had huge balls (a testament to his boldness, not his scrote) — would roll over in his fucking grave. One of my pet peeves are people not having a sense of humor and then thinking that anyone gives a shit about them not having a sense of humor. If you don’t like them anymore based on one video, who cares? Just fucking unsubscribe and don’t look at it anymore.</p>

  If you are a fan of the 70&#8217;s Big Facebook Page, then you will have already seen this announcement. I&#8217;ve been working on a project with Dr. <a href="http://lonkilgore.com/">Lon</a> <a href="http://killustrated.com/">Kilgore</a> and <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/">Dr. Michael Hartman</a>. It&#8217;s a general fitness book called &#8220;FIT&#8221; and is a guide to make you exactly that. The book dives into quality chapters on the quantified parameters of fitness: strength, endurance, and mobility. Here&#8217;s a teaser, and stay tuned for more as we near the August release date:

<p><strong>Edit: I just want to point out that even if you aren’t a “fitness trainee”, this book is chock full of quality information, even if you’re merely a strength trainee who wants to add in conditioning. The strength and endurance chapters alone are worth the money and could be books by themselves. Then we take the concepts of strength, endurance, and mobility and tie them all together and teach how they should be structured and programmed. Feel free to ask questions and stay tuned for excerpts and features.</strong></p>
<p>This is a video of Glenn Pendlay cleaning 170 quite a few years ago. I think it’d be cool to see more of these converted home videos. I think this might be the old WFAC location?</p>

<p>This is a sweet video of Dmitry Klokov clean and jerking 242 in training. With a head band. And spandex. And a tank-top. And beast mode. As he walked away I’m pretty sure he said, “Bitches ain’t shit.”</p>

<p>May as well show you this other Klokov vid to keep this “sweet music” theme alive. He almost snatches 214kg off of blocks. Almost.</p>

  <p>This past weekend I went to Toronto, Canada to do a Workshop Weekend that consists of a lifting workshop on Saturday and a programming workshop on Sunday. It was my first time in Canada since stepping over the line at Niagra Falls when I was ten (do they still let you do that? or do you need a passport?), and it was excellent. I was hosted by two stellar dudes, Chris and Paul — thanks again to both of you guys and I hope we get to hang soon without a workshop getting in the way. They live outside of Toronto in a small town area that reminds me of rural Pennsylvania. The weather was beautiful; around 80 degrees (F), no humidity, and a cool breeze.</p>
<p>The workshop itself was good fun, Canadians have a pleasant disposition. I even noticed that I started emulating their tone in talking, specifically the upward inflection at the end of sentences. Contrary to the American belief, Canadians don’t say, “Eh?” all the time, but they do defecate in inappropriate places when challenged.</p>
<p>I hope the attendees walked away from each day confident in what they need to do to lift or program well. Two attendees who were only signed up for the Saturday portion were allegedly impressed enough to sign up for Sunday’s as well. You guys can e-mail me any time with questions as well as videos of your technique (preferably from a front or rear 45 degree angle). Stay in touch either on the site, Facebook, or e-mail. Remember the one or two cues you have on each lift! Work those rehab exercises in, Sandy and Adam. Make sure your chest is up, Silen. Good luck at your meet, Rowan, and keep doing that anterior shoulder mobility. Kyle, make sure your knees are out in your deadlift set up. Blake, reinforce that leaning over to avoid being to upright in the squat, and don’t get in a hurry with your reps. Paul, stop being so handsome. Mike, be smooth of the floor in your pull (along with that other proper set up stuff). James, your squat/pull were much better when you corrected those fundamentals like stance and chest up. I could go on, but hopefully you guys wrote down what you need for each lift. Also keep in mind all of the tools you have to administer a proper dose of stress to get an appropriate adaptation based on your current adaptation.</p>
<p>I actually don’t have any pictures whatsoever of this weekend; I was just too busy. I also wanted to get some video of the lifting transformations, but I misplaced the SD card for my camera. It’s disappointing, because I wanted a pic with my Canadian homies Chris and Paul (their biceps and behavior when drinking exceeded expectations). Thanks again to both of you guys, especially Chris and Melissa for letting a filthy American rest at your domicile. Paul, tell Sharon that Melissa totally ran off with the cab driver after Chris passed out.</p>
<p>All in all, I was impressed with Canada. It was a sport.</p>
<p>Since I don’t have any pictures, here’s a place that I want to visit in Canada.</p>

  <p><a href="http://ditillo2.blogspot.com/">The Tight Tan Slacks of Dezbo Ban</a> is a fantastic website that is full of legendary stories and articles from over half a century ago. <a href="http://ditillo2.blogspot.com/2009/03/marvin-eder-gene-mozee.html">THIS</a> article on Marvin Eder is very interesting several reasons.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/06/eder-press.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4600" data-permalink="/blog/2011/06/marvin-eder/eder-press/" data-orig-file="/2011/06/eder-press.jpg" data-orig-size="300,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;HP psc2400&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="eder press" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/06/eder-press.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/06/eder-press.jpg" src="/2011/06/eder-press.jpg" alt="" title="eder press" width="300" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4600" /></a></p>
<p>Mark Eder and the Canadian Colossus Doug Hepburn were having a legit face off, a showing of strength on muscle beach. THIS WAS FOR ALL THE MARBLES</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The action heated up when the bar reached 420. Juliano dropped out, but that was no disgrace for a 17-year old superman. Eder, not much older at 19, blasted out two reps with 420. Hepburn also rammed up the 420. Eder then did 430 pounds in strict style – thereby setting a new, albeit unofficial, world record. Hepburn lifted the same poundage and announced the fact that he was just warming up. he then benched 440, but his form was so rough Marvin said, “Nice lift, Doug. You must have lost two inches off your chest the way the bar bounced off your pecs.” Everybody in the large crowd surrounding the workout area laughed. Except Doug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bet Doug was pissed, but did he start a fight? Did he break a bottle over his head and try and stab Eder with the pieces?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hepburn, who set a world record in the military press at the National Weightlifting Championships a few days later, went into his strongman prop bag and brought out a thick leather belt, with which he strapped two 45-pound plates together. He lifted the plates overhead with his left hand, then lowered them until his arm was parallel to the ground. It was known as the one-arm holdout. He held the weights in the muscled-out position for five seconds. The crowd gasped and applauded. They went wild when Eder duplicated the feat – and held the plates out for 10 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, the strong men of lore. So impressive — yet Eder is obnoxiously impressive. Read the article, because I won’t be able to cover it all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Muscle photographer Art Zeller remembered seeing Marvin Eder hold his arms out while a 150-pound hand-balancer named Maurice Maruitz put his hands on Eder’s wrists s though they were parallel bars, leapt up, and went into a handstand. “Eder just stood there like a rock, without quivering at all. He looked like he could have stood there all day,” Zeller said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for his top end strength:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eder’s feats of strength include a 515-pound bench press, squatting 550-pounds for 10 deep reps, 12 one-arm chins and a 365-pound overhead press. At the 1951 Pan-American Games tryouts, he surpassed the world record in the press with 337 at a bodyweight of 192, but the AAU refused to let him compete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And lastly, as a 67 year old (in 1999), Eder was still training and looking solid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today (1999), at age 67, Marvin can still do 100 dips anytime, and more amazing, 90 chinups. I saw him last year at the Oldetime Barbell &amp; Strongmen’s annual dinner. H told me that his three-times-a-week workout consists of five sets of chins for 50 reps, five sets of dips for 50 reps and 550 alternate jumping lunge squats. He still weighs 197 pounds and looks sensational.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s so awesome. Eder is now one of my strength idols.</p>
