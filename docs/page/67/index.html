  <p>Some of you may remember how Sal Giunta was awarded the Medal of Honor — the highest military decoration available — for his actions during a deployment to the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. A month from now Sgt. 1st Class Leroy Arthur Petry will <a href="http://www.shadowspear.com/special-operations-news/105694-army-ranger-leroy-petry-medal-of-honor.html">receive the same decoration</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Petry was assigned to Company A, 2nd Bn., 75th Ranger Regiment while in Afghanistan. During a rare day-time raid, Petry and another Ranger were clearing a courtyard in a mission to capture a high value target. They were both wounded (Petry was shot through both legs), took cover in a chicken coop, and were joined by a third Ranger. After surviving a grenade blast from ten feet away, another grenade was thrown into the chicken coop several feet from the soldiers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognizing the threat that the enemy grenade posed to his fellow Rangers, Petry — despite his own wounds and with complete disregard for his personal safety — consciously and deliberately risked his life to move to and secure the live enemy grenade and consciously throw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers, according to battlefield reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As Petry released the grenade in the direction of the enemy, preventing the serious injury or death of Higgins and Robinson, it detonated and catastrophically amputated his right hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With a clear mind, Petry assessed his wound and placed a tourniquet on his right arm. Once this was complete, he reported that he was still in contact with the enemy and that he had been wounded again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that this deserves repeating. Petry saw a live grenade a few feet from his soldiers, moved towards it, picked the fucking thing up, and chucked it away as it blew his hand off. Then what did he do? He fucking put a tourniquet on his own arm, and then fucking reported what happened.</p>
<p>“You, this is me, I was wounded again, don’t have a hand, situation normal, over.”</p>
<p>Yes, this is real life.</p>
<p>I can’t talk about lifting or even think about people bitching at each other online about training when a story like this needs to be told. Everything else is just so fucking irrelevant.</p>

  <p>Hopefully the quick few words on <a href="/blog/2011/05/a-word-on-programming/">programming</a> the other day helped steer some of you in a better direction, whether you needed to get focused or expand your horizons. Today I want to talk about a set and rep scheme that has been around for a while, but may be interesting to some of the readers looking to tweak their programming.</p>
<p>There’s no way to tell who invented what and when, but Steve Shafley posted <a href="http://powerandbulk.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=5756&amp;highlight=primer">a nice summary</a> on using ladders to increase strength in 2005 on <a href="http://powerandbulk.com/">Power and Bulk</a>. The premise is using some kind of ladder to garner some volume (relatively speaking). The standard ladder example consists of sets of 1/2/3 (one rep, then a double, then a triple), and typically at least three ladders are done in a workout with a given exercise. In this kind of set up, all the reps of all the ladders shouldn’t be difficult. If you look at Shaf’s explanation, he used it three days a week for close grip bench and had some nice progress (although I want to point out that I don’t know his training history or preceding program to using the ladder method — remember, programming is relative to the individual). Shaf also points out that this method will relatively have higher volume and lower intensity.</p>

<p>Recently Dr. Hartman did a post on <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/2011/03/squat-ladders.html">playing around with ladders</a>, citing the P&amp;B post. Whereas Shaf found that the volume was what helped drive progress, Dr. Hartman used this the lower rep scheme to accumulate some volume with heavier loads.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have capped my number of ladders at 3, so a typical ladder on Wednesday would be 1/2/3/1/2/3/1/2/3; 9 sets and 18 total reps. With the increased number of sets, and lower max reps per set, you are able to train at a heavier load than you could with a similar volume but different configuration (6×3, 4×4, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you check out Hartman’s post, he had a nice little progression by using this method (he front squatted MF and back squatted on W). Both of these examples implement the set/rep scheme very differently, yet both garnered an improvement in strength. The similarities is that both of Shaf and Hartman used it to get some accumulated volume — each 1/2/3 ladder is six reps, and three to five ladders is 18 to 30 reps. Shaf used the method on one exercise, similar to a Russian-style of greasing the groove. Hartman used it on his back squats to break through a training plateau with heavier loads. Shaf’s goal was low fatigue on each set whereas Hartman wanted to push his ladders to reach into his 150kg 3RM realm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My progression was as follows: 120kg – 3 ladders, 130 – 3, 135 – 3, 140 – 2, 140 – 3, 145 – 2, 145 – 3, and this week 150kg – 3 ladders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever I read something new or are reminded of an old principle, I like to think how I can implement it into the style of programming I use. Most linear progressions are so basic that they don’t need to worry about ladders, yet ladders would be good to bring up a lacking strength and mass with Shaf’s accumulated workload style in someone that is beyond the LP necessity. Hartman’s higher intensity method would be more of a short term plateau buster — probably not something that would be used in the long run. However, the principle could be implemented in any program.</p>
<p>The S&amp;C Program that I outlined could shift from a) a basic three sets of five rep scheme to b) a Greyskull three sets of five with the last set going for as many reps as possible, and then c) a ladder set-up that allows for more weight to be handled (higher intensity) with medium levels of volume (three 1/2/3 ladders = 18 reps). The ‘high intensity’ ladder twist could potentially be used on a Volume Day for a <a href="/blog/2011/05/the-texas-method-e-book/">Texas Method</a> style program, but I wouldn’t use it on anyone unless they progress through the lower volume schemes I detailed in the e-book (and I still would only use it in limited situations). Any basic template could use a ladder set up if pertinent, and they could be cycled with other things like ascending/descending/sets across of doubles/triples/fives/tens, or rep target power building stuff. Basically it’s another shade of ink that a programming artist can use to paint a strong, powerful, well built man.</p>

  <p>Take a deep, luxurious breath. How does it feel? Normal? It should feel both normal and abnormal.</p>
<p>It’s normal because it’s the same as the million of breaths that have come before it. You’re an American breathing freely whilst pursuing your life’s happiness. Yet it’s abnormal and weird because the only reason you’re content taking that breath is because there is a man who has earned it for you.</p>
<p>This man has pulled on his boots, shouldered his pack, and squeezed the stock of his rifle, sweating. This man forfeited his freedoms, left his family, and sacrificed his youth. This man did all of this, yet isn’t compensated for his sacrifices.</p>
<p>This man is the reason you are able to take your next breath, the reason you can wake up in the morning and do whatever you damn well please. This man protects the richest of the rich, yet also enables the dredge of society to suck the teat and be rewarded for sloth. He’s the reason that a bar fight, this website, or a children’s spelling bee can exist. His sacrifice is blind to the recipients’ outcome, yet it is all encompassing nonetheless.</p>
<p>You may have known the man with the rifle, yet he has existed for more than 200 years and he gives you this next breath freely. You are free to do whatever you want with that breath, but it’d be a disgrace if it wasn’t spent doing everything you can to be the best person, father, brother, friend, son, worker, or stranger that you can. Your last breath was a freebie; now earn your next in honor of those riflemen who make breathing possible.</p>

  <p>A lot of people like to hear about strength and conditioning programming. There are three basic ways that you derive a method of programming.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Directly observing set/rep schemes and what kind of progress they induce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hard research on strength training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding physiology, anatomy, and trends of how the body responds to stress over time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with #1 is that it’s typically associated with a rudimentary understanding of physiology. More importantly it lacks context. If someone increases their bench 30 pounds in six weeks, that doesn’t mean your bench will do the same. That’s why copying a famous lifter’s programming is largely irrelevant; the context of training history and expression of their genotype is lost.</p>
<p>The problem with #2 is that it is locked within the confines of academia-based research. There are some quality principles that have come from research like the rep range continuum (strength, hypertrophy, and endurance) as well as power production and rest periods. Yet taking research at its face value can be a mistake, because it also lacks context. Research is specifically designed to begin with specific populations and instead of making generalizations based on those findings, more research on other populations is supposed to be done. Furthermore, a lot of the questions in research are not focused to anything that can help a hardcore practitioner or go off on irrelevant tangents (or it’s so shittily done; there are many studies on the back squat that don’t even define the squat’s parameters).</p>
<p>#3 does well because it conceptually basis training on information known about the body and how it responds over time. However, #3 cannot exist without #1 and #2. Without the practitioners testing their own programs and without researchers definitively finding things in specific organizations, #3 wouldn’t have any trends to base their “educated guesses” on. The collection of all of this information lets us know how to progress a beginning trainee through the first year or so of their training, yet from then on there are various routes that can be followed. This is where the art of programming comes in, and it’s indirectly a collection of the three sources of information above.</p>
<p>When you read anything about programming, whether it’s on Elite FTS, Westside Barbell, Starting Strength, the Texas Method set-up, Strength Villain, or 70’s Big, you have to actually <em>think</em> about what you’re reading. You can’t just directly apply it to your situation, because it’s most likely irrelevant. You have to take into consideration your current ability, your training history, your recent programming, your height/weight/age, and several other data points. Not many people can do this objectively, but that’s the key to programming. Programming isn’t a “program” that a coach uses and implements. Instead, it’s diagnosing what a trainee or athlete needs and wants, and then structuring their training in order to make progress to achieve those things. It isn’t black and white.</p>
<p>Keep these ideas in mind when you consider your own programming or others. If you’re a “keyboard coach” who always pipes up and gives advice, then instead of telling people what to do, ask questions. Learn. That’s what a good programmer does, and that’s what I try to accomplish with this site; to help you learn.</p>

  <p>Hey guys, this is Honey Badger reporting.</p>
</br>
<p>I actually read about this on the highly esteemed <a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=134752531">bodybuilding.com forums</a>, but there is apparently a niche meet held in Russia in which lifters invited to the Super Cup of Titans compete for highest total <strong>irregardless</strong> of their weight class, so you have guys like Andrey Belyaev at 220 going up against Andrey Malanichev at 275.</p>
</br>
<p>The entire meet roster is full of badasses obviously. See Malanichev squatting 450kg/993lbs with a belt + knee wraps. Note that he misses it on his 2nd attempt and retakes it for a 3rd to get three white lights. lol?</p>

</div>

</br>
<p>Rules at Super Cup of Titans are the same as IPF, complete with walking the weight out of the rack and back in, stringent depth standards, and single-ply gear.</p>
</br>
<p>Before I go on, let me clarify that relative strength is irrelevant. A “double bodyweight squat” isn’t a big deal if you weigh 150lbs (or in my case, 164lbs ……….), and comparing the fact that a lighter lifter lifts “relatively” more than a heavier lifter is fucking asinine and pathetic.</p>
</br>
<p>One of the standouts in this meet, however, would be 220lbs Andrey Belyaev, who placed 3rd in this meet despite being the lightest contender. See the results <a href="http://titans2011.base4you-test.ru/">here</a>. Let me point out that the difference between Belyaev and the typical bodyweight-multiple wannabe is that Belyaev totaled fucking 1100kg/2420lbs in single ply and is also an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IZoTSkz39fM">insanely strong</a> raw lifter:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Also, Belyaev may have been the lightest contender but at like 5’8″, 220lbs isn’t necessarily “small.” He’s fucking jacked like a motherfucker.</p>
</br>
<p>When it comes down to being reality, you don’t have to put the addendum, “and I only weigh xxxlbs” to your lifts if you are actually strong. If you are like Belyaev you can say “I deadlift 380kg/836lbs raw” and that’s the end of the discussion. Everyone nods their heads and says “yeah that’s pretty legit” and nobody has to add “… for your bodyweight” to make you feel better.</p>
</br>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg6uxSQbppk&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=315">A short interview with Belyaev, his coach, and his family</a>.</p>
</br>
<p>Take away points relevant to us:</p>
</br>
<p>1.) Everybody can be strong in their own gym, <strong>but result must be shown in competition</strong>. Fuckin’ A.</p>
</br>
<p>2.) No matter what place he takes at the tournament, <strong>he will stand</strong>. Who fucking gives a shit if he will be the lightest contender at a meet. Come at him, bro. Fuck excuses. If you go to a meet, go to fucking compete.</p>
</br>
<p>3.) He won a lot of titles in 2010 after leaving the IPF, <strong>but results were too far from ideal</strong>. Going to meets isn’t about placing when there are 3 lifters total in your weight class, and it’s not about being a big fish in a little pond. No one cares about a $5 medal you got because you just showed up. It’s about achieving the best competition results you’re capable of posting. Challenge yourself. Strive to get better. This is probably the most important thing you can do as an athlete. Titles, trophies, and medals couldn’t be more irrelevant.</p>

  <p>Ben hit a 171kg at the NorCal Open on Sunday. His meet PR was 165. He opened at 166.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vygywBrqLCQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Ben missed 175 after. He <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi0KvwJ0yZo&amp;feature=player_embedded">snatched 140</a> in the meet (go <a href="http://alongthelinesof.com/2011/05/23/728/">here</a> for his write up).</p>
<p>In other news, Brent is still being an asshole and snatching with iron plates. He had an overall PR of 235 pounds recently. In his words: should note that those are not bumpers, setting is a globo gym, and this is me not giving a fucking shit.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>The last time he was snatching around that weight, he was weighing 180 or so. In this video, he’s 164. Not a big deal, really.</p>
<p>What happens after snatching with iron plates? Clean and jerking with iron plates, of course.</p>

</div>

<p>May as well <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MMkypQWJeU&amp;feature=player_embedded">deadlift right after</a>, slow touch and go. Make sure and read the info on this vid. Oh, and the shirt he’s wearing is a picture of an astronaut with the caption, “<a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=QW-ASTRO&amp;Category_Code=QW-SHIRTS">Not all dreams can come true</a>.”</p>
<p>Lastly, I posted this video a long time ago, but Ben recently re-posted this on his training log. <a href="/?s=ricky+bruch">Ricky Bruch</a> is so awesome.</p>

  <p>In ‘Merica, the seasons are changing and the sun is warmly shining. Men are supposed to enjoy the outdoors; all things that are important occur under the stars. There’s no sense in not having a delightful little sun bath. Some of you may remember that over a year ago I was minding my own business when a jealous brigand yelled from his motorcar, “GET A TAN, BUDDY!” whilst wearing a wife beater and sporting a sleek, fake tan. I couldn’t have been less impressed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this is happening:</p>

<p>Not only is it okay for you to have your shirt off outside, but it’s entirely necessary. I never understood the poor souls who wanted to walk around in beautiful weather and NOT feel the breeze against their skin. If you’re self conscious about how you look, then fucking do something about it. Until then, boldly stop giving a shit.</p>
