  <h2 id="on-perseverance">On Perseverance</h2>
<p><em>by Mike Hom and Justin</em></p>
<p>There’s something to be said about perseverance.</p>
<p>The constraints of the universe will dictate what happens to a person, yet it takes a ballsy person to give the universe a big middle finger.</p>
<p>The psychological, emotional, and physiological commitment to excellence during training carries over to everything in life: how you compete, how you fight, and how you carry yourself. Perseverance is holding steady to your conviction and telling yourself that you will continue no matter the obstacles, no matter what the universe wants to say.</p>
<p>A good friend often reminds me, “You can hope, or you can know,” pretty much every day we train together. It’s rather profound when you approach the bar and ask yourself, “Do I hope, or do I know I will make this lift?” Shit, you better be answering that question with one answer only: “I fucking know.”</p>
<p>I don’t want to get too Tony Robbins here, but I’ve said it before: 70’s Big is an attitude. We joke about 70’s Big being about 200+ lbs. or having a majestic beard that Paul Bunyan would be proud of. But let’s face it, a lot of the readers on this site are just about getting stronger and using the right resources to achieve their goals. Body weight isn’t as important as what manifests inside and outside. Now, if you’re 6’5″ and weighing in at 185 lbs., you need to grab some milk, a barbell, and go to work. But in all reality, it’s about telling yourself that you’re going to be better than you are now. It’s about telling yourself that being “good enough” is the same as “I’m okay with being mediocre.”</p>
<p>There will be a defining moment in training (or life) where the universe tries to spit in your face. Will you accept the defeat and walk away?</p>
<p>Nah, you’re gonna say, “Fuck that,” and spit right back.</p>

  <p><em>Mondays are devoted to the 70’s Big Females out there who train to get stronger and look great doing it.</em></p>
<p>Lily is a consistent presence in her north Florida gym. I’ve seen her post online about hitting up squats, deadlifts, snatches, or clean and jerks on holidays — every day is just another training day for Lily. Her 145 pound frame holds a 40″ ass with ease, which easily passes the 38″ mark set for 70’s Big Females. It isn’t just for show; Lily brings her lunch pail to the gym to do some fucking work. Here is the second set of five of high bar squatting 185 for 10 reps. I’ll repeat that again: five sets of 185×10…40 pounds above body weight. And it’s not even hard.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>The thing about Lily is that she’s training hard all the time. She doesn’t dabble just because someone told her to squat; she lifts because she loves it. She’s, yet again, proof that lifting and being strong not only doesn’t make a woman BIG, but she’s also proof that there are hardcore women that are lurking behind the scenes in gyms across the world…un-racking the bar <em>one more time</em>.</p>

  <p>I talk with Johnny Pain of StrengthVillain.com about the origins of Greskull Barbell, the unique attitude of his gym, the Greyskull Linear Progression, body image in training, general programming, and Bony stories (which are worth a listen by itself). JP is amusingly tired in the beginning, but he perks up. Talking to him is always a learning and entertaining experience. Bony for President!</p>

  <p><em>by Dr. Michael Hartman, from his site (with permission) <a href="http://www.doctorhartmanblog.com/">Dr. Hartman Blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>Any positive change in performance is connected to our ability to adapt to the training program, given that the program is based on a progressive overload in training load over time. In long term training plans the improvement in performance will continue as long as the athlete continues to adapt. Once adaptation occurs it is essential to increase the training load usually through an increase in volume of training or intensity of training but rarely through a change in training frequency. Meaning, volume of training will always be determined by the desired intensity of training. As intensity increases, by definition, there has to be a decrease in training volume. So, those variables will change but only proportional to one another.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/05/march.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4164" data-permalink="/blog/2011/05/increased-training-frequency/march/" data-orig-file="/2011/05/march.jpg" data-orig-size="320,232" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="march" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/05/march.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/05/march.jpg" src="/2011/05/march.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="232" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4164" /></a></p>
<p>Many athletes who are not professional and train recreationally do not have the ability to increase the frequency of training (usually determined as number of training session per week) as this requires adding more days to an already busy week. Be it school, work, or family obligations, adding more training sessions is not always a high priority.</p>
<p><strong>How can an athlete increase training frequency given a limited number of training days per week?</strong> Eliminate and Concentrate. Eliminate exercise that you ‘think you should be doing, and Concentrate on the ones you ‘know you should be using in your training.</p>
<p>Prioritize the exercises used in training, in terms of importance to competition, current strength/weakness, degree of transfer, and technical ability…and then <strong>only</strong> perform those exercises listed in the Top 3. Simple as that…</p>
<p>Whatever criteria you use to make your list should be based on your current needs in training. Be it strength, technique, overall performance, recovery, etc., but select only the Top 3 exercises and perform no other exercise for at least 4-weeks. At the end of 4-weeks, re-prioritize your training goals, and reevaluate your list. If your list has changed, so then should your training.</p>
<p>By performing the same 3 exercises at each training session you will increase the frequency at which you perform those exercises but not alter your days of training per week. Whereas before, an athlete who trained up to 12 different exercises in a given week may have only performed each exercise once per week for a total of 4 times in a solid month of training, depending on the number days of training it is possible to eclipse that in only 1-week. The volume and intensity of each exercise may have to be adjusted at each training session (addressed in a future post), but the exercise should be limited to only the Top 3 for that given training cycle.</p>
<p>Obviously this is <strong>not</strong> a long term solution for a number of reasons, but a short term increase in frequency may be enough to continue to produce adaptations. If more days per week are not an option, more exposure to the best exercises should be enough to continue progress.</p>
<p>_<strong>_</strong>____</p>
<p>_I thought this was a fantastic article and would be really helpful to a lot of you. If you have superfluous assistance exercises, this method of stripping them and focusing on the primary lifts for four to six weeks will probably yield impressive results. Discuss in the comments.</p>
<p>–Justin_</p>

  <p>**Note from Editor: There is a new version of this book. Follow <a href="/books/the-texas-method-part-1/">THIS LINK</a> to see it. The links below have been fixed to prevent anyone purchasing the old version. **</p>
<p>All readers on 70’s Big want to get strong, and almost all of them want to get big <em>and</em> strong. They will use a linear progression like Starting Strength or the Greyskull LP, yet seem sort of lost as to what to do next. The Texas Method is typically recommended, yet there isn’t a clear guide on how to transition into it, how to properly progress it, how to tweak it as you advance, or how to use it for sub-goals like weightlifting and swollertrophy. Until now.</p>

  <p>_Typically I don’t like to have too long of a recap for powerlifting and weightlifting meets, but strongman isn’t something I get a lot of recaps on (Paul, I will put yours up soon!). Antigen and ThunderThighs are my pals, and both train together and enjoy competing. Saul’s training and zest for competition reminds me of Gant (and that is high praise). In addition to lifting Antigen is almost nerdy and TT has a vibrant personality — I like these two. Antigen did a full meet recap, and I found it very interesting throughout. Additionally, there are a lot of vids, and I’ve embedded a few. See Antigen’s YouTube Channel for more. The rest is written by Saul.</p>
<p>–Justin_</p>
<p>We competed in our first strongman Saturday April 30. I’m glad I did it but I wouldn’t do it again. (I’ll get to that later) ThunderThighs wants to do one again. It was hosted by a local gym a couple miles from where we live. I mentioned when I was signing up my girlfriend wished she could enter. The next time I was there they told me they’d create a women’s division for her. She was very excited when I brought the news home.</p>
<p>To train we lifted at our regular gym 4 days a week with squats, presses, o-lifts and deadlifts, the usual. We were allowed to train at Los Campeones after paying the entry fee as we had no where else to use the implements. We are really glad they were super super nice to let us do that. The gym owner (Benjamin Loehrer) is pretty cute, TT has a raging crush.</p>
<p>The meet was supposed to be held outside but it was pouring rain the day of so everything was inside. We got soaked on the bike ride there but had extra changes of clothes. Speaking of clothes I wore 3 shirts to minimize the pinching in the Axle continental clean &amp; press, TT wore a tank top (single ply). Soaking wet, I still managed to weigh in as a light weight (&lt;200lbs) but I didn&rsquo;t see my weight. ThunderThighs declined a weigh-in. A friend Tim whom I talked into entering his first meet with an entry fee (by cornering him at work) was MIA that morning. I will continue to bother him until he competes.</p>
<p>**</p></p>
<h2 id="event-1-axle-clean-and-press">Event 1: Axle Clean and Press</h2>
</strong>
<p>[spoiler] The axle is a thick (2.25″) 100lb bar with non revolving sleeves. This makes Olympic clean techniques less useful at heavy weights.</p>
<p>ThunderThighs went first and although she was told it would be the empty bar for max reps, they changed it into max weight. She made 100,110,120 and missed 130’s jerk with no prior practice with continental technique. She was the only female lifting.</p>
<p>The Lightweight men started with 150 on the axle and made 20lb jumps. It was performed last man standing style and competitors had to lift every weight on the way up. I power cleaned and pressed my first 3 attempts but switched to a continental clean and split jerk style so I would be ready for heavy at 210 and up. Some of the 6 lightweights were already eliminated by that point because they were weak and/or didn’t know how to Jerk. The third place lifter was knocked out by 250. I lifted 270 easily but was dreading the pain olympics of continental cleaning even heavier weights. Fortunately the other lifter who had magnetic hands and was power cleaning all his attempts missed at 270 and was knocked out. The 5 heavyweight men started with 200, made 20lb jumps and two lifters failed to get 280, a weight I had continental cleaned in training. It’s disappointing to leave bigger lifts in the tank but there was no incentive for lifts beyond 1st place and continentals damage skin even with 3 shirts.</p>

<h2 id="event-2-atlas-stones-for-height">Event 2: Atlas Stones for Height</h2>
</strong>
<p>[spoiler]The goal was to lift over the axle placed between some squat stands which were raised after each attempt. At maximum extension, the bar was high enough for me to walk under it, I’m 5’7″.</p>
<p>Thunderthighs was never able to lift their lightest atlas stone, 135lb, higher than a few inches off the floor in training. Her substitute was an 85lb sandbag, she was tossing it higher than neck height before she failed.</p>
<p>This event took forever. I had suggested the lightweights use the 235lb stone, but because there were some younger and weaker lifters 190lbs was the starting weight. 3 lifters including myself were able to launch the ball over the 6′ goal after 10+ rounds of lower heights. The tie break was to use the 235lb stone, which continued for several more increases until the tallest guy who also was strong enough to shoulder it won. (Big surprise) I tied for second with a lift around eye height. The heavyweights were able to lift to the same notch as us but started with 235.</p>
<p>I trained for this event improperly because I assumed a heavy stone like 235 or 265 was going to be used so it wouldn’t become a how tall are you contest. So I practiced only with those and even got 265 chest high my third practice session.</p>

<h2 id="event-3-deadlift-medley">Event 3: Deadlift Medley</h2>
</strong>
<p>[spoiler]4 Deadlift stations for time.</p>
<p>TT had a 200lb olympic bar, 100lb DBs, 225 hex bar and 240 axle. She made 240 look easy but it was a 5lb pr for any type of bar.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Mens lightweight had 365 olympic, 200lb suitcases, 425 hex and 455 axle. I got 455 to knee height with very little rest, it was a disappointing miss as I hit 475 two weeks ago in the TSC. I disagreed with the scoring of this event as people who attempted the 4th bar but couldn’t lift clocked a worse time than those who simply quit after station 3. 3 people got it, 2 missed it and 1 didn’t try.</p>
<p>Heavyweights had about 500lbs on the hex and olympic bars, 250lb suitcases, and 530 on the axle which no one was able to successfully lift.</p>

<h2 id="event-4-sandbag-clean-and-press-for-max-reps-in-90s">Event 4: Sandbag Clean and Press for max reps in 90s</h2>
</strong>
<p>[spoiler]This was another event that was switched on us, it was supposed to be Circus Dumbbell Clean and Press for max reps in 90s. The lightweight division was to use the lighter of their two circus DBs but I preferred lifting with the 130lb dumbbell as it was a little more compact and was heavier and had done doubles with it. Then some idiot broke the lighter circus dumbbell the week before the contest so everything was switched to sandbags 85, 120 and 150 for the three divisions.</p>
<p>TT got the bag over her head a couple times but was unable to get a complete lift. The extra upper body involvement controlling the sandbag made 70% not a very good female scale, further hers was the most unstable as it was the least full.</p>
<p>The only sandbag there was to practice with leading up to this event was 85# and it was so light I never touched it again. I had trouble with the rules of this event. First touch and go was not allowed, which I did accidentally once, then another rep that I had actually let go of was wrongly DQ’d. So just a few seconds in I was pissed and two reps behind, so I tried to go as fast as possible by not resetting at my chest. On one “press” (mine were more like snatches) I twisted my left shoulder funny, it hurt pretty bad so I hope I’m not injured. Several more of my reps weren’t counted because it was drooping too much in front of my face and the rule was get your head under at lockout. I <strong>rage quit</strong> with 10 seconds still on the clock I was so disgusted with the event <em>(Editor’s Note: gg)</em>. The top 3 tied at 14 reps. I had 8 which counted and almost as many attempts that did not count.</p>
<p>The best reps for the 150lb heavyweight division sandbag was 6.</p>
<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p>**</p></p>
<h2 id="event-5-farmers-walk-tire-flip-and-keg-carry-race">Event 5: Farmers Walk, Tire Flip and Keg Carry Race</h2>
</strong>
<p>[spoiler]TT used 225 on the trap bar, which is a really impressive load to walk with, being just 20lbs below her new 1rm. She used her best friend (the 85# sandbag) in place of a keg.</p>
<p>Lightweights used the 200lb suitcases. Everyone was tripping on the rubber floor mats while carrying the Keg, including me. I placed second in this event with 40.5s, third place was 41s. The guy who got first did it in 30.0, I’d recommend watching me and then imagine what 35% faster would look like. We’re talking Brent Kim proportions of Dianabol to be able to sprint carrying 400 pounds of weight.</p>
<p>Heavyweights had a 495lb trap bar to walk with and a heavier keg. Everyone that wore a belt found the Keg pretty unwieldy because it would pivot against the buckle I would highly recommend not using one. No one had to set the farmers walk implements down including a 165lb 16 year old. The only people to not actually trip at some point were TT and the lightweight winner.</p>
<p><em>Editor’s Note: After watching this vid, Brent said, “Antigen’s kind of a maniac.”</em></p>

<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p>**</p></p>
<h2 id="event-6-truck-pull">Event 6: Truck Pull</h2>
</strong>
<p>[spoiler] TT’s sub was pushing the owner’s Mini Cooper the same distance the men pulled the truck. This was her first time ever pushing a car, which is really surprising for living in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Grip was a big issue here, we wore rubber gloves but I’m not sure how much it helped. My strategy was to use two arms to get it rolling and then go for speed with one handed pulls but I lost a lot of power from slipping. It turned out using a two handed pull was the best for the conditions. It felt very anticlimactic finishing with an event where you couldn’t tell who was faster or slower from watching and no one was able to pull their hardest.</p>

<p>Overall I placed third, the tall dude second and the dianabol dude first. For this I won 1 month of gym membership to <a href="http://www.loscampeonesgym.com/">Los Campeones</a>.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t do another competition because I don’t feel that strongman as well refined a sport as Powerlifting or Weightlifting (or even the TSC). Many of the events did not challenge the limit strength or power of any of the competitors, including Keg carry, tire flipping, and sandbag presses. If strongman is the title the implements shouldn’t be light enough that everyone who enters can lift them! Since I did not know the weights and distances ahead of time and some of the events were changed on us it wouldn’t meet Justin’s definition of sport either. /blog/2011/04/sport/ The scoring of the deadlift medley, especially for the heavyweights introduced substantial random noise into the scoring. For them the winner was the person who took the least time to realize he couldn’t lift the 530 axle not who completed the first 3 lifts fastest. Finishing place in stones for height was like sorting us by height after accounting for physical ability to lift the 235. In events where lifters tied for the same place they could have broke the tie by bumping the lighter lifter ahead but they had ties stand. But I don’t like the sum of placings scoring in general because it does not reward any effort beyond what gets 1st and can make the least bad athlete win instead of the strongest overall.</p>
<p>Despite that I’d still recommend trying a strongman contest if you are an intermediate with competitive experience and want to shake up your training. It’s probably more fun than a Crossfit competition and if you’re the strongest you just might win. If you’ve never competed: a powerlifting or weightlifting meet is a safer bet because you’ll be able to practice all the lifts of the competition and know the rules ahead of time.</p>

  <p>PR Friday. Post training updates and PRs to comments.</p>
<p>I have a friend who is in the Army. To date, he’s been in over three years of combat deployment. Before his last deployment he went to Ranger School, a grueling 61 day combat leadership course that is known for a lack of sleep and calories. It’s typically the most difficult thing an American soldier will ever do. It’s not uncommon to lose 40 pounds in this course. All of the students don’t fantasize about women or a hot shower…they fantasize about food. Very elaborate things like Oreos dipped in chocolate or a Snickers ice-cream bar that is halfway thawed out, wrapper sweating with condensation. At the end of the course — assuming the student doesn’t get hurt or voluntarily quit — the new Ranger not only gets to eat a shit load of food, but he gets to have the Ranger tab placed on his shoulder. It must be one of the most powerful moments in their lives knowing that they accomplished this unbearable, rigorous task. Once that tab was on my friend’s shoulder, do you know what he did? He picked his eyes up, looked forward, and said, “What’s next?”</p>
<p>My friend had a goal set before him: pass Ranger school. Never quit. Once he completed that goal, it took him approximately two seconds before he pushed towards the next goal. Getting complacent in training is a curse, something that makes you soft. You are never good enough, strong enough. The moment you think you have “enough” of whatever it is you think you have — you have failed. The moment you think there isn’t anything left to improve — you have failed. Attack your training, and attack your weaknesses. Avoiding something because you aren’t good at it? Looks like you’ve gone soft, my friend. Strive ardently to improve; it isn’t enough to complete your training as if you were clocking in and out of work. Instead, tear open its rib cage, rip out its still beating heart, and consume it like a dangerous, dangerous animal.</p>
<p>What the fuck have you done lately? It doesn’t matter; you could be better.</p>

  <p>The summer is open for doing workshops around the country and potentially the world. There are now two different kinds of workshops that 70’s Big presents:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming workshops</li>
</ol>
<p>These workshops have a focus on learning the fundamentals of programming strength, conditioning, and then a combination thereof. These workshops also include a “lift around” where attendees can get form checks, learn a new movement, or practice coaching.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Lifting workshops</li>
</ol>
<p>This type of workshop is more focused on the lifting. After a brief fundamentals lecture on equipment (especially belt use), mechanics, and prehab/rehab/mobility for lifters, the day is focused on lifting. All lifts are fair game: squat, press, bench, deadlift, snatch, and clean and jerk. The gym owner and/or attendees will dictate what lifts are included, but the stock plan is to get work on the strength lifts.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to combine these workshops for a two day weekend event. If you are interested in hosting a workshop, e-mail <a href="mailto:justin@70sbig.com">Justin@70sbig.com</a>. If you want to attend a workshop and want to campaign for 70’s Big to come to your city, shoot an e-mail (it will help if you have a place in mind or know someone who is interested in hosting). Please note that tank-tops, facial hair, aviator sunglasses, beer, and meat will be a constant presence in these workshops.</p>
<p><strong>Denver, June 8</strong></p>
<p>There will be a Lifting Workshop in Denver, CO at <a href="http://www.crossfitlodo.com/">CrossFit LoDo</a> on Saturday, June 8th, 2011. A full schedule with details will be released soon.</p>
<p><strong>Australia</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been working with my mate on getting a workshop in Sydney, Australia. We are going to tentatively plan a date in July, but need to gauge interest before spending money on travel. We will have a “registration” (with no payment) process until June. If we don’t get enough people by then, we’ll call it off. If we do, then we’ll finalize the schedule for the workshop a month later. E-mail <a href="mailto:justin@70sbig.com">Justin@70sbig.com</a> if you are an Aussie who is interested.</p>
<h2 id="videos-you-should-see">Videos You Should See</h2>
<p>Most of these vids are old, but impressive. Weightlifting doesn’t get enough attention on this site.</p>
<p>World record snatch in training, 202.5kg:</p>

<p>AC and I were laughing about this chick’s vids. Feel free to pick it apart. We aren’t just assholes, so tell me what is wrong with her teaching, the lift, and the mechanics. Then go back to being an asshole.</p>

  <p>I’ve always been interested in talk radio and wanted to start doing podcasts. They will allow me to interview various people and get the information to you succinctly. I aim for my podcasts to be short and to the point — no more than 15 minutes. As always, I aim to inform, educate, and entertain. To get my feet wet, the first <strong>70’s Big Podcast</strong> is with our own AC. AC is a young, raw powerlifter who has won several meets and has benched a paused 380 at 212 lbs. We discuss various topics like his training history, karate chops to the throat, and why he’s on such a power trip lately.</p>
