  <p><em>Here is a post by Brent that he wrote for his training blog. You can find his site <a href="/shrugthug">HERE</a>. Everyone here at 70’s Big loves Kelly Starrett, and Brent probably wishes Kelly was his dad. Go to <a href="http://mobilitywod.com">MobilityWOD.com</a> for a daily mobility video.</em></p>
<p>I started out with a shitty overhead position and 0 degrees internal rotation. Couldn’t get the bar behind my ears without hyperextending my lumbar spine. Couldn’t keep the bar close in the snatch because I had 0 internal rotation. Benching often hurt.</p>
<p>I’ve always leaned on a lacrosse ball to roll on sore spots on the anterior capsule of my shoulder joint, but the 3 mobs that I did early on that helped like, 30-40% were:</p>
<p>1.) <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2010/11/episode-79365-best-shoulder-mob-ever.html">Drive humerus towards back of socket, lateral distraction, external rotation</a>. This is the least painful of what I did. I still do this for bench prep and sometimes front rack prep.</p>
<p>2.) <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/03/episode-209365-free-your-ribs-your-mind-will-follow.html">Restoring rib/scap/external rotator movement, lacrosse ball between t-spine and scap, reach overhead, then freestyle to whatever hurt and roll on them until they hurt less</a>. This caused spasming in places I wasn’t touching early on, was really tight apparently. See also <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/01/episode-155365-periscapular-regional.html">this informed free-styling</a>.</p>
<p>3.) Internal rotation stretching. <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2010/11/episode-89365-bro-your-internal.html">Buddy stretch was super legit early on</a>, these days I rely on <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-229365-shoulder-internal-rotation-i-has-it.html">band around shoulder with extension/adduction</a> as a mainstay.</p>
<p>Some other things that helped me pretty significantly were:</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/01/episode-153365-olympic-lifiting.html">Double lacrosse ball to t-spine</a>, this was one of the last pieces to legitimizing my overhead position.</p>
<p>– Rolling on the external rotators that wrapped around the humerus, i.e. lateral part of the shoulder and then towards the front. Had to get in creative positions, but I think this helped with some generic shoulder tightness that affected my benching and overhead position. See informed free-styling video regarding periscapular regional death above.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-212365-pain-ball-calling-all-shoulders-over.html">Rolling on pec minor/pec insertion</a>. Made going overhead easier. May have helped with internal rotation?</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/02/episode-185365-improving-jump-mechanism.html">Hip flexor/quad stretch</a>. Couldn’t go completely upright until my 3rd or 4th exposure, but this definitely legitimized my hip extension in the snatch and clean.</p>
<p>– Anything involving external rotation of the femur with hip flexion. My deadlift feels a lot different now, in a good way, feels like I’m utilizing more musculature in the movement. Squat bottom position feels more legit. I used to feel tight before but weak coming out of the hole, now I feel looser but stronger driving out of the hole. Improving end range function means greater force production?</p>
<p>– Most recent addition has been <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-226365-recovering-your-overheadpressing-shoulders-after-workout-4.html">banding the elbows together, get a wide-as-possible supinated grip on a pull up bar, then slowly load the movement with a neutral spine</a>. Absolutely noticed a difference snatching today. Gonna try it before a heavy jerk/overhead press day and see how it feels.</p>

<p>Something that Kstar and other sources/people have mentioned is you can’t address mobility in isolation; i.e. if your shoulder function sucks, you can’t just do shoulder mobs and expect to get a lot better. Have to address movement as a whole, shoulders and hips are analogs to each other, I don’t fucking know, I just do every mob ok? My life fucking sucks and I am taking it one step at a time to try to make it better. Sometimes that means laying on a lacrosse ball every night. Other times it may mean wrapping a band around a limb or perhaps asphyxiating yourself while masturbating, while injecting nandralone.</p>
<p>Another guideline is, “you have to find where you are tight.” The mobs that helped me may not help you that much, but you may discover shit that really hurts to do that might be related. Do the shit that really hurts to do.</p>
<p>There’s probably shit that I don’t even know that I need to address. Basically I check the site and do the mwod and if it hurts or is difficult for me to do, I incorporate it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>[edit 9:13pm 4.23.11] – <em>I was asked to link the mobs that I like to do. Really the best thing to do if you are looking for shit to do is test/re-test, which Kstar generously has for each mob that he posts a day. If your shit sucks for a certain test, do the mob. I’ve provided my history and how I approached my particular problems. In all honesty, I’d probably see a lot more benefit if I could see a PT of Kelly Starrett’s breed and get guidance from there. I move better now, but there are still some gaping holes in how “healthy” I should be.</em></p>

  <p><em>Monday is 70’s Big Females day, presenting:</em></p>
<p><strong>Growing Up Oly</strong></p>
<p>by Cori Safe</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have had the opportunity to grow up in a strong, loving, and quintessential “70’s Big” community since birth. While we did not define it as 70’s Big, looking back I think we can name it as such. This is a story about growing up in the strength world.</p>
<p>One of my earliest memories from childhood is from my play pen. I remember sitting there watching my mom pound away at the stationary bicycle day in and day out. Obviously working on her six pack and getting ready for her next bodybuilding competition. I remember squats. Big squats. Powerlifting style with large men grunting, steel plates and bars banging against the floor and the racks. I remember my dad kicking a hole through the gym wall after a heavy squat. My brother and I would scoot our big wheels through our garage gym while friends of my parents would do endless pullups, deadlifts, and bicep curls. Yes, I grew up in a powerlifting and bodybuilding gym.</p>
<p>Luckily, my father Scott Safe (founder of Safe USA and coach of Team Cannon Weightlifting) learned from years of dealing with his own back pain and agony that competitive powerlifting was probably not the best way to train for sport or health. He had a different idea for his children. My brother and I were going to be Olympic lifters. And the plan was that we would be really, really freaking amazing at sports. Not to sound arrogant, but it worked.</p>

<p>As my father held an inventory for his weightlifting supply store, my brother and I would have free reign to the bars and plates in the shop after school. I remember playing with the “kid bar” around the age of 9 and thinking how empowering it was to power snatch. I absolutely loved how loud and annoying I could be. My father would say, “Okay that looks good, now try to take that snatch into the hole!” I would practice this afterschool until the age of ten when I decided that it was time for me to do my first weightlifting meet; The Minnesota LWC Open at a YWCA in Minneapolis. I was ready to show off my 20kg snatch with perfect technique, all the way into the hole. I stepped on the platform and completely forgot about the squat. My dad had told me prior to the meet that if I did not squat the weight, the judges would give me red lights. Of course, that is not correct, but he wanted me to lift correctly and I did not know any better. After my first snatch which I powered right up I said, “Hey dad, they gave it to me and I didn’t even have to squat!” He laughed and told me that I was correct and that he was just trying to get me to do it better than the other girls. Then, of course, I squat snatched from that moment on. <em>Must be better than the other girls</em>!</p>
<p>Speaking of, I remember showing up at meets and thinking that I needed to show these other girls who was the better lifter. I would take the bar during warm ups and be as loud as possible. When I would catch the bar, I would smack my feet down like it was serious business. (I realize that you should not be jumping and stomping, but you have to realize that my thinking as a teen was not about having perfect technique.) It always worked. Girls would stare at me, filled with fear and intimidation. Win!</p>
<p>Luckily, we always had a large competitive weightlifting team coached by my father. One of my biggest influences was my brother Nate and his circle of friends, all of which were excellent lifters. Not many girls wanted to lift with me, but the guys would always let me play. I would watch my brother finish his pull and explosively land the heaviest weights with ease. I would play copycat. I will credit having good technique to years of watching my brother and his friends and learning from them. It also proves how important it is to have good training partners and people to look up to.</p>

    At the 2004 Olympic Trials
  </p>
</div>
<p>After my brother graduated high school, he moved to Fargo to play football for North Dakota State University. He used his strength and power to become one of the best college left tackles in the nation. After he left, I struggled with my training. I didn’t want to lift and I did not feel that training was fun or inspiring anymore. I still ended up competing nationally and doing the Olympic trials for weightlifting in 2004, but I never felt the same about lifting. During the Olympic trials I acquired a bad case of Mono and was out for months.</p>
<p>I tried lifting again in college. We even started a team at the University of Wisconsin – La Crosse. There were a handful of us training together and we took a team to the Collegiate Nationals in Reno. I coached the team and lifted. Even still, my drive for weightlifting was dwindling. I was mentally burned out. So, I retired.</p>
<p>I took a few years off and I spent my weightlifting hiatus doing cardiotard classes like TurboKick, Zumba, and riding endless hours on the Elliptical machine trying to be skinny. Time to face the truth. My quads and shoulders are big. And strong. They are not meant to be compared to the twig fairy. They are 70’s Big. And beautiful.</p>
<p>Mentally, I was ready to lift again. I was ready to embrace the fact that I was born to lift. I was living in Chicago and wanted to lift and try this thing called CrossFit. A good friend of mine, Casey Burgener, suggested I check out Windy City CrossFit because they have an “Oly” program. GREAT! I can try out CrossFit and if I fail….I can just go back to lifting! While I will admit that I will probably never win a CrossFit championship, it has been great to push myself in new ways that I probably wouldn’t have done on my own. It is also nice to learn about other lifts besides the snatch and clean and jerk. And this thing called the pull up – moving my body around a bar rather than moving the bar around my body! What a concept! Anyway, I am not poking fun at CrossFit, but it is nice to have a balance between CrossFit and Oly lifting. It has helped me define my weaknesses (arms/shoulders/”core”) and strengthening these can only help my Olympic lifting.</p>

<p>And here we are today. Ellee and I both lift in Chicago and we are proud of our 70’s Big Female Asses! I feel good knowing that strength is appreciated in these parts. Again, I will say that I am lucky to be in a community full of strong females (and males) who believe that strength is more important that being skinny. I am lucky to have been in these types of communities my entire life.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed some of my stories from growing up Oly. I would like to thank my parents, brother, and friends who have molded me into the person that I am today. Thank you. 70’s Big Females – thank YOU for being YOU! Now go lift some heavy weights!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Cori</p>

  <p>Getting <a href="/blog/2011/04/stronger/">stronger</a> is a process that demands that you get <a href="/blog/2011/04/smarter/">smarter</a> by learning from mistakes. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? You just go to the gym, have a “workout”, get strong, occasionally mess up, but fix it and keep “working out”…right?</p>
<p>No, sir. The process of training is grueling. It can be fun when training with friends, pumping loud music, having a grand ol’ time. But for most of us, we don’t get that luxury. We’re in a gym, a garage, or a “fitness adventure”…alone with our thoughts. There isn’t anyone there to encourage crushing the first set of squats or to hit a sixth snatch in a row. Each set, each rep requires that you make a decision: “Do I give it my all here?” Doing it on every rep isn’t easy.</p>
<p>It would be pretty easy to not try. It would be easy to slack on some reps, to not bounce the hell out of a squat or not finish the pull on your cleans. Sure, it’d be easy. It’d be so easy to quit. It’s much easier to quit than do something hard, so why bother?</p>
<p>Fuck. That. Never avoid doing something that’s hard. Avoiding “hard” makes you a coward, and you can never experience or learn anything by being a coward. By convincing yourself to do something that’s hard when you don’t want to, you won’t just grow physically. You display a quality of strength that correlates and resonates far beyond the barbell. By overcoming the difficult, that process sets you up for success. Your thoughts formulate your feelings, your feelings compose your emotions, your emotions are exhibited through your actions, and your actions define who you are. By structuring your thoughts to tackle difficult challenges, to strive towards success regardless of the obstacle, you formulate into a better person. You manifest into 70’s Big.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the participants and congratulations to MaceJunas (Men’s Elite winner), tommcadam (Men’s open winner), and mthornell (Women’s Open winner). Also congratulations to Men’s Elite runner up Antigen — who organized this 70’s Big TSC and compiled all the results — for tying an all-time TSC record of 24 pull-ups with a 10kg load. I believe Antigen was at an organized TSC event, so he had some strict judging.</p>

<p>Glenn Pendlay joined the 70’s Big Chat the other night for longer than he probably wanted to. He had some interesting comments on “macro weightlifting” — or things that concern the sport as a whole and how we compare with the rest of the world. One topic in particular was this notion that American weightlifting coaches don’t focus on strength. Glenn kindly pointed out in <a href="http://www.pendlayforum.com/showthread.php?p=11723#post11723">this post</a> that it isn’t the case. Max Aita aimed to do 5×5 with 260kg. That’s fucking 572 lbs. Glenn points out that “he doesn’t quite make it, but ends up doing 27 total reps in 7 total sets, rep counts were 4,5,4,4,4,3,3.” The video gets fucking intense, so watch all the way through.</p>

<p>As an aside, here’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVemvcVLPHQ">Donny Shankle push-pressing</a> 130kg for 11 reps from behind the neck. That’s 286 pounds. More on this topic in a future podcast with Glenn.</p>

  <p><em>Still adding links below to the recaps</em></p>
<p>Some of the 70’s Big crew competed in the USAPL Texas State Meet again this year. Mike competed at USAPL Military Nationals a couple of weeks before, so he handled Brent, Alex (his brother), and Chris at the meet. He wanted to do a write up for each portion, and they are linked below.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wp.me/PEKxw-12j">The Ride Down</a></strong></p>
<p>The ride from Wichita Falls to San Antonio was arguably eventful, but more so because of the lack of organization. Mike tells an amusing story of the ride.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wp.me/PEKxw-12m">Brent</a></strong></p>
<p>Brent ended squatting with a meet PR (and matching a gym PR) of 210kg (463 lbs) weighing around 162. He missed his third bench, and hit all three deadlifts finishing at 200kg (441 lbs) on the last one (he was unimpressed). I want to point out that the dickhead did clean and jerks two days before the meet at 265 pounds…with iron plates. He clearly didn’t make any attempt to peak for this meet.</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="368" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1LP2h9gCir8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><strong><a href="http://wp.me/PEKxw-12r">Alex</a></strong></p>
<p>This was Alex’s first meet, and came out 8/9 with a 242.5kg (533 lbs) squat, an easy 165kg (363 lbs) bench, and an easy 227.5kg (500 lbs) deadlift (Mike probably held him back, wanting him to pull 500 for the first time).</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="368" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kb57fJVkXYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><strong><a href="http://wp.me/PEKxw-12u">Chris</a></strong></p>
<p>Chris had an awesome meet. We’ve talked a lot on tweaking his program and peaking his training for this meet, and we also talked extensively on what attempts to make on each lift. The only hiccup was missing the third attempt bench by 2.5kg because he barely missed it, but that is more so attributed to the not-great meet conditions (they had 90 lifters and one platform, so Alex and Chris didn’t start lifting until late afternoon and finished close to 9 at night). Overall, I think we did a very good job of implementing an advanced Texas Method style program, tapered it well, and chose the attempts well.</p>
<p>He went 8/9, squatted an overall PR of 292.5kg (644 lbs), missed his last bench but meet PR’d with 165kg (363 lbs) on the second attempt, and deadlifted an overall PR of 300kg (661 lbs). All raw and drug-free of course. He then destroyed several villages.</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="368" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7GHDyhk2rOQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Good job to Mike for handling the three lifters — it’s never an easy thing. Mike was apparently more tired after doing that then when he actually lifts. I’ll make sure and be there for all of them at nationals later this year. Oh, and thanks to Mike for the write ups and I think he and Alex made the vids.</p>

  <p><em>Recap by Mike</em></p>
<p>We woke up and made it to the meet around 6:45am. Although this wouldn’t be the case for the rest of the day, everything went quite smooth. Brent, Alex, and Chris all weighed in, got their racks heights, and had their equipment checked in, in the span on 20 minutes. We were back outside heading to Cracker Barrel (two minutes from the meet), by 7:10am. Brent and I scoped out the area the night prior (something Justin suggested we do at our first meet in 2010), and had a backup plan as well, just in case things didn’t go well. Thankfully they did, and we had plenty of time for a solid breakfast. I don’t know why, but the Cracker Barrels that I had eaten prior to moving to Texas are not nearly as good as their restaurants here. All of us ate a hearty meal, and Brent knocked over the lamp at the table, and in made a dramatic crash on the ground. Mission accomplished, we left another restaurant in better shape than when we got there. We arrived back around 8:30am for the “rules brief” which was mainly so that we could clarify if we would get yelled at again about not having our thumbs around the bar while squatting. They told us they didn’t care. For the next thirty minutes we tried to figure out what the flights were, and then it was announced that there were two sessions. This meant Alex and Chris lifted in the afternoon. AWESOME.</p>
<p>The lifting began around 9:15a.m, and since Brent was in the third flight it was still going to take a minute. Brent started warming up during the 2nd attempts of the 2nd flight. Brent felt and looked really good, and although he hadn’t squatted more than 435 or 440 since he dropped to 165, I was confident he’d be good to match his previous 210k (463lbs) PR. This would also break the state record, which had been 457. Once Brent was warm, he sat down around 10 minutes out from his first attempt. I’d like to point out now that in a normal setting, Brent is hard to handle. During the meet however, he was quite calm, and doesn’t really display much emotion. I again reiterated to him that he didn’t have a soul.</p>
<p>We went as planned and had Brent opened with a conservative 190k (419lbs). It was an easy first attempt, but not the best bounce I’ve ever seen out of him. He’s normally quite explosive, so I told him about this, and wasn’t even told to f*** off. We jumped up to 200k (441lbs) and sat him down. It took quite a while to get through the countless geared high school lifters, but we eventually got to Brent’s second attempt. It looked slightly better than the first attempt, but still a little bit of a grinder. Although I thought it would be hard, this was Brent, and I was confident he would deliver on the third attempt. He knew it would be hard, but as long as he stuck with it, it was going to go. We called for an attempt to break the state record for 165 pound raw males, and went for 210k (463lbs). Brent walked it out (much faster than he used to, even when he was heavier), and got a solid bounce out of the bottom. He knew it would have to stick with it if he didn’t want a repeat of Nationals (he missed 215k last year), and nailed it. Brent had a BS red light for his underwear last year at Texas State, then missed 215k last year, so this was the first time he went 3/3 on the squat.</p>
<p>There was going to be a lot of time before Brent benched, so we left for Jack n the Box to get a midday meal, which would unfortunately be our last until nearly 12 hours later. After recreating Terminator 2 while standing there waiting for our food (the woman there was amused, and I say that because at least she didn’t call the cops) we headed back. It took us forty minutes to take a 3 minute drive to get food. When we got back, the first flight was just finishing benching, as I expected. There was plenty of time for Brent to eat before he started warming up for the Bench. He made a comment about “I don’t f*<strong>*</strong> need high fructose corn syrup” but otherwise sat and ate quietly. It’s probably a good idea to mention now that Brent strained his right shoulder recently, and was doing a number of mobility wods each time to try and ensure he could recover as fast as possible. He told me it felt pretty good after warming up, so we decided to stick with the plan. We opened at a conservative 112.5k (248lbs), and Brent blew it up, easy style. You’ll appreciate his commentary after the lift, but it was still easy. We bumped it up 10k to 122.5k (270lbs) and he grinded through it. It was tougher than I expected, but Brent told me he really didn’t think we push driving with his heels. We decided to still go for a personal PR, and went for 127.5k (281 lbs). Much like we’ve all felt before, the bar just wasn’t going anywhere; Brent was out of gas for 281lbs. I know he was disappointed, but this was a much leaner Brent Kim (165 vs his previous 181) and I’m confident he’ll be good for 300lbs shortly. My goal was just to focus on the deadlift.</p>
<p>Brent admitted he was quite tired so I sent Alex and Chris to get all of us some frappes from McDonald’s, and get outside for a bit. When they got back 30 minutes later they seemed more frustrated than before (the opposite of what I wanted), and the coffee was straight dog crap. Brent started warming up shortly after, and around 315 I noticed the bar was coming away from him. I’ll go ahead and attribute it to fatigue, but regardless, I knew he needed that cue when it came to making sure he hit all three deadlifts. Much like Justin had me do at Military Nationals, we opened with Brent’s last warm-up of 180k (397lbs), to get a feel for the bar on the platform. The first attempt looked easy, and we went with the planned jump to 195k (430lbs). The bar came away from Brent on this one, and it was a tough lift. Although it was hard, I wanted Brent to go for a little more, and I knew if he kept it close he’d have it. We decided on 200k (441lbs) as opposed to the 205k (452lbs) we had planned for. Brent got a little livelier for this one, but I knew for sure he didn’t want to miss anything else. 441lbs was on the bar, and there was never a doubt he had it. Brent kept the bar much closer on this pull, and it looked far easier than 441lbs. Brent ended up going 8/9, and although he wasn’t really impressed, he was 15 pounds lighter, much leaner, and has room to fill out before Nationals. I’m confident he will smash all his PR’s in August, but unfortunately our day was far from over.</p>

  <p>It’s no secret that bacon was a gift from the immortals. Zeus, Cronus’ son, showed the Lifterians the great secret of bacon several years after Priam’s Troy fell. He said onto the Lifterians, “Go forth and eat bacon, for it is thy life source. And when you shall sacrifice to us, the mighty immortals, may you do it with delicious crispy bacon lest your prayers go irritatingly ignored. I bow my head to you now, Lifterians, binding our pact for eternity.” And so it was that the unfathomable was fathomable, and bacon was upon our green lands.</p>

<p>Let it be known that all bits of bacon should be consumed, lest it insult mighty, terrible Zeus. Do not dispose of bacon grease; Apollo himself, the shall rain his flurry of arrows upon the backs of such wasteful fools. Cook thine eggs in the grease of bacon for superior results.</p>
<p>Rumors have been heard in crowded streets that bacon was actually the offspring of powerful Zeus and loving Aphrodite. This explains why bacon has such a powerful, passionate, and loving attraction.</p>
<p>Now fire up the grill, the stove, the oven, and griddle,</p>
<p>Light the match, grab the pan, and place the bacon in the middle.</p>
<p>Let it snap, let it pop, let the aromas climb</p>
<p>For all of your friends will know that it is bacon time.</p>

  <h2 id="confessions-of-a-recovering-cardio-junkie">Confessions of a Recovering Cardio Junkie</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>By Ellee for the weekly 70&#8217;s Big Females installment</em><br />
</p>
<p>Today’s post is not about lifting nor not asses. Sorry. In fact, this message isn’t really intended for the enlightened 70’s Big reader. It’s designed to be an intervention for all the beloved female cardio addicts. I understand that Justin has covered this topic in the past, but perhaps a woman-to-woman talk is in order.</p>
<p>As discussed in previous posts, Cori was groomed from a very early age to be a competitive Olympic weightlifter. I, on the other hand, studied classical ballet throughout my entire childhood and teenage years. In a young girl, this dance training instills agility, discipline, elegance and the desire to be really. really. fucking skinny. As an adult, this desire remained and I turned to hardcore cardio abuse. Diet was definitely part of it, but my appetite for skinny has always been overshadowed by my thirst for beer and passion for baked goods. Quality tapeworms are hard to come by in this day and age, but treadmills are plentiful!</p>
<p>I understand that the upcoming admission may significantly detract from my appeal in the eyes of the 70’s Big community, but I am willing to take the hit for the sake of the greater good. Before I discovered the benefits of the heavy barbell . . . I instructed droves of women in cardio dance classes at big-box gyms across the city of Chicago. In addition to teaching these classes, I would spend 90 minutes everyday climbing the stairmaster only to arrive absolutely nowhere I wanted to be. This type of monotonous, machine-based “training” is miserable and isolating. If you currently have a similar regimen and are not yet prepared to acknowledge that it sucks, you are still in the denial phase.</p>
<p>After keeping up with this horrendous routine for years, I started to look as if I had partied through the decades with Keith Richards. Don’t get me wrong, I love Keith Richards, but his appearance shouldn’t be simulated by any woman. As if looking strung out wasn’t bad enough, I was a total weakling. I attempted to broaden my horizons by attending a yoga class during which we were cued to slowly lower ourselves from the planche position. Naturally, this attempted maneuver resulted in an catastrophic, ego-shattering pushup FAIL. I glared at the instructor with a helpless sort of hate in my eyes thinking “this bitch is specifically and maliciously trying to kill me!” This was rock-bottom. It was time to reassess my training strategy.</p>
<p>Despite my 30’s “Great Depression” weak physique, I was able to pull myself from the Cardio Inferno (it is the lesser known 10th Circle of Hell that is lined with ellipticals and 18 year old trainers selling spray tans). It took some time for the paradigm shift to be fully realized and to unlearn everything that I had always revered as gospel. I am proud to say that I eventually kicked the deleterious cardio habit and have been clean for two years now.</p>
<p>I would now like to take this opportunity to humbly apologize to all the ladies out there. You have been fooled; I was, too. As a group exercise instructor, I never had a diabolical agenda to make you frail and weak. I was simply fed the same pernicious pseudo-fitness garbage that you were. The time has come for you to redirect the energy that you are putting into your current workouts in a way that is actually conducive to getting you the results that you desire. A life spent on those machines is filled with pointless and endless masturbatory pain. And you sure as hell will not be molding the ass you have always dreamed of! Find a good coach and a strong community of supporters that will encourage you along your journey to become a stronger woman.</p>
<p>Females, please comment on how embracing the lifestyle of a beautiful 70’s Big Female has improved you both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>Adult males, please share this post with the ladies in your life. However, I will advise you NOT to attempt to coach your own wives/girlfriends. Such behavior is sure to result in sex-withholding, which is massively detrimental to both parties. Opt for a third-party trainer instead and continue to get your groove on.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Ellee</p>

  <p>Chalk floats softly through the air. The thumping of your heart is all you hear, all you feel. You step to the bar and place your hands on it, feeling the cold knurling on callused hands. The whirling hurricane of emotion settles into the eye of the storm, the peaceful moment when you have to make a decision to begin.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>If you’ve found yourself on the receiving end of an ass kicking by gravity, I can feel your disappointment, irritation, and likely rage. Missing reps is common among lifting, yet dealing with them is not. Powerlifters can go months without missing a single rep to experience the ultimate let down on a third attempt. Weightlifters who push themselves will miss in each workout, but it <a href="/blog/2011/04/stronger/">doesn’t make it any easier</a>. After the initial moments of rage quiet down, remember that each missed rep is a learning opportunity.</p>
<p>The process of getting <a href="/blog/2011/04/stronger/">stronger</a> is dependent on how you react to failure, and failure will be prevalent. In order to get stronger, you have to get smarter, and you get smarter by analyzing what went wrong, how to fix it, and doing it better next time. This may require a hard look at aspects of recovery (food, sleep, etc.), the program (levels of volume intensity throughout the week and over time), and the technique (inefficiencies in movement and bar path). The possibility may exist that you didn’t have any business attempting that weight, but you won’t know until you try. There’s always a reason for failure, but it’s up to you (and the coach) to figure out why. Otherwise you won’t get smarter about getting stronger.</p>

  <p>Sports are an incredibly important contributor to human nature in our pussified society. The lack of responsibility and risk taking swells to the point where people avoid any kind of competitive activity because of the inherent risk of failure. Participating in sport at any level will replace the necessary competitive edge in an individual and kindle the fire of dedication, hard work, and almost reckless intensity; the stuff of 70’s Big.</p>
<p>But what is a sport? We have the Shrug Thug to inform us about the activities that aren’t a sport (geared lifting, calculus, or fixing a pair of glasses), but what qualifies something to sport status? I always consider sport to encompass the following:</p>
<p>**– Individuals or groups participating in a sanctioned competition that has a standard set of rules for achieving victory.</p>
<p>– The competitors (who are human) exhibit physicality**</p>
<p>The highlight of the first portion of the definition is “sanction”. Regarding the competitive events, this implies that the type of event, how it is officiated, and how victory can be attained are all inherently known before hand. American football has a rigid set of rules and is played indoors our outdoors, yet it’s known where the game will be played and to what standards the players must perform. Strongman competitions are sanctioned events in that the federation indicates that each competition will have a given number of categories and the types of events that are permitted in each category. The “meet director” in this case will choose the required events from this list and lists them on the registration form. Not only are there x amount of events in y amount of categories, but they are known when the athlete signs up for the event. This is in contrast to CrossFit which is self described as “random”. This doesn’t aim to bash CrossFit, but it’s intentional lack of congruity removes it from the discussion of qualifying as a sport, given the above definition. (I’ve also heard adamant CFers try and make the point that it isn’t any different than strongman competitions, and if strongman is a sport, then CF must be to. Again, since strongman has a rigid method of creating competitions from a pool of listed events (types of pressing, types of deadlifing, types of carrying, etc.), then it is most definitely sanctioned — and thus a sport — while the random CF competition is not.)</p>

    Rugby is a sport

<p>Having a standard for achieving victory is obviously important. Victory in sport is inherently not subjective. Basketball, American football, hockey, and baseball all have a point system. When the game ends and your team has more points, you win. Gymnastics and diving are a bit different, yet those judges have a defined set of criteria that they look for in a performance — the fact that we have never cared to look to see what that criteria is doesn’t mean they are judging randomly. This would indicate that cheerleading competitions qualify as a sport while the sideline rah-rah obviously does not.</p>
<p>The second part of the definition is debatable. I think it’s fair to refer specifically to human competitors when discussing sport; I always get pissed when horse racing, chess, or poker is on ESPN (although they do it because it makes them money). Human competitors would also imply that NASCAR, while beloved among plenty of Americans, is not a sport (motor sport is more fitting anyway). However, requiring that “physicality” is necessary for sport status becomes a quantification problem. The term physicality (or the requirement of physical exertion in the competition) is too vague and hard to quantify; I deem this the hole in the definition. Changing this definition would merely serve the definer to eliminate or accept activities that he considers a sport, and that’s not how definitions are made. Nevertheless, I consider it an important distinction; if there was some sort of physicality quantification, then things like golf, darts, or catfish noodling would be reduced to a game or hobby.</p>
<p>Quantification requires a measurement so that there is an objective distinction in what you intend to say. “Physicality” must be measurable, and the only way I can think to do that is with caloric expenditure relative to the size of an athlete (perhaps a percentage of the basal metabolic rate). If it isn’t done internally, then it must be done with rate of movement. Nevertheless it isn’t something we can implement, but will instead have to debate.</p>
<p>By competing in a sport, as defined above, the competitor is deemed an athlete. People who do not compete in sport are not an athlete, and instead should be considered a trainee (assuming they train). This doesn’t mean that the trainee isn’t athletic, yet athlete is quantified as a sport competitor. This also doesn’t imply that athletes themselves are athletic; there are certain bowlers, golfers, or even some baseball players who aren’t exactly athletic (calling golf and bowling a sport is debatable — see “physicality” quantification above). If someone has played sports previously in their life, are they still considered an athlete? I’m not the one to make that distinction, but if it were up to me I’d say “no” unless they were paid to compete in a sport and still train. In any case, “athlete” is a distinction for a sport competitor. This would eliminate catfish noodlers and CrossFitters alike from “athlete” status. This doesn’t mean they aren’t athletic, yet given the quantifiable definition above, it makes the distinction black and white.</p>
<p>Feel free to debate this topic in the comments. If you’re going to improve my definition or change my mind, you’ll have to provide a dose of logic as I’ve tried to do here. Debating what is or isn’t a sport may be fun, but 70’s Big is primarily interested in getting you to funnel your training into sport whether it be powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting, rugby, or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnXh3XR9zyM">bat fighting</a>. Besides, you’re just a trainee until you do.</p>
