  <p>A while back we had some demographic polls to find out that 70’s Big was a big fucking sausage fest. Hopefully it isn’t…as much. In any case, partake in the polls. If you have any suggestions for today’s group of polls, put them in the comments.</p>
<p>[poll id=”19″]</p>
<p>[poll id=”20″]</p>
<p>[poll id=”21″]</p>
<p>[poll id=”22″]</p>
<p>[poll id=”23″]</p>
<p>[poll id=”24″]</p>
<p>[poll id=”25″]</p>
<p>[poll id=”26″]</p>
<p>[poll id=”27″]</p>
<p>Real sports are ‘competitions’. CF is not a sport and therefore does not qualify as ‘competition’ for this poll.</p>

  <p>_Update version 1.4</p>
<p>Updated weightlifting shoe links </p></p>
<p>[spoiler show=”Show past updates” hide=”Hide past updates”]Update version 1.31</p>
<p>Added singlet, shoe (Canadian) and belt (UK) links</p>
<p>Added section on knee sleeves</p>
<p>Added section on chalk[/spoiler]</em></p>
<p>I get questions periodically on singlets, belts, shoes, etc. This post will link to some older articles, touch on some important points, and open the forum for the input of the readers. Let’s make this a comprehensive gear post where someone can learn about, compare, and find links to various products. It is important to note that 70’s Big is open to advertising for companies that sell lifting gear. Also, you’ll notice that we aren’t talking about squat suits or bench shirts because they are fucking irrelevant (more on this another time).</p>
<p><strong>Shoes</strong></p>
<p>Read about why lifting shoes are important <a href="/blog/2010/01/equip-for-the-quest-%E2%80%93-shoes-part-2/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/04/rogue-2010-do-win-weightlifting-shoe-2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3900" data-permalink="/blog/2011/04/gear/rogue-2010-do-win-weightlifting-shoe-2/" data-orig-file="/2011/04/rogue-2010-do-win-weightlifting-shoe-2.jpg" data-orig-size="300,205" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="rogue-2010-do-win-weightlifting-shoe-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/04/rogue-2010-do-win-weightlifting-shoe-2.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/04/rogue-2010-do-win-weightlifting-shoe-2.jpg" src="/2011/04/rogue-2010-do-win-weightlifting-shoe-2.jpg" alt="" title="rogue-2010-do-win-weightlifting-shoe-2" width="300" height="205" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3900" /></a></p>
<p><em>Summary:</em></p>
<p>Shoes will improve efficiency and safety when lifting.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The sole is wider, thus more stable (an important reason why lifting in Chucks is inadequate).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sole is made of material that increases the coefficient of friction when articulating with the ground so that you don’t slip. This is obviously imperative when Olympic lifting but still useful for squatting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The upper is typically made of leather as opposed to canvas, thus it is more stable when compounded with…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The metatarsal strap(s) help hold the feet in place to prevent foot-in-the-shoe movement. This is, again, imperative with Oly lifting, but incredibly useful for squatting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most importantly, the additional heel height (of about .75″) improves mechanics for squatting and pulling. The angle change in the ankle reverberates to the knee and subsequently hip to have a better balance of musculature around the knee and hip. When someone squats in lifting shoes for the first time, it always — ALWAYS — looks better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sole and heel are made of non-compressible material which prevents any spongy bounce from redirecting the force you are trying to apply into the ground. Yes, Chucks compress. Running shoes are ignorant; each rep is a new experience because of the cushioned sole. Not to mention those shoes don’t have the other qualities already listed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Shoe Brands</em></p>
<p>Some times shoes are just called “lifting shoes” and other times they are specifically called “Olympic weightlifting shoes”. In either case, you’ll want the slight heel like the picture above. Avoid any that have a heel larger than one inch. Brands include <a href="http://www.ristosports.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=1">Risto</a>, <a href="http://www.roguefitness.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=weightlifting+shoes">Rogue</a>, <a href="http://www.pendlaybarbell.com/">Pendlay</a> (not direct link), <a href="http://www.roguefitness.com/nike-romaleos-weightlifting-shoes.php">Nike</a> (<a href="http://reviews.nike.com/9191/315815/nike-romaleos-mens-weightlifting-shoe-reviews/reviews.htm" target="_blank">another</a>), <a href="http://www.shopadidas.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3025358">Adidas</a> (or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=adidas+weightlifting+shoes" target="_blank">try here</a>), and <a href="http://www.vsathletics.com/product.php?xProd=1301">VS Athletics</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://buyweightliftingshoes.com/">Here’s a site</a> that has various brands.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://weightliftingshoes.ca/">Canadian</a> buyers.</p>
<p>Some of the shoe brands only list one of their shoes. If you want to post a link to other brands, or a greater selection in each brand, do so in the comments and I’ll edit the section.</p>
<p><strong>Belts</strong></p>
<p>I’ve written about belts a lot, but I still get workshop attendees who don’t understand why they are necessary (same with shoes). Here are four links to information on belts with varying levels of detail.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2009/12/belt-me-up-scotty/">One</a> — Generally speaking</p>

<p><a href="/2011/04/belts-400x300.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3901" data-permalink="/blog/2011/04/gear/belts-400x300/" data-orig-file="/2011/04/belts-400x300.jpg" data-orig-size="400,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="belts-400&#215;300" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/04/belts-400x300.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/04/belts-400x300.jpg" src="/2011/04/belts-400x300.jpg" alt="" title="belts-400x300" width="400" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3901" /></a></p>
<p><em>Summary:</em></p>
<p>A belt most certainly does not “turn the abs off”, but instead makes them stronger to help aid in the Vasalva Maneuver, or increase in intra-abdominal and thoracic pressure that protects the spine in lifting. A belt functions on the abdominals, not the back. Thus, belts that are narrow in the front and flared in the back are irrelevant. The slight constriction of trunk volume by a belt with the same breath of air (a big breath) will result in increased pressure compared to no belt (volume down, contents same = pressure up — Boyle’s Law). The abs contract harder isometrically into the belt and get stronger quicker. Not only are the muscles getting stronger, but the additional pressure increases efficiency and safety. By choosing to not be safe and efficient, you are not only limiting your strength improvement, but doing so with crappier form and a higher potential for injury. Probably something you should think about.</p>
<p><em>Brands and Types</em></p>
<p>Good belt websites have changed a bit since this site has been active and I haven’t had to buy one lately, so I’m unfamiliar with the market. Please post belt sites to the comments with some quick comments. It’s important to note that suede belts are used in strength training (including powerlifting competitions) while the velcro belts are typically only used in Olympic weightlifting. Also, in some powerlifting federations you can’t wear velcro belts.</p>

<p><strong>Pulling Straps</strong></p>
<p>Unless you’re pulling well over twice your body weight or have been lifting at least for several years, you won’t need to worry about straps. If you are, then I always look to Iron Mind for straps. The world’s strongest men use them. I mean that literally, they use them in the World’s Strongest Man Competition. There are various kinds of various lengths fit for Oly lifting (the shorter, sewn kind) or heavy fat bar pulling.</p>
<p><a href="http://ironmind-store.com/Lifting-Straps/products/36/">Iron Mind Straps</a> — Note that there are two pages</p>
<p>If you have used other straps, feel free to post the brand links to the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Singlets</strong></p>
<p>Singlets are necessary for competition. Styles and colors can vary; Olympic weightlifting are typically spandex material with longer legs and powerlifting singlets typically have shorter legs. I will point out that singlets are made of stretchy material and it’s better to have a singlet that’s a bit too small than too big. I’d suggest getting a size smaller than what the company fits you for — I bought one that was a bit too big and the straps irritatingly slid around (of course it was too small for my thighs).</p>

<p><strong>Knee Sleeves</strong></p>
<p>Knee sleeves aren’t required, but some find utility in them. They provide some stability and proprioception feedback that will help the lifter feel more comfortable. More importantly, they will trap heat that the leg is giving off to keep the knee warm. This will provide external warmth (as opposed to internal via blood flow) to the superficial ligaments and tendons of the knee, particularly the patellar ligament and tendon. When these structures are warmed, they are more pliable and less likely to experience pain or be hurt. Powerlifters and weightlifters both use knee sleeves.</p>

    Rehabands on a hairless, 90's Small model
  </p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.rehband.com/products/knee.html"><strong>Rehband</strong></a> knee sleeves are top of the line. They are expensive (around $60 for a pair) and made of neoprene, but they will be the best warmth and support for knees. They won’t provide an ergonomic aid to the movement like knee wraps would, yet they will feel like they “help”.</p>
<p>The expensive Rehbands aren’t mandatory if you are having general knee soreness (which is usually caused by too much too soon, and can be alleviated over time unless there is an existing injury). I used cheap sleeves from a local sport store. They were black and a similar material to an ace bandage and were five dollars each. It provided the warmth I desired at a low cost. I wore them to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZFKv6dfmiI">nationals</a>. It’s noteworthy that this section isn’t referring to knee sleeves with a whole over the patella (I’d prefer to not have a whole to keep the warmth in).</p>
<p><strong>Chalk</strong></p>
<p>Chalk is necessary for lifting, especially when sweating. It increases the coefficient of friction when your hand touches a bar. Your friends can even draw phallic symbols on your back with it. It is available in lots of places online, whether you are searching lifting or mountain climbing chalk. Most lifters will agree that having the actual block (or pieces of it) to rub on your hands is preferable to a bowl of dust.</p>

<p>If there are any other pieces of gear you think should be on this page (like supportive wrist straps), then give your thoughts in the comments. Feel free to comment on brands that you actually own so that potential shoppers can get objective feedback. Don’t give your thoughts on something you haven’t actually used consistently over time.</p>

  <p><em>Here is the weekly installment of 70’s Big Females by Cori and Ellee.</em></p>
<p>First, we must address the issue of how to properly measure the 70’s Big Booty. Please watch our instructional video today:</p>
<p><strong>Measuring the Ass</strong></p>
<p>*For total accuracy, it should actually take place in the nude, but for the sake of keeping it clean, we are clothed. Here at 70’s Big Female, we take ass size VERY seriously!</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="283" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RcQh2V9J6KI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>*For the record, Cori qualified at an outstanding 41 inches! ASSessment results: PASS. 70’s Big Female membership was made official with a congratulatory and obligatory ass slap (vital component).</p>
<p><strong>Grunt. Groan. Yell. Scream.</strong></p>
<p>Is it okay for women to make grunting noises while lifting? We are going reply with an emphatic YES and here is why. Have you ever pinned yourself under a clean and couldn’t get up? Grabbed on to a deadlift and tried like hell to pull yet to no avail? Have you had to aggressively finish your pull on a snatch in order to get under the weight? Did you clench your gut and let out a whelp? If you didn’t, maybe you should have. If you did, we bet it felt really fucking good. It’s not just about making beastly noises and showing that you are the alpha female. Part of the grunting is you performing the Valsalva maneuver.</p>
<p>You are basically restraining your airway during an attempted forced expiration against a closed glottis. This keeps air from escaping your lungs, and the muscles of your abdomen and rib cage contract. This creates rigid compartments of fluid in the lower torso and air in the upper torso. The advantage is increasing the rigidity of the entire torso, making it easier to support heavy weights!</p>
<p>Once you hit that sticky point, go ahead and release a tiny bit of that pressure with a hearty groan. Part of grunting, screaming, whaling, etc can be vital to making some of your heaviest lifts! In addition, you can spare yourself from those occasional, unsightly petechiae (broken capillary blood vessels) around your eyes. Better yet, you may avoid keeling over like a woman of the 16th Century whose corset is too tight. We may be ladies, but we are not delicate flowers!</p>
<p>(<em>Editor’s Note: The groan, grunt, scream, or forceful exhaling with the tongue on the teeth</em> will <em>temporarily spike intra-abdominal and thoracic pressure but will relieve a bit of the blood vessel pressure, hence the reason you should do it if you’re about to white out or pass out in the hardest part of a lift [locking out DLs, sticking point of front squat, etc.]</em>)</p>
<p>Okay so maybe you are feeling a bit self-conscious and aren’t comfortable showing off your alpha female yet. Fine, but we dare you to give it a go. When you start making crazy faces and wailing like a banshee the weight on the bar is no longer an issue. Not to mention how incredible it feels to just unleash the inner she-beast and scream during most acts of physical exertion and exhilaration. Fuck the neighbors!!! But we digress . . .</p>
<p><strong>70’s Big Female Tasks of the Week:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let it out! Show us what you got! And then tell us how it went and how amazing your lifting was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your ass has been legitimately measured. Remember, at least 38”!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love your body as much as possible and to celebrate, walk around your domicile in the nude!</p>
</li>
</ol>

  <p>Training consistently is a learning process, an active process of introspection. Getting stronger isn’t easy. It requires a laboring, painful work that will only be expressed in the next bout of laboring, painful work. Yet with strength training, that process is just as important as the end. Choosing to do something hard — of your own volition — puts the mind in a vulnerable state. It forces you to decide whether or not you think you’re capable. Want to complete a set, but don’t think you can? You won’t. Staring down the bar, daring it to beat you and <em>knowing</em> that you will crush it; that is something entirely different, my friends.</p>
<p>It isn’t about merely attempting something that is Very. Fucking. Hard. But shifting the mindset into not just the possibility of completion, but the explosive dominance and subsequent victory you’ll have over that barrier. The mindset itself is the victory. The destruction of the set is the victory lap. The weening moments after when your heart is still racing and short of breath — that’s standing on the podium. Learning how to give everything you have mentally and physically to achieve your goals is what getting stronger is all about.</p>
<p>Happy PR Friday.</p>

  <p><em>The following meet recap is by Yosh, a 70’s Big reader and mustache enthusiast. The recap gives you an idea of what to expect at a meet, a unique view of a bench/pull meet, and some info on impressive local lifters.</em></p>
<p><strong>2011 WABDL Montana State Bench Press and Deadlift Championship</strong></p>
<p>My fiancé, Alicia, and I both deadlifted at the 2011 WABDL Montana State Bench Press and Deadlift Championship this past weekend. The meet was organized by Gus Rethwisch. WABDL is an equipped federation but we both lifted raw. Most of the lifters had equipment, but it also seemed like quite a few people lifted raw. This was Alicia’s first time deadlifting at a meet and she did extremely well. She lifted 4/4 and got a PR and setting the state record of 192.7lbs in the 105lbs class.</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="283" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TXzHk9VoKN8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I got a deadlift meet PR on my first attempt at 512.5lbs and couldn’t seal the deal on the lockout for my second attempt at 545.5lbs. After nearly passing out from my second attempt, I was out of gas on my third attempt and barely got the weight off of the platform before I red lighted. I’m typically more conservative in my attempts, but in my final workout leading up to the meet I pulled 540lbs and then 545lbs so I felt confident that I would pull 545.5lbs without a problem.</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="283" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/V0sYzByLBzQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I signed up for the 181 weight class and the Monday before the meet I looked at the scale and it read 194lbs so I had to cut some weight. I have cut weight for most of my powerlifting competitions, so it wasn’t anything new. Alicia also had to cut about five pounds to make weight. I cut back on my complex carbs and food portions and drink a lot of water from Monday until Thursday afternoon. Then I went without food or water for about 24hrs until the weigh-ins on Friday afternoon. As I’ve never had a meet closer than a three hour drive, I have developed a water weight cutting technique where I blast the heat in my truck to sweat out the last few pounds while I travel. I made weight at 181.2lbs and then headed to Famous Dave’s for a BBQ feast. WABDL has weigh-ins 24 hours before lifting, so Alicia and I both rehydrated and refueled.</p>
<p>The meet was at Ruby’s Inn and Convention Center in Missoula, MT. The inn offered discounted rates and I always like when the meet is at the hotel I’m staying at. Not having to worry about finding a random school or gym in a new town is one less thing to stress about. The inn also had a full breakfast buffet which is another plus. The warm up room was small and felt crowded so that could have been improved. The rules meeting started at 8:15am Saturday morning. It was sort of funny at the rules meeting because everyone was walking into the room and there was a lady sitting at a table by the door to get admission from spectators. She totally called out Alicia saying that this meeting was for lifters only. Alicia had to tell her that she was a lifter too. Being 5’2″ and in the 105lbs weight class, she did seem to be an odd one out in the room. The meeting had the typical directions on what commands there would be and Gus Rethwisch also spent a little bit of time on a tangent talking about steroid use. He stated that there are no drug free federations but just drug tested ones and that WABDL does do drug testing and wants a level playing field. He also said that if anybody is thinking about starting to take steroids that it isn’t worth it. Gus said that he used them in the past when they were legal but didn’t feel like he had any gains from it. He stated his PRs from the 1970s that he accomplished clean with minimal equipment. Even though WABDL is equipped, I think Gus deep down likes raw lifting better.</p>
<p>The lifting started a little bit after 9:00am. There were three flights of bench pressers and two flights of deadlifters with about a total of 60-70 lifters. People came from the Spokane area of Washington, Idaho, and Montana to lift. There are many great lifters from this area. Some of the highlights were the bench pressers that train at Baldwin’s fitness center and the Goosetown Athletic Club to include Terry Baldwin, Don Linerud, Charlie Farmer, Dustin Hanson, and Chris Hinkey. Dustin Hanson has the world record WABDL bench press record in the 148 lbs weight class in single ply at about 445 lbs. Don Linerud has about a 606 lbs bench press in the single ply 181 lbs weight class. These guys drive up to 2-3 hours from Spokane or all over western Montana to train together. I don’t know anything about equipped lifting, but those guys are always impressive.</p>

    Young Trent Rodgers pulling 600 raw
  </p>
</div>
<p>Other highlights include the lifters from Idaho that I see nearly every meet. Curt Tewalt is one of the nicest guys you’ll ever meet, but on the platform his intensity is through the roof. He lifts raw and weighs in around 250-260lbs. If I can remember correctly, I think he benched 407 lbs and pulled 767 lbs at the meet (see video below). Trent Rodgers is an up and coming lifter who is only 19 or 20. He weighed in around 260 lbs and benched 374 lbs and pulled a little over 600 lbs raw as well.</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="450" height="283" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qi-2ctUJXQg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Seeing some of the guys in the master’s division were also very impressive. There was a 77 year old man who benched 303 lbs raw. It kind of funny seeing him need help to get off of the bench after being able to push over 300 lbs in a t-shirt. Gus, during the award ceremony, also said that he was a decorated Korean War veteran.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a smooth meet. The spotters/loaders were very quick and efficient. All flights were finished lifting with a couple breaks by 1:00pm. The results were quickly tabulated and pretty much rolled right into the award ceremony. This was the fifth meet I’ve competed in and the award ceremony never happened that quickly. I’ve typically seen the meet officials looking over a computer or score cards for 20-30 minutes before the awards were ready so kudos to WABDL.</p>

  <p><em>The following is a post written by Paul, a retired USMC Colonel who had success running the <a href="/public_html/files/Articles/Lascek_S&amp;CP_v2.0.pdf">S&amp;C Program</a> that I created a couple years ago. He’s under the guidance of Eric Montgomery, a really sharp guy who is doing an excellent job of programming and coaching. Eric’s comments are after Paul’s in italics.</em></p>
<p>It is hard to add a lot of new information to what has already been written about Justin Lascek’s program. Yet here I am adding another such story to the mix. Hopefully my experience will be helpful and motivating to someone. In just 8 weeks of following the Justin Lascek approach seasoned with a lot of Mark Rippetoe, STARTING STRENGTH, guidance I had measureable strength increase that exceeded what I had been able to gain in the previous 8 months doing CrossFit.</p>
<p>My basic profile is: a 52 year old male, about 6 feet tall and tip the scale today at 195. I have limited barbell experience before I started CrossFit about a year ago. I retired from the Marine Corps in 2006. After I retired I struggled to maintain any sort of fitness. Combine that with stupid things like a lot of business travel including the seemingly requisite late night meals, decadent carbs and lack of sleep, I was becoming a physical wreck, fat and old.</p>
<p>I was able finally to drop the endless business travel and began searching for a program to fix my sorry ass. Some colleagues pointed me at CF.com. I followed CF.com by myself at various military fitness centers for about a year mainly because it was fun and because it was completely different from the useless Marine Corps way—jog three miles slowly, do some pull-ups and crunches then go back to an office and brag about what a bad ass you were—that I had followed for decades. Being the novice that I was, I noticed some good results. I felt better, slept better and was slightly stronger. Unfortunately, I didn’t do all of CrossFit. I ignored any of the nutrition stuff and continued to eat the typical, high carb, get ready for Diabetes and cancer diet– I didn’t know any better and didn’t research.</p>
<p>Even though I felt better and was getting some good results, I knew that doing CF alone was probably not optimal and that any progress would be slow. Fortuitously, I ran across Trish Davis, then of CFSD, during a computer security course and she recommended CFSD. Following Trish’s recommendation, in Sept 2009, I started a Crossfit Foundations course with Nathan Stivers—then a CFSD trainer.</p>
<p>However, I had another health issues to deal with before I could continue. In the last part of the same month, radiologists confirmed that I had a type 1 lung cancer. I was fortunate in that it was found very early, before any metastasize—if I said that right—it appeared to not have spread anywhere. Nevertheless, the treatment was a lobectomy—surgery to chop out my left lower lung lobe.</p>
<p>Surgery was scheduled for October 21 of 2009. However, I continued at CFSD all the way up to the day before surgery. On October 20th, I remember doing one rep max weighted pull-ups at over 80lbs. Then the next day open chest surgery. BTW, if you can avoid surgery of any type, I highly recommend it. I got some great pain meds and overall great Navy medical care. But it still hurt like hell.</p>
<p>The worst part was that I couldn’t train for ten weeks. I wanted to train so bad that two days after surgery, flying high on morphine, I was trying to do air squats in the hospital bathroom. My son ratted me out to the surgeon and I was told in no uncertain terms to lay off for the full ten weeks of recovery.</p>
<p>Slowly the ten weeks passed, the holidays of 2009 passed and I was finally able to get at it again at CF San Diego in January of 2010. Suffice to say I was pretty much a physical wreck—again. I was doing banded pull-ups, knee pushups and overall generally just a mess. However, once I started training again things improved rapidly. I lost the bands in a few weeks and got off my knees for pushups about the same time.</p>
<p>This is where the real story begins that is relevant for 70s Big. I did a Crossfit total (combined weight for one rep max Squat, Press and Deadlift) in May of 2010 and scored what I thought was well considering I’d been on an operating table just a few months earlier. My CFT at that time was 750. The coach at the time made an off the cuff comment that I was on my way to 1000. Hmmm, 750 to 1000 any time soon, I doubted her veracity.</p>
<p>For the next several months, I followed the basic CFSD programming including following the Zone/paleo diet suggestions. I consistently attended classes and competed with my peers at the box. Yet I felt that I struggled at too many CrossFit expected movements—handstand pushups, 20 lbs wall ball, DUs, OHS etc. Then the real gut check came when my 26 year old daughter, already a Rippetoe convert, told me essentially “Dad you suck because you’re weak. You need to get strong, now! You aren’t getting any younger. Get Rippetoe’s book and get on with it.” Well she was right, I did suck and I was weak. However, the positive side was I could get Rip’s book and try to do something to get stronger.</p>
<p>In January 2011, I was still getting my plan together about how to incorporate a strength program while I was still playing with my friends in the CFSD morning class. Then another CFT came upon the schedule. I still showed reasonable gains. I squatted 334, deadlifted 423 and a weak press of 135. That was the second gut check; I realized that I’d never get really good numbers doing the eclectic programming that is prominent at CF boxes. BTW, CFSD is a great place and the programmers really do a good job trying to increase member’s general fitness while pleasing all the various motivations and goals of a big group of Crossfitters.</p>
<p>Those two gut checks did it. I quit attending classes and carved out a time on a barbell platform three days a week. I took Rip’s SS as gospel and started following it completely—for a week. The feedback I got when I talked with others about it was: “WARNING your metcons will suffer.” BTW, I’m the guy with half a lung—my metcons already sucked. Yet, I spoke about this with trainer Eric Montgomery. He suggested the Justin Lascek modification to Rip’s guidance—little slower gains, a couple more exercises and two metcons a week. Okay, if Eric tells me something, I do it. I dropped the three days a week SS program and started the Lascek 70s Big program with two short metcons for conditioning. I have followed it exactly for about 8 weeks now. I also followed closely the Rippetoe prescriptions for protein consumption, except milk, and a paleo diet with some unflavored protein powder supplement.</p>
<p>I did the CFT today for fun, March 31, 2011. CFT today was 1034, a 144 lbs increase from the end of January, in just 8 weeks. Squat went from 334 to 405. Deadlift went from 423 to 475. Both lifts were easy. Press increased by 19 lbs, to 154lbs. That is still weak, but a vast improvement from January. Moreover, I’ve increased muscle mass and decreased body fat. My tape measurements show my body fat is around 12%. I’d never had a body fat lower than 18% even when I weighed 15 lbs less.</p>
<p>So in 8 weeks following the 70s Big S&amp;C program, I increased my CFT by 144lbs and landed in the Advanced Athlete block of the CFT chart on CF.com FAQ. That is a four lbs greater increase than I got during 8 months of CFSD basic programming.</p>
<p><strong>Eric’s notes:</strong></p>
<p>_It’s also worth mentioning that his form is about 100% better than it used to be. As of a few months his squats in particular didn’t look that great, mainly due to some mobility issues. To the best of my knowledge he hasn’t done any intensive mobility work aside from some basic K-Star stuff—simply squatting more has fixed most of his flexibility issues and made him much better at squatting.</p>
<p>The other thing that Paul didn’t emphasize as much as he should have is that he did the program to an absolute T, and was 100% consistent and compliant. No fancy modifications, no skipped days, nothing. That’s not to say he blindly followed the program—he came to me with questions on a fairly regular basis, but as soon as I gave him the logic behind why the program is designed the way it is, he accepted my reasoning, put his head down, and went to work on the platform.</p>
<p>His progress also proves that a lifter can go from the relative novice stage to solid numbers without completely losing all his conditioning or putting on a lot of soft weight. For instance, he just posted a 4:28 Fran yesterday, which compares quite nicely to his previous PR of 7:10 set about 4 months ago. Paul looks pretty ripped right now without even really trying to, and I’d probably yell at him to gain 20lbs if his numbers gave me any indication that lack of weight gain was stalling his progress. Maybe if things slow down a bit and he decides he wants to make a push for 500lbs on his squat and 600lbs on his deadlift we’ll revisit the bodyweight issue, but as of now it’s not holding him back at all.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the first two Games workouts have skewed heavily towards lightweight metcon machines, and despite the fact that he’s competing with 1.5 lungs, Paul is currently 58th out of 249 in the 50-54 age group. Expect him to start smoking non-adult males as soon as the first halfway heavy workout comes up.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of him squatting 156kg for a set of 5 last week. Before anyone jumps on him for it, when Paul emailed me the link he immediately noted that he needs to get about 2″ deeper on all of those reps. I did get verification that his 405lb 1RM was to legit depth though.</p></p>

  <p><em>The following post was written by Cori and Ellee from <a href="http://safefitness.net/">Safe Fitness</a> in Chicago. They are sick of the lack of leadership in the female 70’s Big community, specifically the need for better and bigger asses.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-70s-big-female">What does it mean to be a 70’s Big Female?</h2>
<p>Easy answer, ass size must be greater than 38” around. Why does this matter? Having a big ass means you can move and squat heavy weight, preferably at least your body weight. You might ask, well what about having a fat ass, does that count? No. Being a 70’s Big Female is not just about having a dumptruck on your backside, but you must also be able to haul that dumptruck wherever life may need it to go. Example: chin ups, pull ups, overhead squats, etc. It is more about having a GREAT ass.</p>
<p>In Cori’s 24 years of life on this planet – nearly all of them spent in a gym (playpen positioned right next to the chalk bowl, barbell in hand) – she has seen many women who would qualify as a 70’s Big Female, but has also seen many who would not represent. These women prefer to be skinny rather than strong. SKINNY = FAIL! What they don’t understand is that training hard, squatting heavy, and lifting serious weights is sexy.</p>

    Lifting quite clearly makes you sexy (Cori as a youngster)
  </p>
</div>
<p>In addition, we have got to get other 70’s Big Females training to be to able haul their great asses off the ground from a dead hang position. This is not something that comes easily to most women, especially when you are carting around a 38” undercarriage, but with hard work, it is totally attainable. Pretty soon you’ll be cranking them out like Sarah Connor in Terminator 2, doing chin-ups in the mental hospital right before she beats the shit out of those guards. Sweaty, strong, and fucking badass.</p>
<p>Cori’s father runs a high school Olympic weightlifting program in Minnesota and recently told us he was having problems recruiting young female lifters. He asked one of the volleyball coaches why these girls did not want to train and get better at their sport. The volleyball coach stated that the leaders on the team wanted to “look smaller” rather than be a powerhouse volleyball team. Skinny instead of winning? Come on girls, it’s all about WINNING (sorry, Charlie)! We think the skinny mentality is toxic and could spread to the rest of the team. Where are our 70’s Big Female leaders? Who can tell these young girls that sexiness and winning comes from squatting BIG, not being a twig fairy. It happens by actually putting weight on the barbell and going up and down, up and down, up and down, etc. You get the point. We would like to empower women by encouraging them to strive to be “real women”. Strong women. Thirty-eight inch ass women. 70’s Big Women.</p>

    Ellee in Sarah Conner garb, pre-rip
  </p>
</div>
<p>Last Halloween, Ellee was doing a WOD (while wearing her Sarah Connor costume) where heavy overhead squats were the main attraction. Minutes into the overhead squats, she felt some intense restriction in the ass/thigh region of her pants while performing the squats, but she decided to power-through. However, her ass could not be contained, and her left butt cheek flew out of the cheap-ass material. We are talking a clean rip of about 14” centered over the left ass. Fellas, she only wears g-strings, so she had nothing to hide behind. Ellee was a bit embarrassed, but Cori guarantees that every female in the gym was thinking, “Damn! If my ass rips out of my pants – I sure hope it looks as good as hers!” Now that is a true LEADER!</p>

<p>So 70’s Big Females, here is your challenge this week:</p>
<p>1 – Measure that ass and be proud!</p>
<p>2 – Make sure you can squat at least your bodyweight in one of your training sessions this week. Better yet, try to clean and jerk your body weight.</p>
<p>3 – Try to haul that ass up by working on your dead hang chin ups. Try to get one per day at first. Nothing sexier than that scene in Terminator 2.</p>
<p>4 – We dare you to try and blow out your pants!</p>
<p>Leave comments on your success! Until next time…</p>

  <p>Folks, we talk a lot about barbell training on this site, but we ignore too many other forms of training out there. For instance, look at the utility in this equipment:</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/h5w1gyBpV2M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>First, they save you $125. What you are saving it on is immaterial. Instead, look at the set-up. Yes, the actor may be a bit smaller than us, but look at his attire. He looks great! And he’s so functional — the shaking he experiences on the ring push-ups means he’s building functionality that can’t be attained anywhere else.</p>
<p>As far as programs go, P90X is magnificent. If you go to 1:48 in this video and watch the progress pictures, you’ll notice how P90X magnificently removed body hair from this subject. Magnificent ;-)</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BLxLuirbZc4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Lastly, a lot of you have been thinking about trying out Olympic lifting. I advise you, good sirs, to obtain optimal form with PVC pipe before attempting it with a bar. If you can’t do it with PVC, how can you do it with a load?</p>

<p>I am so excited to announce that it is PR Friday! I caution you “heavy eaters” out there to not post today, let’s focus on healthy eating in this PR Friday. The only people that can post are lifters who eat less than 50 grams of carbohydrates a day and squat more than 500 pounds. Also, if you don’t do everything I say, you can’t post here either. Oh, and you have to call me High Chancellor when you do it. Or else.</p>

  <p>Most of you think that Part 1 doesn’t apply to you since I was targeting beginners, yet I’ve gotten questions on sets and rep schemes for curls and RDLs. Most programs are more complicated than they need to be. By only making a program more complicated when it has to be in order to advance strength, you’ll avoid worrying too much about it.</p>
<p>Yet almost all of you worry too much about your technique, particularly the low bar squat. The low bar squat isn’t as simple as going down and then coming back up; it’s harder than a power snatch or clean. But once you do some reading and research it, and the other barbell lifts, aren’t terribly hard. Don’t over complicate back angles, knee movements, and elbow positions. Most of you do, and it makes my job as the teacher via website more complicated. If I want to discuss what the knees are doing at the bottom of a squat, then all the Starting Strength fans get all worried and start analyzing their lifting footage. When I teach, I will give all of the technical details that I can, but I’ll take a step back and simplify it.</p>
<p>With coaching, we use “cues” to get the lifter to make a correction. Cues should apply a conceptual lesson and be a reminder for the practical lesson. All of you who have taught yourself how to squat lose out on the practical lesson and may miss out on at least half of the conceptual. But don’t worry! It’ll be okay, I promise. There are some very basic cues for each lift that will eliminate at least 75% of your problems.</p>

    Chris shows great form
  </p>
</div>
<p>Regardless of the type of squat, shove your knees out and think “mid-foot”. Shoving the knees out facilitates depth because the femur is no longer getting pushed into the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (ASIS), or the hip pointer. Rippetoe detailed this in full in his “Active Hip” article. The femur can now move in a range of motion outside of the ASIS and get better depth. More importantly, the external rotators of the hip are contracted since the hip is in external rotation, and the adductors and, to a lesser extent, the hamstrings are stretched and under tension. Contraction in the external rotators and tension in the adductors means there is more tightness and muscle action around the hip, which makes for a stable, stronger squat. Yes, there are some frivolities between high bar and low bar (and even the wide stance high bar positioned lean-over-with-vertical-shins-as-if-we’re-wearing-a-squat-suit-even-though-we’re-lifting-raw squat, which is ridiculous), yet if all squatters focus on shoving the knees out, they are going to get stronger better than had they not. The “mid-foot” is directly in front of the heel of the foot (if you place your finger at the front (or arch side) of where your heel begins, that’s it). By imagining the load balanced on that point, the bar can track up and down over that point easier regardless of where the bar is positioned. This will help prevent backward and more specifically forward movement (that brings the lifter on their toes and jerks the knees forward at the bottom).</p>
<p>When deadlifting, it’s best to start with the bar over the foot and drag the bar up the shins and thighs. Getting the scapula over the bar is ideal, but that adds a third thing to think about. Instead, just set up with the bar over the mid-foot (often where the laces are tied), touch the shins to the bar, and drag it up the legs. Of course you should be squeezing your chest up and trying to have an extended back — this should be obvious — but worrying about the angle of the back and muscle activation is just going to complicate things. If the bar is dragged up the legs and doesn’t flop forward, then it’s going to be pretty damn efficient. If you can consistently do these two things (start with bar over mid-foot, drag it up legs), then you can start worrying about the frivolities. However, you’ll find there aren’t many of them.</p>
<p>Pressing merely requires a that your elbows are underneath or slightly in front of the bar at the start, and a vertical bar path. If you’re doing touch and go, you’ll have to think about bringing the bar straight down from the top — “keep it close” is a good cue that implies the bar should be close to the face.</p>
<p>These are all very simple cues. Before you even begin to think about worrying about what’s going on with your squat, make sure that you are addressing these cues. If your knees are shooting forward at the bottom of the squat, and you aren’t shoving the shit out of your knees and thinking mid-foot, then once you cue those two things, it’ll probably clear itself up. If you can’t keep the deadlift on your shins at the start of the pull, then you need to cue the “bar over mid-foot” and “drag against legs” cues. The fact that the bar is flopping away from you means that either your butt is too low or the shoulders aren’t extending, but you worrying about that is irrelevant if you’re not following the first two simple cues.</p>
<p>Most of you over complicate things because you try and learn how a system works by memorizing the “cause and effect” of the parts. You see the knees going forward and here an authority say, “The back angle is too vertical” so you associate all forward knee issues with a vertical torso. Or you see a thread on someone who was leaning over way too much in their squat and worry that you are too. Keep in mind that you <em>aren’t the coach</em>. You have to learn how the system, in this case the body as a whole, functions within each movement instead of how the body parts function in a specific scenario. In the squat and deadlift the trunk, thigh, and shin segments are all related. In the squat, a vertical torso will not have as much flexion at the bottom compared to a torso with more angle. This effects the musculature of the hip, but also the positioning and musculature around the knee. But that’s all fucking irrelevant because <strong>you’re not the coach</strong>.</p>
<p>Trying to make an analysis, especially on a video on the internet of someone you don’t know, is probably only going to confuse you and that person. And I’m not even getting to the situations when there are 5 things wrong in someone’s squat and the interwebz tells them how to fix 9 things. A lifter should only think about a maximum of two cues when they lift; anything else fucks things up. If the above cues are followed, then most problems will be non-existent or not a big deal.</p>
<p>Stop worrying so much about what your technique looks like and how it compares to other people. Just make sure it has a baseline of efficiency. You’ll be okay. I promise.</p>
