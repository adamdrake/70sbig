  <p><em>Unfortunately you thought this was another awesome post on brisket. Instead, it’s a meet recap from a guy named Briskin, but we just call him Brisket because it’s smart. Here is his meet recap:</em></p>
<p>Short version: I hit PRs in all my lifts, experimented with some new substances, and had a terrific time. Everyone involved was extremely supportive and a credit to the sport, except for one idiot who I will talk about later.</p>
<p>To prepare for my first meet, without going into excruciating detail, I used a version of the Texas Method I’ve been doing some form of TM programming for more than a year (started in January 2010) with good results, especially in the squat. Then, about three weeks out from the meet, I succumbed to the flu, which didn’t derail me completely, but it did cause me to miss a couple of important sessions. I bounced back quickly by pounding down water and protein, and was feeling okay one week out.</p>
<p>I showed up the afternoon before the meet. Ted Isabella, the USPF official in charge, was patient in helping me submit my openers and figure out my rack heights. In training, I weighed about 190, and I decided that instead of worrying about cutting a significant amount of weight for my very first meet, I would just show up at 190 and be in the middle of the 90kg class, no big deal. Then I got a shock when I stripped down to my underwear and stepped on the scale; 82.9kg (182.7lbs). My first thought was “There’s no way that’s right,” closely followed by “I hope Justin doesn’t find out about this.” Even though the flu had caused me to lose some weight, my appetite had mostly come back, my clothes hadn’t felt any looser, and I thought there was just no way in hell I was still down over seven pounds. Still, the scale said I was .4kg over the 82.5kg class. I decided if I was going to be that guy who weighs under 200lbs, I might as well do it properly, so I went to the john and caught up on some reading. Later I realized the meet scale must have been light, because the other lifters said they had the same experience. I was relieved to know that I wasn’t really that depleted, because it would have completely shot my confidence, but for better or worse, I was in the 82.5kg class.</p>
<p>This meet turned out to be small, only 22 lifters. Each lift went in two flights, with the first flight of each lift mostly composed of a team of kids from a local high school (more on them later). I served as my own handler and coach, which worked out fine. I started warming up each lift, taking plenty of time between sets, when I heard the start of the “A” flight announced. Between my lifts in the warmup room I stepped back in to the main room to watch some of the high school kids lifting. Then, when the end of the A flight was announced, I knew that it was time to hit my last warmup and move to the staging area. Of course, not having a handler to keep me updated on events and give my attempts to the officials meant more standing and walking around for me, but since I had nervous energy pouring out of my ears at this point, that suited me perfectly.</p>
<p>Before this meet I hadn’t really understood the wonder of adrenaline, or how well the competitive environment can channel it. As the last of the “A” squats was announced, I hit my final squat warmup at 385. “Damn,” I thought, “that felt pretty heavy.” Five minutes later, I was walking out for my opener at 195kg (430). I don’t usually scream or get very emotional in the gym, except for some quiet, inner psyching up for PR sets, but today I was foaming at the mouth on nearly every attempt. I unracked 430, waited for the “squat” command like a good boy and bounced the ever-living hell out of it. I was getting the “rack” command faster than I could blink. I was so excited at how light the opener felt that I stormed off the platform all the way to the back of the staging area, and right past the woman asking me what I wanted for my second attempt. I went back and called for 205kg (452), then resumed pacing.</p>
<p>My second attempt started much like the first, no problems waiting for the squat command. Again, I blasted it up fast, so fast that my left foot did a stupid little jig before the “rack” command, which got me three reds. This put me in a bit of a jam; I knew I had more in the tank, but if I missed my third attempt I would get credit only for my opening 430. I went back to the staging area and considered calling for 210kg, which I knew I could make. Then I thought “Fuck it, this is competition,” and called for 215kg (474). This was 20lbs more than I had ever had on my back before. When I heard my name five minutes later, I stormed out to the bar, bellowed, and walked it out. I was mad as hell, but I knew I couldn’t afford to miss either of the commands. I could feel in my entire body how hard the bar was trying to staple me to the floor, but it went up faster than I dared hope. My lovely assistant didn’t get the aftermath on video, but I went ballistic when I turned around and saw the three white lights. I also got he honor of being the very last squat of the day, because a 60-year-old suited lifter who had squatted 600 on his second attempt passed on his third. I hope the audience who saw me cap off the day’s squatting by yelling like an asshole feel they got their money’s worth. The bench is my least remarkable lift, and it went smoothly. I opened with a conservative 115kg (253) and threw it at the ceiling. My second attempt at 120kg (264) got a red light from the center judge due to a slightly uneven elbow lock, but it passed. I took my third at 125kg (275), a weight I had failed in training a week ago. I gave it just enough pause and pressed it more easily than my second attempt, probably because I had my feet and shoulders positioned better. I had about half an hour until the flight B deadlifts, so I hurried off to take my tenth nervous leak of the day.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/03/1300292606274.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3768" data-permalink="/blog/2011/03/brisket-2/attachment/1300292606274/" data-orig-file="/2011/03/1300292606274.jpg" data-orig-size="151,232" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="1300292606274" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/03/1300292606274.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/03/1300292606274.jpg" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3768" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="1300292606274" src="/2011/03/1300292606274.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="232" /></a></p>
<p>Warming up my deadlift, I could feel some fatigue seeping through my adrenaline shield. I decided that if I could tie my PR of 507, which I had set while completely fresh, I would consider that a victory. I came out for my opener at 210kg (462) and pulled it easily. I asked for 230kg (507) next, and paced a little more. Earlier in the warmup room a lifter who I had been buddying around with all day suggested I try dabbing a bit of talcum powder on my thighs to reduce the friction with the bar, and I may have gotten overzealous with it, because I got the bar within an inch of lockout, and then it slipped forward. Stupid. I walked back to the official’s table to declare my third attempt, and wondered aloud whether I should go up 5kg. Ted Isabella, sitting in the head judge’s chair, looked over while the loaders were working on the bar, saw me hesitating, and said “Jake, stick with the same weight. Work the total, don’t work the ego.” Even considering how small the meet was, I was impressed that he cared enough to pay attention to me personally and advise me. I had seen him do this throughout the day, making sure that lifters who missed lifts understood why they had been red lighted. So I asked for 230kg again.</p>
<p>It was also at this point that I decided to try an ammonia cap for the first time. I was facing the prospect of having to redo what I thought would be my last lift of the day, and getting my blood up one last time after having it up almost constantly for the whole day. I’ve heard many descriptions of the feeling of ammonia inhalants, but I’ll add my own experience: imagine taking a giant gulp of the hardest liquor you’ve ever tasted, then right as you swallow it, K. Konstantinovs runs up and slaps you in the face. I stormed out to the platform, yelling my head off and asking for more crowd noise, then pulled for a ll I was worth.</p>
<p>Once I got it past my knees I knew I had won, and it was just a matter of staying committed to lockout. Putting the bar down and seeing three whites after that was difficult to describe. In the end, I went 474/275/507 for a raw total of 1,256 in the 181 class, and a nice shiny trophy.</p>
<p>Remember when I said I would talk more about the team of high school lifters later? Well, now’s the time; I hold nothing against any of those kids, but their form on all the lifts was absolutely egregious, and for that I can only blame their coach, the one errant turd in the bowl of otherwise delicious punch that was my day. I won’t apologize for blasting him, and because his kids are too inexperienced to know better, I feel like I have to rail him twice as hard on their behalf. This prick, who by the way was practically spherical, has cheerfully taught half a dozen kids to high-bar squat piddling weights in running shoes and knee wraps while looking up so far you’d think there was a porno being projected on the ceiling. For doing this massive disservice to the kids in his care, he deserves to be fined at the very least. About the only good thing that can be said about this clusterfuck was that I didn’t see any of the kids squatting high.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not one of those people who argues that Olympic lifting is better than powerlifting because it looks sexier, or requires more flexibility or balance or eleetness, but I will say this: when you go into a gym where people call themselves weightlifters, you learn the snatch and the clean and jerk properly, and you either follow the same high standards as internationally competitive lifters or you find yourself another gym. Powerlifting would benefit greatly from this kind of quality control. Powerlifting is a great sport, but teaching impressionable kids to do stupid shit is NOT A SPORT, and wrapping your knees to squat 150lbs as your third attempt is definitely not a sport. It seems like some people–not many, but a few–are willing to throw any combination of squishy-shoed, porn-on-the-ceiling squats, sloppily paused bench presses, and butt-ugly deadlifts into a pot and call the resulting gruel “powerlifting”. And that is a damn shame.</p>
<p>To end on a high note, I owe many thanks to Ted and the other USPF officials and lifters who made the meet possible. You are all class acts, I respect the hell out of you and I don’t blame you at all for the actions of this one fool. Thanks are also due to all of my friends who encouraged me or sent me any kind of positive vibes–you know who you are. And to the audience at the meet, I apologize again for screaming in your faces.</p>

  <p>There have been some posts on what music readers like to listen to when lifting, but <a href="/blog/2010/03/damn-it/">this one</a> is the only one worth reading. As I’m typing this, I’m listening to Alice Cooper’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQE0pfBAYQ8">Welcome To My Nightmare</a>” — go ahead and click it if you want the full effect of reading this post (if you don’t like YouTube, go to Playlist.com and search it).</p>
<p>Music can help act as a catalyst for the release of adrenaline, but it can also have a calming effect. It’s incredibly useful to inject a mood when emotion and intensity are low. However, I do believe that music can be a crutch. It denies the necessity to learn how to get psyched up without it, and it also neglects learning how to get relaxed without it. Nevertheless, it’s very useful when training <del datetime="2011-03-15T14:05:14+00:00">and drinking</del>.</p>

<p>Personally, I’m not impressed with the majority of music. I hate most mainstream music and most types of music. I prefer obvious displays of artistic ability, and that isn’t found within pop, emo, U2, or Creed. Additionally, lifters stereotypically prefer metal that has a guy screaming with a horrible guttural noise that is sorta like, but not necessarily the noise I make when I vomit. Again, I’m unimpressed. That doesn’t mean I don’t like metal or any other type of music; you can go ahead and assume that I not only am unimpressed with your favorite bands or songs, but that I hate them.</p>
<p>Hell, who gives a shit what I think? This post isn’t about what I do or don’t like, it’s about what <em>you</em> like. Detail what your favorite type of training music is, and then what specific type of music or songs you prefer on your heavy or intense sets. To me, “training music” would be something that I would enjoy having on in the background during warm-ups or assistance exercises. That is a category that is different than what I consider “squat songs”, or songs that I listen to specifically for squatting really heavy. Post your favorites to the comments. Don’t hesitate to make fun of each other (it’s all in good fun).</p>
<p><em>(You can post YouTube links if you want, but remember that you can get better quality on other music sites like playlist.com)</em></p>
<p>I’ll go first:</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been in a gym that doesn’t have music playing at all, and I don’t use a music device. I psyche up without music, but last night I psyched up <em>thinking</em> about Led Zeppelin’s <strong>Achille’s Last Stand</strong>, which is an awesome ten minute tune with some intense guitar and drum pieces (and is one of my favorite songs overall). I’ve squatted to <strong>When the Levee Breaks</strong> by Zeppelin, <strong>I’m a Man</strong> by Chicago (the first album is solid, down hill after the early days), and most songs from Guns N’ Roses Appetite for Destruction album, namely <strong>Welcome to the Jungle</strong>, <strong>Nighttrain</strong>, and especially <strong>Out Ta Get Me</strong>. With the exception of Sweet Child O’ Mine, that whole album is solid. Most Led Zeppelin is, but I don’t enjoy their stuff that is overplayed on the radio and opt for the more bluesy stuff like <strong>Since I’ve Been Loving You</strong>, but it’s more for laid back training. Also, I really like Billy Idol for lifting heavy. I shit you not, <strong>Rebel Yell</strong> and <strong>White Wedding</strong> get me amped. Other than that, I like most upbeat classic and 80’s rock to have in the background of training. I haven’t heard much metal outside of 80’s metal, but I enjoy Metallica’s early stuff and Motorhead.</p>

  <p>This weekend I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053221/">Rio Bravo</a>, starring John Wayne. The first memory I had of Wayne was at the movie ride in MGM Studios. The ride’s boat rounds a corner, and a mechanized John Wayne is sitting on a horse talking some kind of smack (Side note: I can’t remember if this was before or after the Lieutenant Ripley scene where she was against the wall, panting quickly when one of the aliens bursts out of the wall and scared the living shit out of me at six years old). I really hadn’t seen any of his movies either; they were before my time.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/03/John-Wayne-Cowboy-Poster.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3755" data-permalink="/blog/2011/03/john-wayne/john-wayne-cowboy-poster/" data-orig-file="/2011/03/John-Wayne-Cowboy-Poster.jpg" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="John Wayne Cowboy Poster" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/03/John-Wayne-Cowboy-Poster.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/03/John-Wayne-Cowboy-Poster.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-3755 aligncenter" title="John Wayne Cowboy Poster" src="/2011/03/John-Wayne-Cowboy-Poster.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="320" srcset="/2011/03/John-Wayne-Cowboy-Poster.jpg 400w, /2011/03/John-Wayne-Cowboy-Poster-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p>John Wayne injected the world with masculinity. His gritty determination and “take no shit” attitude embody what 70’s Big stands for. Whether dealing with sassy women or no-good, dirty criminals, Wayne is stern, gruff and righteous. If John Wayne was before your time, I suggest checking out one of his movies. Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAF1DPLIAI&amp;feature=fvst">preview for Rio Bravo</a>. More on Rio Bravo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A small-town sheriff in the American West enlists the help of a cripple, a drunk, and a young gunfighter in his efforts to hold in jail the brother of the local bad guy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  That <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053221/">description </a> fails to mention a good lookin&#8217; <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=angie+dickinson&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1600&bih=704">Angie Dickinson</a> in her prime.<br />
</p>
<p>John Wayne was an icon because of his distinctive voice, walk, and size; he was bigger than most actors and in his movies he often dwarfs his supporting cast (especially when he’s busy hitting them in the face with the barrel of his rifle). His leathery face may not be pretty, but John Wayne is definitely a hard-ass.</p>

  <p>Well, it’s the end of the week. And we were having so much fun! It’s <strong>PR Friday</strong>, so post your personal records, training updates, or whatever else to the comments.</p>
<p>Here’s a little round up.</p>

<p>Choosing not to do things that are optimal for strength, when strength is the goal, is an admission of not wanting to be strong. It also gives me the willies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice Cooper is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>A lot of people got pretty butt hurt about something having to do with Paleo. It’s funny though, in my carb post, the word paleo was present only once, and it was in a quote where I asked Pendlay if his lifters “ate paleo”. I also don’t remember saying that carb sources should be unhealthy or superfluous. Oh, I know — I don’t remember because it wasn’t fucking there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This website is not a place to <em>maliciously</em> bash other websites or people, specifically CrossFit. I realize that the stereotypical CFer is extremely irritating for many reasons (don’t worry, I agree). However, there are a lot of people involved in CF that are good people. I’ve met most of my good friends through CF, and have been to a lot of places around the country that don’t totally suck. Every now and then I’ll poke fun at the stereotypical crowd, and I don’t mind if you do. Just avoid the malicious bashing so that we stay judicious about it. Maybe this analogy will work: CF may be a culture that is weird to you, but it’s the “radical CFers” that give you the bad taste in your mouth. Don’t lay judgment on all of them because there are a few crazy ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personally, I’m pretty weirded out at nutritional zealotry. Actually, I’m weirded out about any zealotry, but that’s neither here nor there. There are plenty of people who survived beyond 90 years old, and even into their 100s, who did not have “optimal diets” (which is a debatable phrase, but we aren’t going there). There are also plenty more people who die much younger and as a direct result of being unhealthy and fat. There are also people who are riddled with cancer without bringing it on themselves (no smoking, no over-fatness, etc.). We could debate these issues all day, but in truth nobody has a comprehensive knowledge to have a good say on the matter over another person (e.g. the bio-chemist lacks the perspective of the evolutionary biologist).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a simple, yet descriptive exercise. Look at what the American government has recommended regarding nutrition over the past 50 years (quick search found <a href="http://www.healthy-eating-politics.com/usda-food-pyramid.html">this</a>). Next look at the trend of obesity rate in that same time period (the graph on <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/trends.html">this</a> page alarmed me as a teenager). It can be assumed that a) the increased carbohydrate recommendations, b) the availability of refined sugars, c) hypothetical laziness, d) lack of knowledge of what is actually healthy, and e) a decrease in physical activity of America (did a quick search on data for this, feel free to find it and post in comments) resulted in a really fat country. As a 15 year old, I was shocked at how Americans could be identified at Disney World because of how fat they were. In any case, shifting carbohydrates away from 60 to 75% of the diet to something that has all three macronutrients providing a similar share of the calories is a significant change to the government recommendations. I’ll point out that in my carb post, I suggested eating about the same amount of carbs as the protein.</p>
<p>I’ve been infatuated with asking older adults (more than 60 years old) who are in good health what they’ve done in their life to result in their healthy disposition. You know what the common denominator is? They have all been active throughout their lives. One simply cited cardio, another likes to climb mountains (big ones around the world), some lifted weights, and others were cyclists. I asked the mountain climber, “Was there ever a point in your life in which you weren’t active?” He didn’t hesitate to say no. He also didn’t go on and on about how his diet made him healthy. Nobody did. They are all folks who are in shape and have never allowed their bodies to be out of shape. The point is that they adopted an active lifestyle that was engaging enough to do it for years.</p>
<p>Since I was about 14 years old, I wanted to be a living testament that physical activity, not getting fat, and a moderately healthy diet would stimulate longevity. Staying strong and able into older age will be dependent on the vigor of an individual. What’s the common denominator among healthy 70 and 80 year olds? They still get around. They are still active, and have the strength to get on the go.</p>
<p>Strength alone isn’t enough, but if it’s compounded with invigorating activity and a decent diet over the years, most problems are eliminated. Yes, this website in particular doesn’t cater skinny guys who weigh 150 pounds. Their usefulness, self-esteem, and athletic prowess can increase with significant strength and muscle increases. Yes, instead of drawing out that process to a 3 year ordeal, it can be accomplished in six months of intense non-healthy eating. Again, I will (take the painstaking patience) to point out that I’ve never suggested someone eat brownies and ice cream every day for the rest of their life. Yes, when someone has significantly higher lean body mass, their nutrition demands to not only maintain that mass, but to also recover from hard training, will be different than someone who isn’t. Furthermore, the demands of a 170 pound guy to a 210 pound guy will be different (this example assumes both have low body fat). Lastly, if that 210+ pound guy doesn’t eat a similar amount of carbs to his protein intake, then he will not lift optimally (among other things, but they digress).</p>
<p>Once a guy wants to level out his body weight, he can begin the process of improving his body composition by cleaning up his diet. We say this on the site all the time. It’s just that compared to other websites, we rejoice in having more strength and muscle.</p>
<p>The body responds to stress — or a lack of stress — that is imparted on it. If you don’t exercise/train for years at a time, your body becomes soft and unadapted. Your neuroendocrine system adapts to a state of “not a lot going on”. Instead, regular exercise and training keeps the structures adapted and keeps all of that chemical and hormone stuff optimal. Nowadays, people want to over complicate everything. Just keep it simple. If you feel unhealthy, then figure out why and do something about it.</p>
<p>People say that being a competitive lifter/athlete and healthy are mutually exclusive. That’s not my belief. A competitive athlete has much higher phyiscal demands, thus they’ll have much higher fuel demands. I have this funny feeling that Dean Karnazes and Michael Phelps won’t be dropping dead at a young age.</p>
<p>Train hard, stay active, eat decently, and have fun. Or just shut up and squat.</p>

<p>A lot of you need to sack up and compete in something soon. f you’re still on the fence, you are <del datetime="2011-03-10T15:56:03+00:00">invited</del> required to participate in the Tactical Strength Challenge this April.</p>
<p><strong>Results will be submitted between March 25 and will end Sunday night, April 17 (there will be a sticky post up).</strong></p>
<p>The events are simple.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/03/6a00d8341ce18a53ef0120a6c593b9970b-800wi.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3743" data-permalink="/blog/2011/03/tactical-strength-challenge/6a00d8341ce18a53ef0120a6c593b9970b-800wi/" data-orig-file="/2011/03/6a00d8341ce18a53ef0120a6c593b9970b-800wi-e1299773098796.jpg" data-orig-size="150,233" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="6a00d8341ce18a53ef0120a6c593b9970b-800wi" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/03/6a00d8341ce18a53ef0120a6c593b9970b-800wi-257x400.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/03/6a00d8341ce18a53ef0120a6c593b9970b-800wi-e1299773098796.jpg" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3743" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="6a00d8341ce18a53ef0120a6c593b9970b-800wi" src="/2011/03/6a00d8341ce18a53ef0120a6c593b9970b-800wi-e1299773098796.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="233" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Max deadlift. You get three attempts to find your max pull. Do it meet-style. If you make an “AC-jump” between your first and second attempt, there is no going back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max pullups. Dead hangs. No chinning (palms must face away), and absolutely no kipping. Kippers will be shot, killed, and then banned from posting here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 min Kettlebell snatch test. You may set the weight down or switch hands as necessary. If you absolutely can’t find a kettlebell, use an equivalent dumbbell and mention that in your results.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3 major divisions are as follows:</p>
<p>Men’s Elite: 10kg weighted pullups, 32kg kettlebell (70lb DB)</p>
<p>Men’s Open: BW pullups, 24kg kettlebell (55lb DB)</p>
<p>You must make a minimum of one deadlift, pullup and snatch or you score 0 in the above divisions.</p>
<p>Women’s Open: BW pullups, 16kg kettlebell (35lb DB)</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that in the heaviest division, strong adult males have a significant advantage because pullup and snatch reps will be lower, thus deadlift contributes more of the final score. Everyone is encouraged to enter the hardest division they can complete. Novice and masters divisions are also available. Full rules and scoring are <a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com/rules.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Perform the 3 events in one session, and rest at least 15 minutes between each, even more if you have time. Perform the TSC and post your results by April 17 on the results sticky which will be up by the end of March. Get your friends that lift to complete the TSC with you and post their results with yours. If you don’t have kettlebells, dumbbells or cool friends there is a <a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com/tsc_locations.asp">list of locations</a> around the world that might be hosting a TSC on April 9. If one’s near you make sure to contact them ahead of time to confirm they’re still on for spring. They’re required to be free and this is a great way to meet lifters in your area and test the waters of competition.</p>

  <p>Newsflash: insulin is the most anabolic hormone in the body. Anabolism is the process where smaller units are made into molecules. For our purposes in training, it means growth and recovery. You can not — repeat, NOT — get optimally strong without it.</p>
<p>When food is eaten, particularly carbohydrates, insulin will release to induce the cellular uptake of substances, particularly glucose (sugar) and amino acids (various effects on metabolism, but most importantly are building blocks of protein). The domino effect of insulin being released induces an anabolic state that is necessary for recovery. During training, muscles are damaged. The stress/adaptation process will not only repair the muscles, but repair them so that they have a higher threshold. The higher threshold culminates in increased strength (when on a proper program). Anabolism is an environment that is necessary for recovery to occur; if the body is wasting away in catabolism (the opposite of anabolism), it can’t help build the structures back up for recovery.</p>
<p>Neglecting carbohydrates dampens the anabolic effect of insulin. Since insulin is such a significant contributor to building the body, its volitional neglect is a decision that says, “I would prefer not to get big and strong right now.” And that’s just fucking weird, folks.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates aren’t the necessity for strength and muscular growth; protein and fat play significant roles in recovery. The point is that you need all three. Neglecting carbs has been a savvy thing to do lately. It’s a result of the demonizing on insulin. Well, guess what? If you aren’t lifting hard — training to get stronger and bigger muscles with compound movements like the squat, bench, press, and deadlift — then insulin is less critical. If you are sedentary or primarily do conditioning workouts — a training emphasis that induces adaptations in the cardiovascular/respiratory systems — then insulin probably should be avoided since it isn’t required for an environment of growth. Let me be clear: training only to get conditioned, by definition, isn’t stressing the body to grow and get stronger. However, someone who wants to get strong (with or without conditioning) will not only benefit from a growth environment, but will need it if they are going to be efficient with their time. It’s the intelligent thing to do.</p>

    Both Alice Cooper and Insulin are not actually evil
  </p>
</div>
<p>I’m not suggesting you have giant carb meals to create an insulin response. People forget that exercise, particularly exercise that induces a state of growth (like lifting) will increase insulin sensitivity. Fish oil also increases insulin sensitivity, and most people that read this site are taking it. You won’t need crazy amounts of carbohydrates to induce a solid insulin response — unless you’re a Skinny-pain-in-the-ass-Guy. I do want to point out that “crazy amounts of carbs” is a relative thing since a lot of people are eating melons, berries, and pine tree bark as their daily carb source (it’s what Lucy ate, after all). Unless you’re a fat person — and you know if you’re fat or not — aim for a similar amount of carbs and protein. You should be eating significant protein compared to your sedentary friends (at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight, and guys need much more than that). Some research would indicate that it really doesn’t matter when you have that protein during the day, but you’ll feel better if eat it throughout the day. However many protein grams you’re eating, eat an equal amount of carbs. For the hard training lifter, that really won’t be a lot. But it is a fuck-ton more than what most of you are eating because you’ve been told carbs and insulin are evil like the Alice Cooper.</p>
<p>Of course you’ll be adding on plentiful amounts of fat along with that diet. Glenn Pendlay told our chat room last Tuesday that he considered fat (with plenty of cholesterol) to be more important than protein (his lifters are obviously getting significant protein — I’d assume well over 1g of protein per pound of body weight). It’s the Grandma Principle in action. The Grandma Principle states that you should eat meals that your grandma would have cooked; whole meals with legit foods like cooked dead animal, vegetables, and potatoes. For more on Granda, go <a href="/blog/2010/06/making-the-cut/">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>On a similar note, I Socratically asked Pendlay, “Do any of your lifters eat paleo?” I knew what the answer was, and he said something like, “Are you fucking serious?” to which I replied, “Fuck no, but that’s the point.” Nobody is going to get strong — and I mean fucking above average strong, not deadlifting 400 — by eating tree bark.</p>
<p>Insulin is the most anabolic hormone. By choosing not to utilize it throughout the day in at least two or three meals is a decision that says, “I don’t want to be as strong as I could be.” It’s analogous to wearing Vibram Fucking Five Fingers in the gym or choosing to squat with the bar on top of your head — it isn’t fucking optimal. And folks, people who make a blatant decision to not be strong give me the willies.</p>

  <p><em>The following was written by Tamara AKA T-Bone on this site.</em></p>
<p>Question: What do you do when your trip to the 70’s Big Workshop gets canceled because your kid has a 102 fever?</p>
<p>Answer: You spend the weekend glued to the computer watching weightlifting at the Arnold and drinking Makers 46.</p>
<p>The 2011 Arnold Weightlifting Championships were streamed live on the web via ustream. This allowed everyone a chance to watch the action…when the feed was working. The feed on Saturday was especially spotty with much of the Women’s Elite session happening while the feed was down. Thanks to ustream you could also join in on the live chat, which on Saturday evening featured some of the biggest douchebags and trolls on the planet.</p>
<p>I missed the morning Friday sessions because I was still hoping that God would intervene and allow me to drive to Atlanta to hang with Real Men With Facial Hair Who Weigh Over 200 Pounds. Sadly, God was not on my side, reaffirming my belief that there is a special place in hell for me. Fortunately, Friday night featured some of my favorite lifters, including three of the four California Strength guys who were competing at the meet. Rob Blackwell went 119/140, Jared Enderton went 141/168, and Jon North went 152/189. Despite being a 77 and lacking significant body hair (although he apparently weighed in at a whopping 79.70) and being French Canadian, Laurent Goyette-Demers impressed me with a 117/155. Little dudes can be strong too, even if they aren’t as hot. The evening wrapped up with quite a surprise. After his third jerk attempt, Jon North whipped out an engagement ring and proposed on the platform.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I was really looking forward to the Women’s Elite Session. Unfortunately, ustream had other ideas. Apparently, getting a better internet connection at the Arnold venue cost $700, which was not in the budget. So, the shitty connection resulted in frozen screens, off-air time, and frustration on the part of viewers. Still, these women didn’t fail to impress. Amanda Sandoval was the winner of the Women’s Open Division as a 58 lifter with an 87 snatch and 110 jerk. Natalie Burgener went 94/103, Aimee Anaya Everett went 88/111, and Jackie Berube went 80/99 as a 58 lifter at age 40. Superheavys Holley Mangold and Chioma Amaechi threw up some big numbers. Mangold went 98/127, and Amaechi went 100/131 to take second in the Women’s Junior Division.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon exhibited the hyped Men’s Islands vs. Mainland competition, which featured Dutch Lowy, Caleb Williams, Chad Vaughn, Phil Sabatini, Zach Krych, Kendrick Farris, and Pat Mendes lifting for the U.S. Vaughn was the winner of the Men’s Open Division as a 77 lifter with a 147 snatch and 183 jerk. He makes me want to try harder to like men who weigh less than 200 lbs. Kinda. After snatching 143 and missing his attempts at 148 and 150, Krych pulled out of the jerk portion of the session as a precaution. Farris hit a 155 snatch and then missed all three jerk attempts at 197. He put up quite a fight on the third attempt and collapsed on the platform. All eyes were on Mendes after the “Unofficial Junior World Record” video of his 207 snatch. I think it’s fair to say that Mendes disappointed. He opened with a 175 snatch and then missed 182 and 183. He power jerked his opener at 207 and then missed both attempts at 217. According to Average Broz, he tore a tendon in his shoulder after that 207 snatch and didn’t lift again until four days before the meet. Despite what anyone thinks, the dude is fucking strong, and he’s just a kid, and I’m ready to see what he can do at Nationals.</p>
<p>Saturday evening had some solid lifting as well, but as stated earlier, the level of douchebaggery on the live chat reached an all time high and eventually drove me to log off. Sunday featured the School Age and Junior lifters. The littlest ones were adorable, even if some of them were easily snatching my jerk PR. Arnold himself made an appearance on stage on Sunday morning, although the shitty sound quality prevented me from hearing what he was saying.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon was what I was waiting for. Okay, not just me…scores of other panting women around the country were also tuned in to watch Spencer Moorman. Apologies to all of the other guys lifting during that session, but I didn’t pay you the slightest bit of attention. And Spence (yes, I will call him Spence) did not disappoint. He hit a 155 snatch and then opened with a 185 jerk. As a Real Man With Facial Hair Who Weighs Over 200 Pounds, he understood the importance of Go Big Or Go Home. Spence knows how to Man The Fuck Up and went for a 192 jerk, although he missed both attempts at that weight. I am sure he earned more than one new fan. As another viewer said, “Guess whose picture is now on my desktop. Who would have thought that I’d ever find a big bear-like man hot as hell?” Indeed. Thank you, Spence. We are all glad that you are legal.</p>

  <p>It was a rough weekend for me given that the three days leading into the workshop I probably ate a combined 1,500 calories (Note: Don’t drink from the water fountain at the park). The 70’s Big Workshop itself was a lot of fun. The updated presentation had more of a focus on programming. I aimed to give everyone the conceptual understanding of programming with guidelines so that they can implement it.</p>
<p>I liked programming to mathematics; there are fundamental rules that create the boundaries for the language, yet once there is a solid understanding of those fundamentals, then you can get creative in how you apply the language to new things (I heard this explained by a quantum physicist on the radio when I was driving Friday — most of us won’t ever have the capacity to be creative with math, but my analogy still makes sense). We did discuss specific programs like various linear progressions and how to program intermediate level trainees, yet I’m more interested with someone understanding the guidelines of creating a stress dose to illicit a response, and knowing how it will effect the system and local structures.</p>
<p>In any case, hanging out with everyone was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>This past weekend also marked the 2011 Arnold Sports Festival, including a weightlifting and powerlifting meet. We’ll have recaps of that over the next few days. If you went to the festival or were watching online, then I’m interested in having you type out a recap post of what you saw. I already have someone doing the weightlifting meet, but shoot me a message or comment here if you want to help out. I drove to Atlanta Friday, did 12 hours of presenting, coaching, and eating food for the workshop on Saturday, then drove back to Florida on Sunday, so I didn’t see any of the Arnold.</p>

  <p>One Wednesday evening I contracted the bubonic plague and have been out of commission since. Tomorrow there will be a workshop in Atlanta — it’s still on of course. List your PR’s or training updates to the comments.</p>
<p>P.S. Puking is not a sport.</p>

  <p>Every day millions of people are doing silly-ass shit in gyms across the world. One of these things includes wearing Vibram Five Fingers to the gym. For those of you who aren’t Californians, CrossFitters, or the outdoorsy type, they look like this:</p>
<p><a href="/2011/03/vibram-fivefinger-shoes.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3707" data-permalink="/blog/2011/03/what-not-to-do/vibram-fivefinger-shoes/" data-orig-file="/2011/03/vibram-fivefinger-shoes.jpg" data-orig-size="419,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="vibram-fivefinger-shoes" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/03/vibram-fivefinger-shoes-400x274.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/03/vibram-fivefinger-shoes.jpg" src="/2011/03/vibram-fivefinger-shoes-400x274.jpg" alt="" title="vibram-fivefinger-shoes" width="400" height="274" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3707" srcset="/2011/03/vibram-fivefinger-shoes-400x274.jpg 400w, /2011/03/vibram-fivefinger-shoes.jpg 419w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>I’ll point out that most people think that these things are…not straight. I can see how they’d say that, but they are useful for outdoorsy shit like rock climbing, kayaking, or wearing to the beach (I know because I was gifted a pair, and I have worn them doing these things).</p>
<p><em>Edit: When I tried explaining this to my girlfriend, who hates the Vibrams, I said, “Well, they are useful for some things–” She interrupted me and said, “What? When you want to put your toe in someone’s ass?”</em></p>
<p>Some people wear them for running (those people are vegetarians or have other unrewarding characteristics such as — and this is a direct quote from my girlfriend — “armpit hair or a huge bush”). I think that wearing them for running is taking the “functional” shit way too far, not to mention running in them is clearly less safe (consider the environment, and accept the fact that the vast majority of people can’t POSE correctly).</p>
<p>“Ohhh, but what about the functionality of aborigines running properly?”</p>
<p>Yawn.</p>
<p>Look, POSE running is good and more efficient. Getting all crazy and doing it in Vibrams indicates you don’t have anything else important to do. Does <a href="http://www.crossfitendurance.com/">Brian MacKenzie</a> wear Vibrams when he races? No. He doesn’t.</p>
<p>More importantly, Vibrams shouldn’t be worn to workout, ESPECIALLY when lifting. Jesus, I see people wearing them to squat in and it makes my teeth hurt. When I see them attempting the Olympic lifts, I have a seizure on the spot. “Functionality” isn’t about trying to do things like the australopithecus did “because we evolved that way”. Functionality is a by product of getting strong, and to get strong efficiently, you wear appropriate footwear. You can run into a host of foot problems by stupidly wearing the Vibrams to lift in. Not only is getting injured not a sport, it’s not fucking functional either. If some shit head can only squat 250 wearing Vibrams, and this other not-so-shithead can squat 450 by wearing a belt and shoes — both of which will help make him stronger, a trait that directly contributes to real world events — then he is much more functional than the first guy. And if he isn’t conditioned from a respiratory/vascular perspective for the “worst case scenario hysteria people”, then he can get more conditioned faster because he is strong.</p>
<p>Vibrams Five Fingers are horrible to lift in. If some fitness ass-burger is telling you otherwise, then you now know they are a burger made of ass. Mechanically they create more problems and don’t solve any, injuries are prevalent (hey, let’s jump and stomp our feet without shoes on with an additional 100+ pounds in our hands — good idea, right?), and they don’t have any merit for optimal strength training. If any of you wear Vibrams, then you should have the money to spring for a cheap pair of lifting shoes. Save the Vibrams for what they were made for: wearing them outdoors when no one is looking.</p>
