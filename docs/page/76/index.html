  <p>Today I was working on a project for this site and sorta forgot to make a post. Here’s a quick hitter.</p>
<p>Here’s a recent video of AC deadlifting 560. I’m pretty sure his meet PR is 568.</p>

  <p>I don’t really need an engaging intro today because I already know that talking about conditioning gets you wet and bothered. Strength is a little more abstract, something you have to follow for a while to get gains. Gaining and losing strength is a slower process. Gaining and losing conditioning happens within days. And you fucking love talking about it.</p>
<p>My friend Johnny Pain from <a href="http://strengthvillain.com">Strength Villain</a> knows you fucking love it, so he put together an e-book that contains 50 conditioning workouts that are Greyskull approved. Interestingly enough it’s called “<a href="http://strengthvillain.com/?page_id=20">50 Greyskull Approved Conditioning Workouts for the Modern Viking</a>“.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/02/conditioning-3.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3564" data-permalink="/blog/2011/02/greyskull-conditioning/conditioning-3/" data-orig-file="/2011/02/conditioning-3.jpg" data-orig-size="300,263" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="conditioning-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/02/conditioning-3.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/02/conditioning-3.jpg" src="/2011/02/conditioning-3.jpg" alt="" title="conditioning-3" width="300" height="263" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3564" /></a></p>
<p>There isn’t any fartin’ around in this book. You get a quick intro on some fundamentals, and then it jumps right into the 50 workouts in no particular order. Each workout has a description and pictures that help explain what is going on or what movement is being done. The fan-favorite Bony makes a self-deprecating appearance throughout the workouts. There are plenty of interesting captions such as this one that references Bony doing a tuck jump: “Bony could teach Buffalo Bill a thing or two about ‘the tuck’.”</p>
<p>The workouts aren’t difficult, and that’s the point. In order to be Greyskull approved they need to be simple (after all, Bony is doing them) yet hard hitting. One example is the 400m run, 100 kettlebell swings, followed by another 400m run. Simple. Tough. Efficient. Testicle building.</p>
<p>You can buy the book <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/?page_id=20">HERE</a> from <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/">StrengthVillain.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Hopefully you are at the point in your training career when you have A) been strength training consistently, B) have recorded your progress in a log, and C) have taken notes on how you feel during that time. The more data you have on subjective feelings and objective progress, the more you can discern whether or not certain events (like binge drinking, not eating enough, staying up all night studying, or participating in the horizontal rambas) have effected your training. You will have learned the difference between regular pain and injury pain (the former can be trained through smartly, the latter should be rehabbed). Now start paying attention to the difference between “not feeling well” and being sick.</p>
<p>“Not feeling well” means you have the sniffles, like a cold. Being sick means you have some kind of bacterial or viral infection. Sometimes you will “not feel well” and it will be the beginning stages of infection — again, you need to learn the difference. It should be pretty clear; having a runny nose, congested sinuses, and a sore throat is different than general fatigue, alternating hot and cold spells, swollen lymph nodes, and general and reverberating body pain. There are many examples of “not feeling well” and infection, but you should know the difference because you’re a fucking adult. The point is that having the “tough guy mentality” in some cases makes you stupid.</p>
<p>Need proof? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK-H6Ll6Z8c">Here</a>. In any case, tough guys are just stupid people trying to make up for their stupidity with perceived machismo. Eventually they’ll fail (e.g. Debo in the movie Friday).</p>
<p>If you have some kind of infection, whether it be viral or bacterial, your immune system is now hampered with a systemic stress. Bacterial infections can be helped along with antibiotics, yet there isn’t any help against viruses. You’ll just have to wait it out and treat the symptoms. We already know that training, especially the bigger lifts that use the most muscle mass (squat, deadlift, cleans, etc.), produces a systemic stress on the body. That systemic stress is needed in order to get stronger. However, when you have an infection you’re body is already straining to reduce a systemic stress. If you add more stress to it via training (whether it be from lifting or conditioning), you’re going to exacerbate the problem with the additional stress.</p>
<p>Look at it this way: if you only have 100 credits that can be spent on recovery (reducing inflammation, healing things, etc.) and a typical workout will require 75 credits to recover from, and you are experiencing an infection that has already depleted 110 credits, you don’t have any credits to use for training, and you increase your defecit. The system is in a weakened state, and then you weaken it significantly more by asking it to do more when it can barely do less. It’s like a nation being trillions of dollars in debt, and then continuing to spend billions of dollars to try and make money — it doesn’t make any fucking sense.</p>

<p>What can you do if you feel that you’re getting sick? I don’t get sick often, but if I feel anything that would indicate a lack of supreme health, stuffy nose or otherwise, I pound water and vitamins. I feel that it has helped me stave off some minor stuff in the past. What if you’re having symptoms of an infection? Obviously don’t go to the gym. We already clarified that it’s stupid because it can fuck you up to the point of hindering progress longer than the original infection would have. While you’re sick, do your best to hydrate and get as much protein in. You’ll have fat and glycogen to use if needed, but you should still try and get protein in. If you have a hard time keeping food down, then do your best. Depending on what you’re infected with, you may feel better the next day. This is not the time to fucking train. I’ve done this in the past and AC just did it the other day (even mildly gloating about it in the PR Friday comments), and now he’s worse off. <strong>I suggest getting two days of good food intake before attempting a training session</strong>. If anything you’d get a surplus of calories and protein in the days when you can finally eat.</p>
<p>When you resume training, you probably shouldn’t “resume it as normal”. You’ve just been in a systemic deficit; why would you think you can train as if nothing happened? Instead, a very intelligent progression would be doing a light-to-medium workout, a medium/moderate workout, then a heavy workout with days of rest in between. It’s intelligent because it’s patient; it doesn’t do too much too soon. Post-infection training is not the time to start back up on a volume day; just get a light workout in. If you feel great and think you can do more, than swallow your pride (your annoying fucking pride) and hold yourself back. It’s always better to be safe than sorry with training and programming.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that you sit out every time you aren’t feeling super. But you do need to be in tune with your body. If you’re thinking the cough is more than a cough, ratchet the workout back or wait till the next day. You now understand that not feeling well and infection are two different things. You know that shit will get worse if you try and train while infected (and you shouldn’t be going to a place where you can infect other people anyway, you dickhead). You know that you can try and manage the sickness by hydrating, getting protein in, and some over-the-counter symptom helpers. You know a pretty good guideline that requires two days of feeling and eating well before training, and you also know that you should slowly progress your training (or your systemic stress) back up to pre-infection levels to optimally resume training. All I can do is tell you this shit. It’s up to you to recognize and react like a smart person instead of a stupid person.</p>

  <p><em>This post is part of a series on the Texas Method. Here is <a href="/blog/2011/01/the-texas-method-part-1/">Part 1.</a></em></p>
<p>Now that there is a general understanding of what the Texas Method (TM) is, what it’s used for, and why it’s useful, we will talk about how to transition different exercises into it.</p>
<p>I have several themes that resonate over and over and over and over and over and over … on this site. The concepts of adaptive stress and individuality mean that in order to drive progress, an adaptive stress must be imparted on the body. However, the magnitude and method of that stress is dependent on a person’s current state of adaptation. Our society likes to group things to make them easier to comprehend; skinny, weak, skinny-fat, big, fat, and strong are ways to describe a trainee. However these distinctions aren’t descriptive enough. For instance, there may be a trainee who has just gotten into squatting and deadlifting, yet has been doing bench and other upper body exercises for years. His bench may be higher than the squat and deadlift; such a body isn’t balanced for performance.</p>
<p>In the case of discrepancies in weight lifted or muscular distribution, it may be prudent to advance certain exercises to intermediate programming instead of a linear approach. For instance, if the squat progression (on a structured linear program designed to make daily gains) has stalled several times, yet the press and bench are still making progress, then the squat could be shifted into an intermediate-style program while the presses continue a linear advancement. The opposite could also hold true. In other words, beating your dick into the ground because “that’s what the program outline tells you to do” doesn’t help you get any stronger.</p>
<p>Similarly, forcing yourself to find the maximum potential of your linear progression won’t be helpful in the long run. For example, I ran my (Starting Strength style) linear progression up to 465x5x3, yet every workout after 450 was purely survival. I vividly remember feeling emotionally wrecked when I finished squatting; I had to summon so much adrenaline just to get through the three sets (with at least 10 minutes of rest between sets) that I was running on empty. Forcing myself into that experience may have been spiritual, yet it wasn’t optimal for my strength development. I spent several weeks putting an unnecessary amount of stress on my structures to the point that they required recuperation as I transitioned into intermediate programming. I subjectively wouldn’t recommend this, but I also wouldn’t objectively recommend it because it blunts progress in the long-term.</p>
<p>The pressing exercises won’t have the same problem because they don’t involve as much muscle mass. A trainee can exhaust their progression many times yet the recuperation time won’t be as lengthy as if the overreaching occurred with squat or deadlift. <strong>Remember: the more muscle mass that is trained by the exercise, the more disruption that occurs</strong>. If you abuse the amount of stress you impart on your body – relative to your current adaptation – then you will cause local, and potentially systemic, problems.</p>
<p>Advancing various exercises to a TM approach isn’t difficult; the first workout is volume-based, the second is recovery-based, and the third is intensity-based. The bench and press will alternate their emphasis every week so that you bench volume and intensity in the same week (and visa versa). On bench week’s recovery day you would press; on press week’s recovery day you would do some light bench. It isn’t difficult and there are plenty of examples in the book <em>Practical Programming</em> (as well as on the internet).</p>
<p>The deadlift is a little bit trickier. I like to have novices deadlift once a week on the same day. I usually like to put it at the end of the week so that it doesn’t disrupt any other squat days and because the weekend allows an extra rest day (the Greyskull Linear Progression drops a squat day and puts the deadlift on Wednesday – this is acceptable). Novices will make progress by doing a single work set of five. Often I see people doing sets across on the deadlift. This will put more volume on the trainee making it hard to recover while using a smaller amount of weight compared to a single set of five. Don’t do sets across; for a linear progression it’s too high of a dose to get the response we want, and it will hamper other training days.</p>

<p>Once the single set of five starts to slow, then the trainee can shift into doing triples. This allows the trainee to continue adding weight on the bar every week while getting a moderate amount of volume. It’s important to note that moving to triples will benefit a trainee who has a decent musculature structure. The fewer reps will move away from the hypertrophy spectrum (5ish to 15 reps) and thus wouldn’t be optimal for someone with a thin back and torso. A smaller person would benefit in the long run from ratcheting the weight back and getting more cumulative deadlift training done with sets of five (there’ll be more on this topic in another post).</p>
<p>If a trainee has shifted into doing triples, the timing will usually work out where they have transitioned the rest of their training into TM-style training. In such a case, I would just keep driving the triples up. The triple reduces a little bit of the volume imparted on the body on the intensity day, yet handles a significant load. If the triples start to poop out, then the trainee could shift into more complicated stuff; ascending singles, singles across, ascending doubles, or doubles across (as well as rack pulls and speed deadlifts — subject matter for other posts and interviews). Of course this all depends on the current state of adaptation and what the trainee’s goals are. As a general rule I like to keep the total reps on intensity deadlift workouts below five (NOT including warm-ups). After all, it’s supposed to be a high intensity and low volume workout. To get appropriate super-compensation from the volume/intensity effect, you’ll need to maintain the weekly fluctuation of those variables, so don’t get excessive volume in on the intensity day.</p>
<p>As you progress you’ll learn what your limitations were in the past and how you currently adapt to stress. Your training records will help provide data that will help you predict how you will adapt to stress in the future. You will become your own scientist as you continue to advance your strength throughout your life. I will continue giving you ideas and tools to use in your experiments. In the next TM post, we’ll talk more about how to manipulate the reps and sets of the volume and intensity days to continue your strength progress.</p>

  <h2 id="a-tribute-to-jack-lalanne">A Tribute To Jack LaLanne</h2>
<p>Jack LaLanne is the godfather of fitness. Over a career that spanned over 75 years he was a popular bodybuilder, an entrepreneur, an inventor, a fitness and nutrition expert, and a ballsy public performer (he was still towing 70 row boats while shackled and hand-cuffed at age 70). He died Monday at age 96. What was the secret of his longevity?</p>

<p>LaLanne was a long-time proponent of regular exercise and proper nutrition. It’s a mantra he would repeat and live throughout his entire life. He also was one of the early voices speaking out for the use of lifting weights, yet he received a lot of criticism.</p>
<p>“<em>People thought I was a charlatan and a nut. The doctors were against me—they said that working out with weights would give people heart attacks and they would lose their sex drive.</em>”</p>
<p>Jack also never ate processed foods and only ate whole foods. Ironically, he thought organic food was pretty lame (the federal government labeling something as “organic” doesn’t mean shit, by the way…most products are hardly different — if at all — from their non-organic counter parts):</p>
<p>“<em>It’s [organic food] a bunch of bull,” he said. “How do you know what’s really organic? Today, there’s all these impurities in the water and the air. The water for the fruits and vegetables has junk in it. If you get enough vitamins and minerals out of normal food and whole grains, and you get enough proteins and exercise (that’s the key), then nature builds up a tolerance to all of these things. It’s survival of the fittest. You can’t have everything perfect, that’s impossible, but the fit survive.</em>”</p>
<p>There was one constant throughout Jack’s life: training and exercise. He attacked it with a consistent voracity that is hard to comprehend (given the number of years he did it):</p>
<p>“<em>I train like I’m training for the Olympics or for a Mr. America contest, the way I’ve always trained my whole life. You see, life is a battlefield. Life is survival of the fittest. How many healthy people do you know? How many happy people do you know? Think about it. People work at dying, they don’t work at living. My workout is my obligation to life. It’s my tranquilizer. It’s part of the way I tell the truth — and telling the truth is what’s kept me going all these years.</em>”</p>
<p>Jack LaLanne may have past away, but his lessons will live on with us. A person should be strong and make it a habit to habitually exercise and eat well. Everything else in life is irrelevant because your wealth is dependent on your health.</p>

<p>“I don’t care how old I live; I just want to be LIVING while I am living!”</p>
<p>________</p>
<p><strong>Afterword</strong></p>
<p>I want to point out that LaLanne opened the first gym in America. He would eventually expand this franchise into over 200 gyms in a time when “going to the gym” seemed foreign. Jack had a TV show for over 30 years that talked about the fundamentals of fitness; hard work and consistency. However, in the 1980s the aerobics boom created the “fast results” mantra that still permeates fitness culture today. LaLanne was pushed out of the spot light because his techniques and advice weren’t sexy or appealing. It’s unfortunate because society’s marketing requirements changed, and Jack LaLanne was left in the dust despite his sound advice and solid track record.</p>
<p>Eventually he would sign this franchise over to Bally Total Fitness. I think this was the right move for Jack, but unfortunately the “gym business” shifted into the falsehood that “bringing people into your gym means you earn money”, instead of Jack’s notion that “bringing people into your gym will allow them to learn how to become fit and healthy”. Jack did create the first gym franchise in America, yet he aimed at helping people (as evidenced by his advocacy throughout his career that lasts twice as long as most American’s lives). Unfortunately the industry shifted away from fundamental concepts like “putting the work in” and “making good decisions”. Instead, that industry aims for contracts, commitments, and cheap marketing techniques. A gym owners true goal is to make money on their investment instead of creating a quality investment that makes money. This is what spurned the horrendously shitty fitness industry that constantly jumps on the bandwagons of fast results, fancy bells and whistles, and obscure rationalization (i.e. muscles don’t get fucking “confused”).</p>
<p>If we learn anything from Jack, it’s that the fundamentals will always be superior to anything the fitness industry can provide. Hard work. Consistency. Good eating choices. These will prevail over anything the industry can throw at us. Yet it isn’t enough for us to know this and mock the industry. Take this fundamental knowledge and gently help your friends and family from the cave of shadows to real knowledge. Just make sure they understand that it won’t be easy. Nothing really is, even if you’re Jack LaLanne.</p>

  <p>There is a new shirt available in the 70’s Big Store that is based on the intensity Chris brings to training. There are days when you go into the gym and you don’t feel your best. Whether it’s because you were up late drinking beer, not eating or sleeping well, or feeling drained from a busy week, you step towards a barbell and start warming up.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll just have a medium day,” you think. But once you put that bar on your back and get a feel for each warm-up, your mindset mutates and develops. 135, 225, and 315. Each set feels easier. Your psychological momentum is rolling in spite of your physical fatigue. Biology tries to convince you it isn’t your day, but you grimace and say, “Fuck it…I’m feeling reckless.” This is what training is all about; conquering gravity in what you previously thought was impossible. Stomping into heavy sets with reckless abandon is something only a crazy person would do. Are you reckless?</p>
<p><a href="http://70sbig.spreadshirt.com/"><img data-attachment-id="3533" data-permalink="/blog/2011/01/reckless/chris_prototype-2/" data-orig-file="/2011/01/chris_prototype1.jpg" data-orig-size="375,420" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Justin&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1295906219&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chris_prototype" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2011/01/chris_prototype1-357x400.jpg" data-large-file="/2011/01/chris_prototype1.jpg" src="/2011/01/chris_prototype1-357x400.jpg" alt="" title="chris_prototype" width="357" height="400" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3533" srcset="/2011/01/chris_prototype1-357x400.jpg 357w, /2011/01/chris_prototype1.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></a></p>
<p>The phrase actually came after Chris squatted something crazy (500×10 or 600×2 — something like that). When asked why he did it, without hesitation he said, “I was feeling reckless.”</p>

<p>I became friends with one of my professors from college named Dr. Dan Czech. Dr. Czech is an interesting person; he has been to 57 countries teaching and coaching baseball camps, has consulted with countless professional athletes, and is fascinated with social dynamics and human interaction. His experience gives him a unique view point on competition, perseverance, and success. Recently Shawn and I met DC for dinner (Shawn has been mentioned in these posts: <a href="/blog/2010/02/shawn-gets-angry/">first</a>, <a href="/blog/2009/10/qa-2/">second</a>, and <a href="/blog/2010/12/lessons-from-a-workout/">third</a>.</p>

  <p><em>My post about Lewis (who benched 445 and squatted 650 this past week) inspired AC to do a write up about his friend and training partner Dustin. The following was written by AC.</em></p>
<p>My friend Taylor Ray got me a job at one of the local bars named RumRunners early Summer last year. I was walking around introducing myself and someone brought to my attention that I hadn’t met Dustin yet. I looked to the other side of the bar and all I saw was a back as wide as a door frame. He turned around and I introduced myself to him and in a deep southern voice Dustin replied “Niiice ta meet ya A.C.” His bear paw engulfed my hand as we introduced ourselves. Standing at 6’1 weighing around 260 pounds Dustin is certainly an intimidating southern gentleman.</p>

    Dustin knew I competed in powerlifting and he began to show some interest. Before our Christmas Break (early December until mid January) Dustin asked if he could start squatting and lifting heavy with me. He came from a Baseball background and had some collegiate playing time so I knew he would have some athletic prowess. Dustin warmed up and quickly learned and hit his first squat set across with 245. Every following set only looked better and easier. Keep in mind that he as not squatted in over 5 years.

    <p>
      <em>Editor&#8217;s Note: When you teach new people to squat on a regular basis, especially when they haven&#8217;t squatted in a few years, they rarely get up above 185 or even 225 on the first day. It&#8217;s not that they can&#8217;t; it&#8217;s because form is important with the low bar back squat and a coach should hold the lifter back to reinforce the technique (along with other reasons, but I digress). </em>

      High-Fiving Dustin can be scary
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  We train together at 180 Fitness down here at Georgia Southern University. He is currently squatting 375 for his sets across and pressing 180 for three sets of five WITH EASE. Although he is not on a strict program such as novice or TM he is certainly making progress fast. He shows great potential and he lifts with passion and desire. I can proudly say that I train WITH Dustin. He is a great friend and one strong SONOFABITCH. Oh, and Dustin claims he can do a back-flip from a standing position. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it , but I will get a video of it soon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Here is a video of him squatting 375 (shitty cell phone quality).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/tGHPd_RwUqg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s note: That set is very fucking easy. It&amp;#8217;s not overly impressive internet material, but the dude is gonna be very strong very soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

  <blockquote>
<p>From yesterday’s comments:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin, do you have any leanings one way or another in squatting two times a week vs. three times a week on a novice program?</p>
<p>–RD</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With most of my answers: it depends. The trainee’s goals should be assessed first. If they only care about strength — and don’t have a tangent athletic goal like football, highland games, etc. — then three days a week will allow them to progress faster. A novice just starting out will benefit from three squatting days to A) establish the motor pattern and B) have another local and systemic stress that will C) increase strength and D) increase muscle. However, that same novice may progress to a point where three days of squatting nears the limit of what they can handle in week’s worth of time. When I was squatting above 450 for three sets of five in three workouts a week during my linear progression, I was miserable. Toeing the line of what is possible isn’t optimal in this case, and squatting two times a week will continue that progression, albeit slightly slower. I’d recommend it for someone in the later stages of their progression.</p>
<p>As for the trainee that has ulterior motives for competition; I may have this trainee squat twice a week and deadlift once so that they retain some recovery capabilities for the practice of their sport. However, this would depend on what phase of training we were in with respect to the competition date or season. Strength gaining would have more of an emphasis the farther away from competition while strength maintenance may be important leading into competition. It would still be dependent on the training advancement of the person; if they were a rank novice (i.e. just starting), they could improve their strength while in the competitive phase. If they are farther along in the progression, maintaining their gains will be the minimum goal.</p>
<p>Answers regarding programming are neither simple nor straightforward. It will always depends on things like goals, current state of adaptation, and recent training history.</p>
