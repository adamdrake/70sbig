  <p>I was talking to someone yesterday about her Olympic lifting programming and the subject of “clarking the bar” came up. Not many younger Olympic lifters even know what “clarking it” even means. I found former US Olympic Weightlifting Team head coach Jim Schmitz’s story on how the coin was termed (<a href="http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Lifts/He_Clarked_It.html">LINK</a>).</p>
<p>(On a side note, I like reading most Iron Mind articles, particularly the older guys who talk about lifting in the early days. There are interesting stories and solid pictures. A small portion of each issue consists of irrelevant or silly shit, but each issue is interesting nonetheless).</p>
<p>To summarize, Ken Clark was a pretty good American weightlifter. However, in the 1984 Olympics Clark pulled the bar to belt high and let go. Twice. In retrospect, Ken will laugh about it nowadays, saying, “Hey, I’ve got a lift named after me.” But the reality is that he bitched out. I don’t mean any disrespect to Clark — there are a million factors that could have played into him clarking the bar — but it is what it is. I’ve coached people who clark the bar, and I hate it.</p>
<p>If a lifter allows themselves to quit on a pull in training, they develop a mental safety net that lets them quit on the lift whenever they doubt it. This self-defeating mindset can cause problems in a meet or any other PR situation. <strong>Do not ever clark the bar</strong>. You’ll let yourself think that it’s okay, and it never is. If the weight feels heavy or uneven, your foot or grip slips, sweat drops into your eyes, or someone walks in front of you, you must continue to explode at maximum capacity and make the lift. Conditions won’t be perfect in a meet. I’ll remind you of my bungle-fuck at nationals when I looked below the judging table, altered my gaze, thus my head angle, and clocked myself in the chin on my opening clean and jerk. Avoid “clarking it” like the plague.</p>
<p>Every single rep in weightlifting has to be a volitional explosion of recruitment; you can’t half ass any of the reps. If you sense that something is wrong with your first pull, then crank the fuck out of it on your second pull and take a shot at it. There is nothing worse than not trying at all, so don’t let yourself even consider the thought of quitting a rep. Nothing is more sickening than not even trying. Teach yourself how to be mentally tough by not clarking the bar.</p>
<p>_<strong>_</strong></p>
<p>Below is a picture of some fuck-head showing a fitness version of a clean pull. When a lifter clarks the bar, they’ll typically get to the point that the fuck-head is in the picture; they’ll get the bar higher than a deadlift, but not really attempt the second pull. I’d much rather someone crank the second pull and take a shot at finishing the lift — you know, actually trying and shit.</p>

  <p>I’ve been asked what I did to “learn what I know” about training, programming, analyzing movement, etc. I’m also routinely asked questions on lifting technique, programming, differences in types of lifts, and other strength related topics — you know, the stuff that this website focuses on. In school I studied things like anatomy, physiology, physics, biomechanics, and how to apply those fundamental courses to basic movement. However, it was after graduating when I really learned a lot. I’ve spent thousands of hours reading material that ranges from subject matter experts in running to Russian Olympic weightlifting research. I’ve also taken life risks that put me in a position to learn from the source, learn quickly, and think critically and objectively. In order for me to accept something as truth (or a hypothesis that is more true than false), I have to be provided proof of its truth or think through every single nuance of the topic and come to a logical conclusion. This is how I function.</p>
<p>One of the things I learned from Mark Rippetoe is how important “being able to think” is. Rip didn’t teach me how to think (I’ve always done so), but helped me realize how important it is not only to things like analyzing movements, but to life. Rip always cited his first Chemistry lab as the most important class he has ever taken because it requires using the scientific method and trial and error (I’m paraphrasing, I’m sure he’s written about it before, but you could ask him). Science helps create an objective, methodical way of thinking for oneself. By regularly doing this, you won’t easily accept authoritarian advice without proof, and it helps you think around subjects. Thinking around a subject can open up possibilities that an outlined, linear, and predetermined process otherwise wouldn’t.</p>
<p>In order to be good at programming, analyzing mechanics, etc., you must “be able to think”. Whatever the situation, you can analyze what is going on, collect as much data as possible, cross-check what you have found with what you have seen and learned in the past, consider the macro and micro effects, and then give an educated opinion on the matter. However, in order to do all this well in the realm of strength and conditioning, you need to have an appropriate background.</p>
<p>The first class we started with in school regarding the Exercise Science and Kinesiology field of study was Anatomy and Physiology — and for good reason. If you don’t know how the body is put together or how that body functions, then you can’t apply it to anything. Unfortunately most training certifications or coaches have a rudimentary knowledge of this field (and, admittedly, the same goes for most of the people that were and are in my major). You won’t need to know all the nuances of the endocrine system or the gastrointestinal tract, but you absolutely need to know where things are located in the body.</p>
<p>If you can’t determine what muscle someone has hurt (when you’re coaching them), you can’t explain why you’re doing a lift a certain way, or you don’t know what it is you’re trying to stress when implementing conditioning…you are failing. We’ve all heard how the fitness industry is failing, so I’ll leave it at that. Instead I want to talk about the first step: anatomy.</p>
<p>Anatomy is the map of where everything is. By knowing where everything is, you’ll know how the body uses these things in order to move. If you’re going to program for yourself or other people, this should be second nature (90% of the time it isn’t). The best way that you can learn muscular and skeleton anatomy is by picking up bones, touching them, and learning everything about them. Doing so would give you the knowledge of where tendons, ligaments, and other structures attach and articulate. From there you learn muscles and where they attach on those bony landmarks. After learning the micro anatomy you can understand the big picture in “macro anatomy”, or applying it to holistic movement. Unfortunately cadavers creep people out (not me, I’ve held a human heart in my hand in complete wonder) and plastic casts of bones are only found in schools, so that puts most of you at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Until recently I had to recommend muscular anatomy books that were made for physical/massage therapists to help people with anatomy. These books are excellent, but it augments the knowledge gained from the initial hands-on learning process and are more valuable in the field. There wasn’t really a book that did a good job of teaching “from the bone up” while bringing it all together with gross movement patterns. Until now.</p>

Dr. Lon Kilgore had been working on this anatomy book for years, and probably had dreams of creating it while he received his doctorate in Anatomy and Physiology from Kansas State University. Lon is an excellent artist and drew all the pictures in the book, took all the photos, created all the diagrams, and wrote all the chapters. He formulated this anatomy book from the bone up.</p>
<p>This book is particularly useful for coaches, trainers, and trainees in strength and conditioning. Lon teaches the bony landmarks, shows where the muscles are, then has in-depth discussions on the most efficient ways to train the musculature. Lon is a teacher at heart, and the book is entirely focused on teaching you anatomy, fundamentals of movement, and coaching by having repetition in text, pictures, photos, and diagrams. If you have had a vague interest in anatomy or you are a coach/trainer, I wholeheartedly recommend this book to boost your knowledge of anatomy and human function.</p>
<p>Besides, if you all read it, I wouldn’t have to go over the fundamentals so many times when I explain things.</p>

  <p>Some of you don’t fully comprehend the genetic variation in the human race. Some of you have even said you have never seen anyone squat four or five wheels (405 and 495 respectively, sir). Being sheltered isn’t your fault, but understand that while hitting a 405 squat for the first time in your life is a big deal to you, it really isn’t that much weight. I’m speaking for myself here as well. I’ve squatted for ten years, will probably never weigh under 200 pounds again (even at dangerously low body fat percentages), and will always be able to squat 400 pounds any day of the week (barring injury, death, etc.). This pales in comparison to someone who is truly genetically gifted.</p>
<p>I was training with my girlfriend in the Tyndall AFB gym and was going back and forth between benching and coaching her on squats when I see this big guy scavenging 45 pound plates. His bar is loaded to 135 for deadlifts and he has five other plates lying on the floor on each side. For those of you who haven’t loaded a bar that high, six plates on each side would be 585. The girlfriend keeps warming up and this guy does a few sets of warm-up with his 135. Finally I walk up to him, he takes his headphones off, and I ask, “Are you gonna pull all this weight?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“That’s fucking badass.”</p>
<p>Lewis is his name, and he told me he was hoping to single over 600. Lewis is about 295 pounds with a thick back and long, muscled arms; he looks like a deadlifter. I would eventually find out that this was his second “heavy day” in almost half a year. His first heavy day he squatted 600 for a double. Previously he would kind of dick around with body building workouts; you know, squat 405×15, a “regular” workout. Oh, and I forgot to mention that two months ago he weighed 245. In two months he gained 50 pounds back up to his comfortable 295 (while it was a big weight gain, he had to eat vegan to get down to 245 for some training, so when he resumed normal eating habits he got back up to his current weight pretty quickly….but still….).</p>
<p>In any case, Lewis was deadlifting and I watched and filmed him. I gave a little instruction, but he did pretty well (had some minor positional issues). The bar doesn’t swing forward and he does a good job of keeping it against his legs. I was also amazed that he didn’t have the common physiological problems that are associated with not lifting heavy; increased vascular pressure due to intra-abdominal and thoracic pressure increases will cause “white outs”, black outs, or extreme pressure in the head; a lack of motor neuron efficiency will usually have a tut-tut-tut lockout as the hamstrings try to intermittently reduce the tension placed on them when extending the hips; and muscular structure can get fatigued very quickly when it isn’t adapted to heavy lifting. Lewis didn’t have any of these issues. He just deadlifted like a fucking man.</p>
<p>The video has horrible quality because we recorded it on the “text messaging setting”. I didn’t realize it until we are done, but I’m sure I’ll get some better quality stuff of Lewis in the future. After deadlifting, Lewis hit up some RDLs and started doing pull-ups after I suggested he do them. What he did next may have been more impressive than pulling a random 615 single; he fucking did 10 pull-ups with more ease than a 160 pound CrossFitter (and you KNOW he didn’t kip, swing, or spaz out). It was literally effortless. Girlfriend was amazed. I then made the comment that he could do a weighted pull-up with 100 pounds (I was using a mere 50 pounds for reps).</p>
<p>“Let me try that out,” he said as he put the dip belt on. Again, he took his grip, and effortlessly did three reps before setting his feet down.</p>
<p>“It’s kinda light.”</p>
<p>“No shit,” I said, “Let’s put on the 100 pound plate.” He agreed, and I brought it over to him.</p>
<p>“I think you can get at least three reps.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get six.”</p>
<p>I laughed at the absurdity of this 295 pound dude banging out pull-ups with 100 pounds hanging from him. Lewis ended up doing four reps, but he probably could have done six. At the risk of embarrassing Lewis any more (he’s a huge fan of the site, as are his other buddies in the Air Force — shout out those guys; keep training hard and get your ass out of the ’90s), he really does possess abnormal genetic potential. Now he wants to harness that potential, breed it, and win in powerlifting. He’ll be at military nationals in San Antonio. Oh, and he won’t let any kind of PT test get in his way; he said that at his current body weight his waist circumference is about 37 inches (this made Mike want to kill himself because he’s lucky to get down to a 38 inch waist after cutting from his walking weight of 250 to 260).</p>

  <p>I’ve been moving, so there isn’t gonna be much of a post today. I’ve got lots of things planned for you guys including more TM-related posts, interviews, videos, and maybe even that podcast idea. Post your PR’s, training updates, questions, or musings to the comments and I’ll reply to them whenever I have internet this weekend. Have a good’un.</p>

<p>This is what Brent looked like when I met him:</p>
<p>Here are Brent’s squat attempts in a meet we did at WFAC in February of 2009. Brent hits 180kg for his last attempt. He has since hit around 210kg in a meet (sorry Brent, can’t remember).</p>

  <p><strong>Note: If you are an SOF operator, I’m interested in having you join other operators in a group where we can talk about different aspects and issues regarding physical training and requirements to optimally perform (among other things).

<p>I get to meet a lot of people through this site, and one of them is The Scott (I don’t know how this name came to be). The Scott has e-mailed with AC and I over the past year, and he has had some great improvement in his strength. The Scott trains at Ian Carver’s <a href="http://www.crossfitcenturion.com/">CrossFit Centurion</a> where we did a workshop in August. Scott is a stocky dude at 5’9″ and weighed 216 for this meet. If I remember correctly, he was informed of it just a couple weeks ago (meaning he didn’t have a significant taper).</p>
<p>I helped him out with choosing his attempts before the meet (actually it was when we did the 70’s Big Chat Room last week) and gave him some general advice. Well, The Scott went 8/9 and PR’d on squat and deadlift.</p>
<p>Squat 456.5lbs PR</p>
<p>Bench 325lbs</p>
<p>Deadlift 501.5lbs PR</p>
<p>Total 1283lbs</p>
<p>In his last e-mail he told me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In just over a year since following 70’s Big, my squat went from 320 to 456.5 (+ 136.5lbs), bench 315 to 365 (+ 50lbs), and deadlift 370 to 501.5 (+ 131.5lbs). Thanks again for all your help and correspondence. I’m looking forward to 2011.</p>

  <p>At the end of 2009 Gant had a solid idea to force some of you to commit to…something. He called it “Letter of Intent Day”, and it was supposed to incite some of you to figure out what your training goals were for the near future (first half of the year at least). A lot of you responded with quasi-vague goals that sorta pissed me off. Go to the bottom of <a href="/?p=972">this post</a> and read Gant’s goals for 2010 (for good measure, read the <a href="/?p=1111">second post</a> too). His goals were specific to the point that there was no question whether or not he would accomplish them or not. He didn’t set a time line for his annual goals (the goals were varied to the point where they couldn’t all be done at once), but most of you should.</p>
<p>Also notice how the emphasis is on competition. Lifting in your local gym or your garage is okay, but it doesn’t place demands on you the way that competition does. It requires that you funnel your training into a single event that is judged by officials who have a standardized way of critiquing you. Even if you were to compete in mountain biking (one of Gant’s goals last year), you would still be put in a vulnerable position where you are competing against other people…for real. Right before the starting gun you will feel a surge of adrenaline and increased heart rate whether you are about to start pedaling, squatting, or running. Do yourself a favor and commit to some kind of competition related goal this year. How you place is irrelevant; it’s how you perform under duress and how you improve. Gym PR’s are not the same thing as meet PR’s. It’s time that you learned why.</p>
<p><strong>Post your specific goals to the comments.</strong> I don’t care about hearing that you want to squat 400 or 500 pounds this year — tell me what you plan on doing in a meet. Training is irrelevant — by definition it implies it’s simply the process of working towards an end goal.</p>

  <p><strong>Post your own conditioning workouts and I’ll tell you whether they are useful or not.</strong></p>
<p>With the advent of CrossFit and other various conditioning methods out nowadays, the average trainee or lifter think they have a good grasp on conditioning. Personally, I don’t like most suggestions readers make for their programs for various reasons. Instead of giving you guidelines for conditioning (I’ve done this before and will do so again more specifically in the future), this post will give you an opportunity to post conditioning workouts that you would use in a strength and conditioning program.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have to clarify, but there are two such versions: 1) a program that aims to increase strength while maintaining or improving conditioning and B) a program that aims to maintain strength while improving conditioning. #1 is the case of a person who still needs to get stronger and wants to add some conditioning in OR an athlete in their off-season who is increasing their strength base; #2 is someone who is already strong — they are fucking cocked-diesel, or have more than adequate levels of strength for their sport/activity — or someone who is in sport preparation and needs to add conditioning in.</p>
<p>So, post your conditioning workouts and I’ll grade them out on their usefulness in a program while making other relevant notes.</p>

<p><strong>PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>If you’re new to the site, Friday is the day where you can gloat. Post your PR’s to the comments. They can be lifting, eating, tossing, or cloth ripping related. If you didn’t hit any PR’s, then give everyone an update on your training. The regular posters will remember your name and mostly say nice things, and the lurkers will continue to creepily stalk you. Fun!</p>

  <p>You should notice a trend in my advice and opinion on training; illicit an adaptive stress to improve. A person who hasn’t done serious and consistent strength training will benefit from a Linear Progression (LP). There are different kinds of LPs, but the best will have a given set and rep scheme and will increase the load each workout. An LP will allow one day of rest in between training days and will typically average three training days per week. Some very good LPs include Starting Strength (SS) and the Greyskull LP (from Greyskull Barbell).</p>
<p>When a trainee can no longer recover after resetting several times, they will need to upgrade their programming to something more complex. The trainee is unable to adapt on a daily (by workout) basis, and must now shift into a weekly adaptation. During this time the trainee needs to specify some kind of goal; the goal will begin to funnel the training. That’s why I like to recommend that people compete; it continues the funnel into a spout that ends in competition day. In any case, a good next step for a trainee is upgrading their program to the Texas Method (TM).</p>
<p>The TM is designed to create a stress with higher volume, and then express the adaptation and further the stress with intensity. The by-the-book program (from the book, “Practical Programming” by Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore) is</p>
<p>Monday — 5×5</p>
<p>Wednesday — Light work, commonly 80% for 2×5</p>
<p>Friday — 5 rep max (5RM)</p>
<p>Many people see this and implement it in all situations. If a person has come off of a LP, particularly SS, then this is a good transition. However, it works best as a general strength program and will be better off if modified for most trainees. When I use the term TM (I usually say “a TM set-up”), I imply a program that manipulates volume and intensity to yield a weekly progression. This means that you don’t have to be locked into the above template. After the beginning phases of any LP, <strong>there is no cookie cutter program</strong>. One-size-fits-all doesn’t apply to the human body because each individual is full of variances and peculiarities, and this is why programming is an art. It’s also why I bitch about needing more information if you ask me a question on pretty much everything (I do this all the time; my friends and girlfriend sometimes get annoyed). Most people don’t implement programs very well because they don’t know how to modify them for their own goals or situation. Tweaking the TM will be a focus in subsequent posts on the TM.</p>

<p><strong>What is the TM good for?</strong></p>
<p>The TM is a very good general strength program. It continues an appropriate dose/response of tonnage on the body while moving along the upper limit of stress that the body can handle (the latter references experienced trainees who have been on the TM for a few months). A proper LP will have established a good body size, and the TM can continue to build and refine mass, although it is not optimal. However, properly positioned assistance exercises can help increase the size of some body parts that may have been neglected during an LP (barbell curls, weighted dips, power shrugs, and neck harness being the best options for size).</p>
<p>The TM is also a good off-season strength program. Season athletes, those that compete in a sport with designated seasons of competition, will benefit from re-establishing or improving their strength base before getting into a strength maintenance and conditioning phase. It is also possible to switch early novice lifters (those who are on a LP) to a TM set up for various reasons. I have done so in trainees who have anatomical issues (typically asymmetry) as well as to has out subtle form issues — mostly in females in either case. I’ve had a trainee increase on a LP, yet had pelvic asymmetry (rotational scoliosis in the lumbar) to the point where a 3×5 volume three times a week was giving her problems. Instead, we switched to a TM set up; the volume 5×5 (and lower weight) allowed us to work on positional issues as well as conscious neurological innervation, and the intensity day of heavier weight allowed us to push the weight up without worrying so much about the technique. I have several other examples, but the point is that forcing a LP in spite of problems is going to exacerbate things.</p>
<p>The TM is great at continuing to establish a base of strength and can be tweaked for powerlifting competitions, but it has some drawbacks.</p>

<p><strong>What is the TM <em>not</em> good for?</strong></p>
<p>TM is not a good program for Olympic weightlifting — straight up. There is no way you can get appropriate work in the Olympic lifts (anything over 80% on a regular basis — i.e. each training session) while maintaining a good 5×5 to 5RM squat program. It just doesn’t work. I’ve tried, and I probably recover better than you. If you aim to compete in Oly, then switch to it. In my run up to going to senior nationals, I used the TM to get my strength back up after a low back injury, but it didn’t leave me with much time to focus on the Oly lifts for nationals (only five or six weeks). In any case, don’t attempt a TM while trying to get good Oly work.</p>
<p>Additionally, the TM is not a very good program if you need to get conditioned. This should be obvious, but when you’re training for strength it obviates for conditioning since conditioning will take away from recovery capabilities. Conditioning can be added to the TM, but it’s placement should be careful as not to interfere with strength (this principle is necessary in any strength and conditioning program).</p>
<p>TM consists of a lot of stress. If you’re doing it to get as strong as you possibly can, it is not easy. Eventually it will take seven to ten minutes of rest in between the 5×5 sets on volume day. The 5×5 can sometimes be a survival based workout (my most poetic moments when lifting, aside from the Olympic lifts, were on volume squat day). Not many people can handle it and not many people should. If you aren’t serious about competing — meaning you aren’t serious about eating, sleeping, recovery, mobility, and doing everything you can to improve in all aspects — TM will become too much for you. If you are an older guy (let’s say around 35 and up), then you will probably find that a TM set up is too much on your body. A good, hard TM is a young man’s program. The lifters who have had the most notable success using it (arguably limited to the people involved in this website) are all young and reckless. If your body can’t handle it (which is not the same as your mind handling it), then tweak it or change the overall program. If you admit that you don’t eat or sleep well, there are other programs that will help make progress, albeit slower progress for your capabilities (Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 is wonderful).</p>
<p>The utility of a TM set-up is very useful if you know how to tweak it, and use its principles for your goals. Remember, a program is supposed to work for you. In a TM set up, it aims to manipulate volume and intensity to improve strength. This doesn’t necessitate a 5×5 volume day and a 5RM intensity day, and in future TM posts, we’ll learn why and how to tweak it for your needs and goals.</p>
