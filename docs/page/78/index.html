  <p>Dr. Lon Kilgore is a patient, intelligent, and innovative man who continuously campaigns against conventional fitness wisdom and has mentored plenty of lifters, graduate students, and schmucks like me. He is releasing a fantastic — and incredibly practical — anatomy book entitled, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Without-Scalpel-Dr-Kilgore/dp/0615390722/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1294254170&amp;sr=1-1">Anatomy Without A Scalpel</a></em>. This book is not only well put together with unique photos and drawings (Lon is an excellent artist on top of having a doctorate in anatomy and physiology), but it also features me as one of the models (no speedo, sorry). Dr. Michael Hartman was a graduate student of Dr. Kilgore and interviewed him about this textbook. Here are Dr. Hartman’s Blog and Dr. Kilgore’s <a href="http://killustrated.com">store</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Without-Scalpel-Dr-Kilgore/dp/0615390722/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1294254170&amp;sr=1-1">book</a>, <a href="http://www.ironunderground.com/blog/">blog</a>, and <a href="http://www.lonkilgore.com/">site</a>. I highly recommend the anatomy book and hope you enjoy the interview. If you have any questions, you may leave them in the comments (I can get a response from Dr. Hartman or Dr. Kilgore if they are good questions).</p>
<p><em>The following is quoted from part I and part II of Dr. Hartman’s <a href="http://doctorhartman.blogspot.com/">blog</a> that hosts this interview in its original form.

<p><strong>On how this book can help a trainer or coach:</strong></p>
<p>A trainer should be able to use the information presented to produce a better and more efficient training plan for their charges. You would not ask a mechanic to supercharge your engine if you knew they did not know how your engine was built, how it turned the wheels, or what tools they needed. A trainee is paying the trainer to “supercharge” them and it is incumbent on the trainer to know the nuts and bolts of both the trainee’s body and the tools (exercises) they use.</p>
<p>A trainer should also end up being better able to identify which muscle or anatomical feature is presenting pain or soreness during or after training. If you don’t know anatomy, you can only guess at the site of the problem or hope that you can create a solution that works. Anatomical knowledge takes out guesswork and prompts correct solutions.</p>
<p><strong>On how this book helps a trainee:</strong></p>
<p>A trainee that trains himself would reap the same benefits as a trainer. Their exercise selection, programming, and assessment of problems will improve. For a trainee who is paying a professional trainer, it can serve as a means of assessing whether the trainer is providing your money’s worth.</p>

<p><strong>On the content of the book:</strong></p>
<p>The book is 324 pages – 310 pages of chapter content. I believe there are about 525 individual photographs and illustrations. About 1/3 pencil illustrations and about 2/3 photographs.</p>
<p><strong>One (very good) reason why this book is different:</strong></p>
<p>The other difference is in the level of explanation. The most popular exercise anatomy book in print has about 400 illustrations on less than 150 pages. Its just images with bullets and blurbs of text – very pretty images though. I’ve added a great deal of explanation on how to find the various anatomical structures along with information on why they are important and how they function in the real world.</p>

  <p>Haven’t been on a computer much over the holidays (except to post on this site). Traveled yesterday, so I don’t really have anything for you today. There will be a chat room today at 5:00 EST (it will be done before tonight’s bowl game).</p>
<p><a href="http://widget.mibbit.com/?settings=d979218505a306cbee7d9302470fe159&amp;server=irc.synirc.net&amp;channel=%2370sbig">Chat Room Link</a></p>
<p>Note: When you enter the room you have the option of changing your name. Go ahead and change it lest you get a generic name.</p>
<p>If you have Facebook (and can get on at work), then check out the 70’s Big Fan Page (small updates are posted there on a regular basis).</p>
<p>Otherwise, let’s use the comments to talk about whatever. I’ve been mulling over some different ideas for the site, including a short podcast. I’ve got some video to edit from hanging with AC as well as Texas Method posts to write. Here’s a picture of:</p>

  <p>My mom likes to leave the tv on as she goes through her morning routine. One show called “The Doctors” pissed me off this morning. For those of you who don’t know, there is a medical doctor, an OBGYN, a plastic surgeon, and a pediatrician. Today they were giving fitness advice, and it was a fucking joke. Let me clarify something: just because you are professionally called a Doctor — even if it’s a Doctor that treats the human body — it doesn’t mean you know dick about fitness or exercise.</p>
<p>These hosts of the show were demonstrating some kind of vibrating machine that you stand on. The main host, who is a young pencil-neck medical doctor, was sitting on this vibrating machine and said that it “really engages your abs”. I started cussing at the TV. A second later he pulled out a shake weight, and I left the room. Later, the OBGYN — who, by definition, inspects vaginas — was telling people to do wall sits in order to build muscle and burn fat (not to mention her own knees weren’t at a 90 degree angle, which was one of her requirements in her “explanation).</p>

<p>Here’s the problem: we all know that this stuff is bullshit. I can make fun of these idiots every day, but it won’t matter because the viewers that buy into this malarkey don’t know the difference. It’s your responsibility to educate other people on what is or isn’t worth a damn. That means it’s your responsibility to learn not only “what to do”, but “why to do it”. I try to go over this stuff regularly so that you’ll have a conceptual understanding of the “why”, but I only reach three or four thousand people a day. There are millions — fucking MILLIONS — of people who now think wall sits will build their glutes.</p>
<p>I don’t want you go about this like an asshole, though. You need to respectfully inform — you know, teach them. If you go and say, “Oh, that’s a bunch of bullshit. You need to do this”, then you just drive people away. You owe it to people in your life, particularly those that you care about, to help them get on the right track. They all aren’t going to start squatting two or three times a week, but if they learn why compound strength movements not only build muscle, but that muscle helps burn fat, they may want to change their habits. But then again, most people are hopelessly stupid with their health. We can still try to help anyway by teaching, not bashing. Good luck. I’m here if you need help on how to do it.</p>

  <p>I’m going to be hiking with my pup early Thursday morning, so here’s a quick Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>From yesterday’s comments, aramirez asks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading about conditioning brings up a question I have had since I read the longevity and being active article a few weeks ago. I sit behind a computer all day. I train three times a week doing the main lifts (squats, press, bench press, deadlift, etc). No cardio, no conditioning. My cousin who is a conditioning/strength endurance guy, says that heavy weight training alone three times a week is not enough to maintain overall health. He says even though my strength and muscle mass is increasing, my cardiovascular health is not being trained therefore I am still prone to cardiovascular issues. Is this true? Taking extrinsic factors such as smoking, drugs, family disease history, etc. out of the picture is a cardio training component needed for overall health and longevity, or is weight training three times a week enough?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first question I have is, “What is aramirez training for?” I get tons of questions — so much that I have been backed up on e-mails for a couple months now (the chat room is a way to get an immediate response). Over 90% of the questions are vague to the point that I can’t answer them without asking questions in return. If you are trying to get advice on inducing adaptations in your body — whether it be programming, exercises, food intake, injury issues, recovery issues, “mobility” issues, etc. — then I’m gonna need adequate information to give you an opinion on the matter. “Adequate information” means what you’re training for, what you’re currently doing, and current state of adaptation. Perhaps you don’t know how to identify some of those things (I guess I’ll give them operational definitions later), but make an attempt if you want a quicker, more concise answer.</p>
<p>With that being said, I will go ahead and assume aramirez here wants to get stronger while at the same time maintaining good health. He may participate in some kind of strength-related competition at some point, but we’ll go ahead and assume it’s a hobby. I’ll also go ahead and assume he isn’t “hardcore bulking” — a term I will use to explain someone who is completely committed to gaining weight (with a properly volumed program) quickly. People who should be “hardcore bulking” are skinny guys who are 90’s Small (it makes them more likeable). In any case, we’ll assume aramirez is your average strength training guy who wants to continue getting stronger with consistent barbell training over time, but wants to be healthy and doesn’t want his health to suffer.</p>
<p>In such a case, yes, conditioning is in order. Now, I don’t know what his cousin does (I don’t care), but aramirez doesn’t have to do anything fancy to maintain health. This is why retired or older lifters love the prowler so much; it’s something that stimulates their cardiorespiratory and vascular system to produce an adaptation, but it isn’t something lame like “jogging” or a LSD type endurance. It’s important to note several things:</p>

<p>A guy who just wants to maintain health doesn’t need a whole lot of conditioning, and doesn’t really need more than a day of <em>effective</em> conditioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prowler meets the qualification of #1, but the prowler is also a supreme conditioning tool that can help a trainee obtain high levels of conditioning ability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prowler isn’t a requisite. You can use your car, assuming someone is behind the wheel and/or you aren’t rolling it towards a cliff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pushing things like a prowler or burning vehicle aren’t the only options. You can do higher rep sets on timed intervals with big lifts (think squat, deadlift, and power cleans). You can do barbell complexes. You can do lower rep callisthenic complexes. You can run intervals. You can combine these things with jumping if you want to feel more athletic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, some conditioning work will be helpful to maintain cardiovascular/respiratory health. No, you don’t need to think really hard on what to do or when to do it. Just throw it after one of the harder workouts, but don’t put it on a day before a harder workout (even if it’s your rest day from lifting). One day a week is fine for a guy who just wants to maintain. Two or three workouts can be used by a guy wanting to build a little conditioning. Four days a week is not necessary, unless you’re training for something. The priority is keep it short and intense, and don’t interfere with your lifting. If you disrupt recovery for strength training, then you are this guy:</p>

  <p>I’m out and about, so here’s a quick thought. In the chat room last night there was a mild discussion on nutrition. Someone asked how to lose their gut in order to get stronger. Realistically, if you’re unhappy with your bodyfat (if you’re fat, and everyone knows it), then you need to make modifications in your overall diet. If you’re still eating processed foods, drinking soda, and eating sugary foods, then doing any kind of fat loss diet is irrelevant. Drop the shitty foods from your regular diet and then get your macronutrients under control. If you don’t know what that means, then you have some reading to do. If you are skinny or fat, you have done something your whole life to be skinny or fat. Therefore, you have to do things differently to no longer be that way. Start the overhaul now.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Hartman joined us in our chat last evening and was particularly helpful with Olympic weightlifting questions. <a href="http://doctorhartman.blogspot.com/">This is his website/blog</a> — there will be new additions in the new year (updates slowed as the professor obligations increased in the fall semester).</p>
<p>Lastly, go and read yesterday’s post. That concept needs to be reiterated to a lot of people.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Edit: Chat room tonight at 5:00 PM EST. <a href="http://widget.mibbit.com/?settings=d979218505a306cbee7d9302470fe159&amp;server=irc.synirc.net&amp;channel=%2370sbig">Here is the link</a>. Questions welcome.</em></strong></p>
<p>One mistake that people make is programming higher loads with explosive exercises in conditioning workouts. We must remember the point of conditioning: to impart an adaptive stress on the body so that it improves the efficiency of substrate delivery and utilization. Such a stress needs to occur at as much of the body as possible. Exercises that utilize a lot of muscle mass extinguish a lot of substrates in order to perform the movement. When sustained with high intensity, a deficit in substrates occurs. This deficit is the adaptive stress because the body isn’t accustomed to not having them (sitting at your computer all day doesn’t use a lot of energy).</p>
<p>While using exercises that develop power is an important part of a strength and conditioning program, they do not induce power adaptations when used in conditioning. Power aims at moving a moderate to heavy load as fast as possible; this speed recruits close to the maximum number of motor neurons and improves the efficiency to do so. However, during a conditioning workout the muscles are in a fatigued state; muscles are unable to maintain a given output. They won’t be able to utilize a maximum number of motor neurons because they lack the ability to do so at that moment. Thus, power is not developed when in a fatigued state. Power movements – cleans, snatches, jerks, etc. – should instead be used in conditioning workouts for their propensity to exhaust substrates quickly. One aim of conditioning is to reduce substrates, like oxygen, in the biological environment. The power movement should be used in a way so that it contributes to the deficit in substrates instead of a false-held belief that it helps make a trainee powerful.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Some trainees</em> can <em>build power when conditioning, but these trainees are weak and unadapted. Any real athlete would have adequate levels of strength and power to the point that they won’t reap any power benefits when conditioning.</em></p>

    Ingrid Marcum doesn't gain power from conditioning, and neither will you
  </p>
</div>
<p>Practically speaking, if someone has a 1RM power clean at 250 lbs., and 220 lbs. power cleans are programmed into a conditioning workout, that individual won’t be able to perform the reps very fast. This limits the intensity, or more specifically the demand of substrates, of the workout since the reps can’t be done consecutively. More time in between reps allows the body to recover – substrates move away from the deficit zone and become plentiful again – and reduces the adaptive stress. Since power isn’t effectively developed when in a fatigued state, and attempting heavier loads is going to reduce the adaptive stress, why bother? If the programmer wants a speed element (speed being a relative term; in this case faster than other conditioning movements – body squats for example), then he can achieve this element by reducing the weight so that the individual can move the load through a desired range of motion quickly during the rep and with less rest time between reps. Energy output and substrate deficits would be maximized, and the adaptive stress is both efficient and effective. This applies to different types of conditioning workouts, whether they aim to sustain maximum output for as long as possible or repeat bouts of maximum output with programmed rest.</p>
<p>Sustained work at heavier loads may be an important part of an advanced conditioning program, yet stopping to breathe in between reps is, by definition, no longer maintaining the highest output. If the goal is to move larger loads when conditioning, whether it be power or strength movements, then it’s obvious that strength needs to be increased. But that’s another article entirely.</p>
<p>As an aside:</p>
<p>For those of you that don’t condition (which is fine, I’m not saying you HAVE to), power movements are fantastic conditioning tools. They primarily consist of concentric muscle contraction (muscle length shortening) and leave out the soreness producing eccentric action (muscle length elongating – an example would be the hamstrings stretching at the bottom of a kettlebell swing). An example of using some power movements in a conditioning workout that aims to sustain maximum power for as long as possible would be doing lower rep, low weight power cleans with push-ups and box jumps for repeated rounds. This setup is incredibly simple, but if the trainee blows through five rounds without any rest (taking anywhere from four to seven minutes), then a significant stress is imparted.</p>

  <h2 id="christmas--presents">CHRISTMAS = PRESENTS</h2>
<p>The fire light dances off the wrapping paper as you are surrounded by a subtle glow from your family’s Christmas tree. The wrapped gift in your lap says, “To: You, From: Santa”. The welling of excitement is nearly pouring out of your body as your parents give you the okay to open your gift. What could it be? Surely it is something wonderful and fun. Your hands tear the paper away to reveal not only your first Christmas gift, but jubilation.</p>
<p>This scenario is similar to most childhood Christmas experiences. Traditions are kept alive and passed to children, and each family has their own way of celebrating Christmas. Some people don’t celebrate Christmas – they either have conflicting religious beliefs or lost interest over the years – but these people are the American minority. Most celebrate Christmas for religious reasons, specifically the symbolic birth of Christ. This symbolic birth is often cited as the “true meaning of Christmas”, but deep down nobody actually believes that. Christmas is all about presents.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking. Presents are a materialistic and you were always taught that there is more to Christmas than just opening presents. WRONG! Christmas = presents.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas is about getting presents.</strong> The anticipation of presents is sometimes better than the gift itself. Most presents are thoughtful, helpful, or amusing, yet unwrapping gifts fills us with a childlike sensation that only occurs next to that colorful tree.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas is about giving presents.</strong> The reciprocal of getting is giving, and once you mature you realize how much joy you get out of giving gifts. It can be hard figuring out what the perfect gift is, but in reality it doesn’t matter; you did something thoughtful for someone you cared about, and that’s all that matters.</p>
<p>Giving and receiving presents creates a fun, exciting atmosphere that resonates outside of the living room. Folks at work are relaxed, people at the store are nice, and there is a growing level of anxiousness that looks forward to Christmas day. This brings me to the most important point:</p>
<p><strong>The greatest Christmas present is your family.</strong> Family is relative; it can mean your parents and siblings, your friends, or anyone else that you genuinely care about. The gift of spending quality time with your family is a present that is insurmountable. This may be the only time of year you get to see your family, and it’s the holiday season that allows this to happen. The sights and sounds of Christmas are all a pleasant prelude to the true meaning of Christmas: presents.</p>
<p>Nobody thinks about religious meaning or pagan traditions as they rip away wrapping paper; instead they are enjoying the emotions and nostalgia of sharing not only gifts, but each other’s presence. I hope you and your family create beautiful memories this holiday season while holding past Christmas memories close to your heart.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas. And shit.</p>

  <p><strong>What is mobility?</strong></p>
<p>Injuries, tweaks, muscle pulls, and slight irritations are a part of a strength and conditioning program. Knowing how to deal with them is beneficial, but doing all you can to prevent them — known as “prehab” — is more important. Of the three components of fitness — strength, mobility, and endurance — I lump prehab into the mobility portion. Mobility is the ability to change directions, maneuver through an environment, and react to changing demands accordingly. Relevant metrics to mobility are flexibility (ROM), balance, coordination, and agility. Range of motion concerns are most relevant to prehab, and it’s what will be the focus here.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you want to call it — flexibility, limberness, range of motion — improving these qualities will improve mobility, and that’s why they are often summed up as “mobility training”. The most notable contributor to this area of training is Dr. Kelly Starrett (KStar). KStar posts a video every day on his <a href="http://mobilitywod.blogspot.com/">Mobility WOD</a> that will improve flexibility, joint positioning, or postural positioning so that when you train, you aren’t exacerbating any existing problems.</p>
<p>This basically aims to improve the pliability of soft tissue to allow for proper positioning. Mike Hom likes to think of it as a buffer between being able to do things that will or will not injure you (he’s also going to write up a post to share more info). Having this improved “mobility” helps you do the things that you want and need to do as well as protect you against potential injurous trauma.</p>
<p><strong>What Lifters Need To Do</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have a basic understanding of the prehab version of mobility, I want to briefly explain what lifters need to focus on with some examples. If you are lifting hard on a regular basis, specifically if you are gaining lots of strength on a novice progression and are gaining lots of weight, you will probably run into some soft tissue problems. <strong>The problem areas include musculature in the entire hip region and the sacral/lumbar region.</strong> It makes sense as to why; the external rotators of the hip are always contracting to shove the knees out in squatting, cleaning, snatching, and deadlifting while the lower back is always contracting to maintain proper extension. These structures need to stay pliable, and they can’t if they don’t ever get stretched amongst all the contracting.</p>
<p>Here are some basic stretches that I think are necessary for lifters who are training hard. Note that you don’t need any special equipment to do these (foam roller, lacrosse balls, bands, etc.), yet those tools are necessary to do the more advanced stuff.</p>
<p>Kelly Starrett has already posted videos with the stretches, so here they are.</p>
<p><strong>Low Back</strong></p>
<p>At :40s Kelly talks about how the reverse hyper is an excellent tool. Then around 1:00 he shows a lumbar spinal decompression stretch. You can do the same thing by hanging from a bar, but you have to let your hips sink down by not contracting with your abdominals. There’s also another method at :50s of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bjq8preeSjI&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">this video</a>.</p>
<p><strong>External Rotators of the Hips</strong></p>
<p>This is a standard stretch that appears often throughout KStar’s videos. You can do it on the floor with the same principles (there’s a video for the floor version, but I couldn’t find it after searching for 2 seconds), but in this video they do it on a box. Stretch starts at :47ish, but the intro is still good.</p>
<p><strong>Hip flexor</strong></p>
<p>This is a standard stretch that is an important lesson for most people. The largest hip flexor is the rectus femoris, and it’s also one of the quadriceps. So it flexes the hip and extends the knee. In order to stretch this long muscle, you’ll have to do the opposite at each joints (the hip and knee are proximal and distal attachments respectively); extend the hip and flex the knee. Kelly shows you how in this video. The stretch starts at 2:17ish, but I recommend watching the beginning. You’ll see why.</p>
<p>There you have it: three basic stretches that are very easy to do without equipment or a partner. These could even be preparatory stretches that you do before lifting to get loosened up. I used to do a method of all three with some light foam rolling to help get loosened up, but I think most of you could use them on a daily basis. I KNOW you guys aren’t doing any mobility work, so start with these simple exercises.</p>

  <p>Short post today. This is a video of Zach Krych, and 85kg Olympic weightlifter. This video details an incredible story where he suffered a devastating injury to his wrists. It shows his recovery and rehab process in chronological order. Zach not only recovers from his injury, but he also performs at the highest level by winning the US Senior Nationals and closes in on Kendrick Farris’ (the top American 85kg lifter) total. This is one of the most impressive videos I’ve ever seen, and this is one of the biggest comebacks in any sport. Congrats to Zach and good luck.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of the 70’s Big Facebook fan page, then you already saw the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCROpchUjQI">Meatball Deathstar</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/EpicMealTime">Epic Meal Time</a> (that’s smart). This next video isn’t their most violent or intense, but it’s fucking impressive. It’s the Slaughterhouse Christmas Special:</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>The chat room was last night (every Tuesday evening) and was interesting. There weren’t as many questions as week 1, and the topics got kinda weird at times (I blame this on AC). Anyway, we’ll do the next one next Tuesday.</p>
