  <p>Remember when we did <a href="/blog/2014/09/chalk-talk-7/" target="_blank">soft tissue work on the QL</a> to relieve tension on the pelvis and sacrum? Well, now we’re going to do an incredibly useful and necessary exercise to strengthen the quadratus lumborum, and it’s a one arm farmer’s walk. This is a must-do exercise for all populations as it can significantly improve back health and prevent injury.</p>
<p>Regular farmer’s walks are a simple two-handed carry exercise to work on grip strength and loading the entire body. The one arm variation will function differently. Whereas regular farmer’s are to be done heavy, the one arm sort should be light to moderate. The goal isn’t to move the most weight, the goal is to maintain a stable, neutral trunk position (with the chest up and lower abs contracted) without slouching the shoulders. Putting an emphasis on not leaning over in the trunk or hips forces the QL to maintain leverage of the trunk, hence our reason for executing this exercise.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unqraM9sSvk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The first time I did this exercise, I just used a 24kg kettlebell (~53 pounds) and could not only feel my QL during the movement, but had a healthy soreness the next day or two. Strengthening the QL along with regular soft tissue work will likely reduce tweaks or strains and improve how your lower back, pelvis, and S/I area feel.</p>
<p>Throw these in at the end of your training session every week, but don’t do them if you’re gonna go heavy in the next session. You don’t want your stabilizing muscles to be sore or fatigued when trying to lift heavy. They would work well in the last session of the week with adequate rest after until you are accustomed to them. Remember, weight isn’t the key; good trunk position and QL activation is.</p>

  <p>A friend asked me what my thoughts are on “Reverse Dieting”, a method of manipulating metabolism to decrease body fat or weight. Is it something lifters should use? Is it healthy? What is the effect on performance?</p>
<p><strong>Reverse Dieting Review</strong></p>
<p>There’s a concept in “dieting” where knowing the total calories consumed and burned in a day will have a net loss or gain in weight. The standard recommendation is to drop 500 calories off of the daily intake, and since 3500 calories equals one pound, you’ll have a net decrease of one pound per week.</p>
<p>Except the body has millions of years of evolution that result in not wanting to wither and starve, so it makes it difficult to lose weight and body fat. Eventually metabolism is lowered in order to accommodate the lack of calories, and weight loss will stagnate.</p>
<p>Reverse Dieting adds a low percentage — around 5% per week — of calories back into the daily diet in order to raise the metabolism. A bunch of good things happen, and the person generally feels better, yet they still have a decrease in weight or fat because they’re overall caloric intake is still below their “pre-dieting level”.</p>

<p>Of course they are going to feel better when they add some calories; they were fucking starving! Look, I’m probably the wrong guy to ask about this. For one or two years my recommendation was pounding as much food as possible and drinking a gallon of milk a day. Kidding aside, here’s a full disclaimer, I wrote and sell a nutrition book — <a href="/books/pale-for-lifters/" target="_blank">Paleo for Lifters</a> — and don’t really like conventional nutrition wisdom, even the natural bodybuilding kind that is successful. And here’s why.</p>
<p>First, the concept of “dieting” bothers me. The word “diet” is a derivative of a Greek word that means “way of life”, implying that a “diet” is what you do all of the time, not just when you’re trying to lose weight or fat. My nutrition philosophy revolves around a base structure that can be tweaked towards a goal. We can call this base “the Paleo diet”, or we can say “not eating processed and inflammatory foods”…whatever. If food quality is consistently sound, then it solves a lot of weight and body fat issues without even getting specific. I’m not a weirdo who thinks the entire lifestyle needs to be predicated on Paleolithic populations, but remember what century you’re in; there’s a lot of horrible, shitty food out there, and the more you cut out all the chemical bullshit, the better.</p>
<p>Second, Reverse Dieting is based on a conventional idea that cutting calories solves the problem. Sure, diet is an important part of health and fat/weight loss, but it’s exponentially more effective with purposeful training. Another tenet of my nutrition philosophy is the training associated with it, and that’s strength training with barbells and high intensity conditioning. The hormonal effect from <em>training</em>, not “working out”, is so important, it can even overrule a shitty diet (yeah, I’m talking to you Dr. Kilgore!). Let’s assume someone is doing a decent job of exercising while Reverse Dieting, which leads me to the next point…</p>
<p>Third, there’s a hormonal effect from food. Dr. Barry Sears said it best with, “Food is a drug.” I understand the concept of not “violating the rules of thermodynamics” blah-fuckity-blah (such a pretentious thing to say about nutrition), but there are direct, secondary, and tertiary effects from the things you put in your mouth (more on that in “<a href="/blog/2014/10/on-drugs-and-supplements/" target="_blank">On Drugs and Supplements</a>“). Calories obviously matter, but to ignore the fact that sugary corn syrup and a sweet potato have a very different effect means you a) don’t know how it’s different or b) don’t really give a shit. This isn’t the place to get into it, but food is a drug and will have an effect on hormone function, and <em>not</em> just insulin and its sensitivity. Merely cutting calories is a temporary solution, because if someone is fat, they need an entire paradigm shift of how to consume food, not merely having less of it.</p>
<p>Third, Reverse Dieting is one of those “counting calories” things. And aside from it being a giant pain in the ass, it makes people weird. More often than people want to admit, it makes them have a complex about their food, bodies, and self-esteem. Any coach or trainer who thinks they haven’t had a client with one of these issues must have got their certification for a few hundred bucks this past weekend. Even in my world — the one where people want to kick doors down, run fast, and throw some god damn iron around — there are people who get lost worrying about this stuff. I think everyone should be able to look at a few ounces of meat and know how much protein is in there and look at some fruit and know how many carbs they are about to eat, but counting calories and macros should be reserved for those really hard pushes for competition or losing body fat…_after _learning and implementing food quality.</p>
<p>Fourth, calorie cutting and Reverse Dieting isn’t good for performance. Again, I prefer to work with guys who want hairy chests and jacked backs, and women who want to squat more than most “men”, so “cutting calories” is the equivalent of a POW scenario. Most of these gimmicky diets are used by folks who only, or primarily, care about aesthetics. We train to get better at something, and the aesthetics are a byproduct of training. Instead, restructure how you eat, train intelligently, and then — and only then — jump into the weeds looking for tiny-ass insects like “macros” and “total calories”.</p>
<p>No, I don’t think Reverse Dieting is a good idea. I may not have explained it accurately, but I don’t think I care. I’m all about cleaning up food quality, eating protein to maintain or build lean body mass, eating carbs to match activity level, and eating fat to recover from elbow dropping training sessions. When people complain about Paleo being low-carb, they’re just stupid…just eat more carbs! This shit isn’t hard to explain, it’s just hard to do because it has to be done consistently.</p>
<p>I’m not into gimmick diets like Reverse Dieting, I’m into the “way of life” thing. Base your nutrition on real food — it was slaughtered or gardened within a couple days — without inflammatory effects, train smart, sleep more, and reap the reward. It’s easy to adjust, and there aren’t too many fat people who do it this way.</p>

<p>Foles was asked that question on the Mike and Mike radio show on Wednesday morning, and I thought it was interesting.</p>
<p>What is the most important thing you’ve learned about training?</p>

  <p>I almost died.</p>
<p>I was in the bathroom of the football field house as a freshman in college. The offensive coordinator, a 6’5 290+ former offensive lineman, occupied one of the toilets in the cramped bathroom. The man lived on cheap coffee and cigarettes. And greasy food. And ash trays, garbage, and misery. I knew he lived on these things because I could distinguish all of them in the pungent, putrid odor from the horrible deuce he was dropping when I walked in to take a piss. I barely escaped without vomiting, much less my life.</p>
<p>Now that I think about that day ten years ago, I realize how horribly unhealthy that coach was. It makes me think about people who poison their bodies in the hopes of comforting themselves, feeling better, or even performing better. Let’s get a handle on what we’re doing to our bodies before we turn into a biohazard spill in a public bathroom.</p>
<p>Let’s break a healthy life down into practical components. There’s <strong>physical health</strong>, or the physiologic function of the body. There’s <strong>mental health</strong>, which more so concerns things like self-esteem, productivity, and education. Lastly, there’s **emotional health **which can encompass social health, spiritual stuff, and stress. I’m generalizing, but these are basic aspects of health. This website usually tries to maximize these areas in order to increase performance. For example, managing life stress effects sleep quality which plays a major role in training recovery. Time management will determine how much time we get to spend training in a week. These various aspects of health not only constantly interact with one another, but they are affected by things we consume.</p>

<p>I really like how The Zone Diet’s Barry Sears put an emphasis on saying, “<strong>Food is a drug</strong>,” in his original book. He was explaining the hormonal response of food choices and its effect on health. But we need to remember that everything else you consume is a drug too, and drugs have intended results as well as secondary unintended results called side effects. Learning what substances do to our body is important for health. let’s look at what other substances we consume.</p>
<p>Other than food, there are:</p>
<p><strong>Supplements</strong> – Things we consume in order to augment health or performance</p>
<p><strong>Performance enhancement drugs</strong> – Things that have a more overt role in increasing performance and are usually illegal in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Illegal Drugs</strong> – Things like marijuana or hard drugs that have a desired effect (and are usually illegal).</p>
<p><strong>Vice Drugs</strong> – Legal things like caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, dipping tobacco that we indulge in for their effect. Some are worse than others.</p>
<p><strong>Prescription Drugs</strong> – Things that are prescribed by a doctor to improve physical, mental, or emotional health, but always have undesirable side effects.</p>
<p>I don’t intend to insult your intelligence by naming these things, but it’s a growing list of things we put in our bodies that are going to dictate an aspect of health. For example, some of the above items are abused and have a significant negative impact on people’s lives, ranging from simple behavioral issues to suicide.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to jump into “worst case scenario scare tactics” to convince you to be healthy, but there’s a broad range of responses from drugs. There are different ways to improve physical, mental, and emotional health, but misusing or abusing any of the above substances will likely have a negative effect.</p>
<p>Let’s bring the Serious Factor down a little bit with a real world example. The Law Dragon was drinking lots of coffee and progressed up to 8 to 10 cups of cheap coffee a day. His energy level would fluctuate so he’d drink more coffee or give into sugar cravings. He would only sleep 4-6 hours a night and feel groggy upon waking. He’d start shutting down around 3pm, and when he left work at 6 to 8pm, he’d feel and look terrible; dark circles under the eyes, dehydrated despite drinking water, and his skin was pale and literally painful. His bowel movements were loose. Not to mention an overall trouble concentrating that led to more coffee…</p>
<p>A few weeks ago he decided to do the “grassfed butter in a higher quality coffee” once a day. The results were drastic. Energy levels stay up, no sweet cravings, getting 7-8 hours of quality sleep, refreshed in the morning, not shutting down, and skin and complexion have significantly improved. Bowels are normal, but overall there’s heightened concentration and temperament throughout the day.</p>
<p>Some of his results are directly from reducing the bad caffeine while others are probably results of results, but the fact is he got sucked into a common downward spiral with a beverage most of us drink every day.</p>
<p>And this brings me to my philosophy on drugs of all kind: <strong>start with none</strong>. Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>How many of you played sports? What did you always do in the first 15 minutes of each practice? Without fail, you probably worked on a fundamental aspect of your sport. It’s because you can never work on the fundamentals too much; they are the foundation upon which everything is built. Forgetting the fundamentals often leads to break down and defeat.</p>

    Focusing on the fundamentals leads to total health.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Physical health is predicated on the fundamentals: good food quality, hydration, and sleep. Until these basic health skills are covered, it isn’t even worth looking at adding anything else. That goes for building a supplement stack or just energy boosters like coffee.</p>
<p>Things like good communication, positive thinking, and a high self esteem may be fundamentals for mental and emotional health, but some times we consume food or drugs to make us feel a certain way. Substances and drugs should never be consumed to change our mood or behavior; they should only be consumed to augment them. In other words, you shouldn’t smoke weed to relax, drink alcohol to feel better, or take a prescription amphetamine to focus. If you indulge in these substances — and I don’t really care if you do — it should be for an effect on your already positive health while still being aware of the side effects. Responsible, healthy adults are capable of indulging in things like marijuana or alcohol without a negative impact, but I’m suggesting they should only indulge when their physical, mental, and emotional health is sound.</p>
<p>Personally I’ve never used any substances other than caffeine and alcohol — no illegal or performance enhancement drugs — but I’ve seen the negative consequences of all of the drugs I listed above. By ensuring your health fundamentals are sound, you can avoid all of the worst case scenarios as well as the side effects that otherwise negate physical, mental, or emotional health. If you can smoke weed without being a lazy piece of shit, or do steroids without throwing off your hormone profile, then that’s your prerogative. But if your health fundamentals are sound, you won’t really need those things.</p>
<p>Partake in the various drugs because you <em>want</em> to augment how you feel or function, not because you <em>need</em> to. You don’t need to supplement testosterone to build muscle or lose body fat. You don’t need amphetamines to study for your exam. What you need is to focus on the fundamentals. I’m not asking you to do a silly douche juice cleanse, but stop and look at what you’re putting into your body every day. Moderate that shit, eat more protein, clean your carbs up, drink more water, go to bed earlier, and do a relaxation drill five minutes each day. That’s all the cleansing you’ll need because the fundamentals trump drugs every time.</p>

  <p>Someone saw the video below and wanted to know the recipe for this trail mix my wife made. The rest of this post is written by Alycia.</p>
<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/r0M4GVxKb5/embed/" width="392" height="454" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<p>The original nut recipe that won Justin over was given to me by my stepmother. It’s delicious. Aaaaand packed with butter and sugar. Once Justin realized it was delicious because of all the sugar I experimented with a few other variations…alas, this one was the best. So if you’re concerned with the carb content eat sparingly – if you possess that kind of willpower – and give the rest to your less healthy friends and family. The measurements are somewhat approximate because they vary depending on how sweet you want your mix to be.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Justin’s Cereal</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>2lb bag pecan halves</p>
<p>1-2c brown sugar</p>
<p>2 tbsp vanilla extract</p>
<p>zest from 1 medium orange and juice from half</p>
<p>1-2 stick(s) salted butter</p>
<p>2c dried cranberries</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Preheat oven to 300*</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Crush pecan halves into pieces</p>
<p>Pro-tip: While it may seem more efficient to pulverize the pecans using a wine bottle do not be fooled; this will only leave you with pecan dust and pecan dust does not make for good “cereal.”</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Spread crushed nuts out on a baking sheet. It’s better to have a single layer – so you will likely need two sheets.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Cut butter into chunks and crumble over deez nuts.</p>
<p>Note: The butter allows the sugar to “candy” the nuts giving them that yummy crunch, so make sure there’s enough to go around.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Pour vanilla extract, brown sugar, orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla over nuts</p>
<p>Note: I’ve gone more conservative with the sugar before and it just wasn’t the same. If you’re making this mix accept that it’s not going to be the most “healthy” and do it right. Otherwise you might as well enjoy a bag of plain nuts…and no one likes plain nuts.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Mix to coat then re-distribute over baking sheets</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Bake for 8-10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Take baking sheets out, mix and redistribute nuts, then place back in the oven until the butter starts to bubble. This part is crucial because it’s when the nuts become crunchy – it could take 20 minutes or more, so be patient. Don’t let the nuts burn!</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Allow mix to cool and enjoy “cereal” with almond milk.</p>

  <p>Two years ago I wrote a post about <a href="/blog/2012/07/transitioning-to-olympic-weightlifting/" target="_blank">Transitioning Into Olympic Weightlifting</a>. If you have considered making the switch, it’s worth a read. <a href="https://twitter.com/conorjmcclure/status/514557187616931840" target="_blank">@conorjmcclure asked</a> how the program could be turned into a 3x/week program instead of the regular 4x/wk.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use the original template: 1) as a transition into weightlifting to allow joints and soft tissue to adapt to the explosive movements or 2) as a combination of explosive weightlifting movements with traditional strength movements. How I’d approach a 3x/wk would depend on the trainee’s intention, but usually people still want to get stronger while incorporating the Olympic lifts. Here’s how I’d do it:</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<p>Snatch (heavy)</p>
<p>Clean and Jerk (medium)</p>
<p>Squat</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Press or Push-press</p>
<p>Front Squat</p>
<p>Barbell rows</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>Snatch (medium)</p>
<p>Clean and Jerk (heavy)</p>
<p>Squat or Bench</p>
<p>RDL</p>
<p>It’s not a perfect template, but I like the symmetry of snatching and CJ’ing on the first and third training days instead of bunching them on one side of the week. If the lifter was young (and therefore can recover well) or an intermediate squatter wanting to push it hard, they could squat on Friday. This weekly structure would work well with a traditional Texas Method set up, and depending on the lifter’s deficiency, they could focus more on the Olympic lifts or the squatting. Otherwise, I’d clean and jerk heavier near the end of the week, use that as some squatting work, and then get some benching in if the person was weak or still wanted to get bigger. I don’t usually knock bench completely out of a program unless someone is no-shit committed to weightlifting.</p>
<p>I always like to get quality <a href="/blog/2011/06/the-rdl/" target="_blank">RDLs </a>in most programs since most trainees rarely develop their posterior chain properly and they can be a benefit in weightlifting. If someone wanted to, they could squat _and _bench _and _RDL, but that’s kind of a lot of shit going on. The benching could always be lighter or medium-ish and supersetted with RDLs for the sake of getting through it.</p>
<p>As far as the snatch and CJ, I’d approach it like I mentioned in the previous article. To summarize, you’d lift heavy in one of the lifts and then “medium” (or about 80% of the hypothetical max) with the other lift. Snatch is always done first since you’ll always CJ after a snatch in a meet. Monday would be heavy snatch, medium CJ. Friday would be medium snatch, heavy CJ. For the medium lift, accumulate 6 to 10 reps preferably on a clock (1 minute for snatch, 90 to 120 seconds for CJ). For the heavy lift, work up to heavy singles, meaning you can only do about five of them. Each week you’ll aim to increase the weight by 2.5 or 5k. When you can’t maintain 5 singles, just do about 3 and keep progressing. Eventually you’ll only be able to hit one heavy single and can’t repeat it. Keep pushing the weight each week with as small increments as you can. If you did this progression right, you should have about 2 or 3 months of work. If you have serious mechanical errors, then decrease the top load about 10% and work on your issue.</p>
<p><span style="color: #373737;">This is pretty much a beginner progression on the Olympic lifts that can last anywhere from two to four months. It’s simple and effective. Once you peter out on this progression, you’ll be ready for more complicated programming unless you just want to continue doing sub-maximal work on the Olympic lifts and max them every few weeks.</span></p>
<p>Ideally you’d want a coach before starting so you don’t ingrain bad habits or movement patterns, but once you complete this progression you definitely need to seek out a coach. If you spend a couple months working on something, it means you’re dedicated enough to spend a little money and improve on whatever you accomplished solo.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t add much more to this other than pull-ups or chin-ups sprinkled in on any day. Of course, muscle imbalances should be corrected when necessary, but most people throw too much shit into a training program, clutter it up, and they miss out on raw performance gain that the basic barbell lifts provide.</p>
