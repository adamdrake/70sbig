  <h2 id="pr-friday">PR Friday</h2>
<p>State your PR’s or update us on your training. Feel free to ask questions, I’ll check them throughout today. Also if there are specific topics you’d like to hear about, I can do my best to write about them.</p>
<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
<p>The first video shows Chris squatting 500×10 — YEAH BUUUUUUDYYYYYYYY! Brent has already chastised Mike for his camera work, so I won’t do it here. He moves behind Chris towards the end of the set to spot him.</p>
<p>The second video is Mike squatting 430×10 in time period where he’s cutting weight for a PT test. Chris doesn’t say much; he must be tired from his set. Good lifting, fellas.</p>
<p>Do you have a video of you hitting some PR’s in a good training environment? Send them to <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">Justin@70sbig.com</a>.</p>
<p><em>Edit: There may be some additions to this post throughout the day. You can also see more at the 70’s Big Facebook page.</em></p>

  <p>**“Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths.</p>
<p>When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.”</p>
<p>– Arnold Schwarzenegger**</p>
<p>Arnold is someone that I look to. I’ve read his autobiography and encyclopedia of bodybuilding while appreciating his physique and movies. The thing that I am most impressed with is his will to strive for success. Throughout his life he committed himself fully to whatever goal he had in mind, and he always achieved that goal and excelled. Not many people know that he was a <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/956561/arnold_schwarzenegger_man_of_success.html">millionaire</a> before he even got into acting; he started a prosperous brick-laying business. This was after his acclaimed success in bodybuilding, winning the Mr. Olympia seven times. Then he had a successful acting career followed by his career in politics that included the governorship in California. Arnold is a doer, a producer, and this makes him a hero. I highly recommend reading his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671797484/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0822522233&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0P715YS2J8X02E1JRHC9">autobiography</a> to learn how he bred the mindset of success as he got into bodybuilding. He is one of the most impressive men in modern history.</p>
<p>Not many people know that Arnold dabbled in some powerlifting and strongman when he was active in bodybuilding. It’s documented that Franco Columbo, Arnold’s close friend when he trained for the Olympia in the U.S., was an impressive deadlifter, but Arnold put up some solid weight himself. Observe.</p>

<p>The first picture shows that he had a puny squat at the time (if it was a true 1RM), but he was 19. He also never really had huge legs, and it probably helped his tapered appearance. A 616 deadlift at 19 is still awesome.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-a-workout">Lessons From A Workout</h2>
<p>My friend Shawn has always been an interesting guy. He never really played sports and got into lifting weights when we were in college. Admittedly un-athletic, he makes it very clear to me that he just wants “to look great”. I don’t blame him; being in law school is competition enough. Regardless of his end goal, his program outline includes squatting, pressing, and deadlifting. We worked out together this past weekend, and there were several lessons that came out of it.</p>
<p>Shawn’s a pretty big guy at 6’2 227ish and is now far from being “by far the weirdest boy I have ever met” (which my Mom said after meeting him for the first time). His idol is Arnold Schwarzenegger and he wants to get up to 245. Sure, he wants to be strong, but “looking great” is still the comedic mantra. I don’t see anything wrong with goals like this and this post is even directed at such an individual; it will explain some of the fallacies that a lot of people commit and make suggestions on how they can improve their programming outline.</p>
<p>I had been telling him all week we were “gonna catch a pump”. He was excited.</p>
<p>We started out with deadlifts; something that Shawn sort of neglects. He does them, but every other week. This is…</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #1</strong></p>
<p>Whether your goal is a muscular physique or impressive strength, and you’re still in the early stages of achieving either, you should deadlift once a week. A novice, as defined in the book <em>Practical Programming</em> is going to adapt to a single medium-to-heavy work set within a week’s time, and thus it can be done every week. For mass gaining purposes, this will illicit a systemic and hormonal response that is conducive for growth. It will make all of the “bodybuilding exercises” more effective.</p>
<p>I corrected a couple nuances in Shawn’s form (primarily pushing through his toes and letting the bar swing forward) as he worked up to 315. This is usually where he caps himself at this weight, which is…</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #2</strong></p>
<p>You can’t get stronger without progressive overload, and getting stronger will help someone wanting to build muscle. We’ll see why later.</p>
<p>I bumped him up to 335, and he did another triple. He went a little forward on the second rep, but cuing him to keep the bar “back” made a solid third rep. On the third rep his hamstrings stuttered at the lockout, a “tut-tut-tut”. You see this when people are new to deadlifting, or deadlifting heavy, so my as well make it…</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #3</strong></p>
<p>Their hamstrings aren’t used to being under the tension forces, and there are proprioceptive sensory receptors that say, “Hey, we’re not used to this, we could get hurt and stuff, so turn that muscle off”. What results is a fast on-off light switch flicking that makes it stutter. Deadlifting while fatigued will do the same thing, and it is usually something that eases away when the trainee gets more experienced with deadlifting. They won’t be so herky jerky because the related muscles get more efficient and coordinated.</p>
<p>Then we went on to press (the standing barbell press if you’re keeping track at home). Shawn warmed up and had 135 on the bar (I think it was his cap on this lift). I asked him how many he was going to do, and he said 8 or 10. I suggested that he start getting some heavier pressing in, then he can back off for drop sets to build muscle (I’ll explain this in a second). He agreed, and greedily threw on a 10 to make it 155. I don’t know what Shawn’s max is, but imagine adding 20 pounds to something that was at or above 85% of your max on press; it isn’t going to go well. His triple turned into a double.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #4</strong></p>
<p>Warm-up properly and don’t get greedy. If you’re doing heavier lifting, then you won’t start tossing iron onto the bar like a drunk cowboy. You’ll need to ease into it. Unless you’ve been there before, it’s always better to ease into higher weights.</p>
<p>We backed off to 140×3. Then did 145×3. Then 150×3 for two sets. The two sets went pretty well and were much better than the missed 155 (I gave Shawn the option to move to 155 again on the last triple, but I warned him that since he wasn’t used to the lifting that he may poop out. He opted to stay at 150 which was a safe decision. In retrospect he could have gotten 155, but that’s why you take it slow; next time he’ll know that he can make the jump). Now it was time for the fun part.</p>
<p>Shawn occasionally will bump over to dumbbell presses for the next part of his workout, but we stayed with the bar for simplicity and brevity. What I had him implement was a basic rest-pause technique. The best way to stress the muscle to grow is deplete substrates from the cells so that it has to increase in cell size to accommodate the stress. Literature shows an optimal rep range (8 to 12ish reps), yet it also points out that minimal rest time is just as important. And it makes sense; when you do several sets with little rest in the indicated rep range, you’re using the muscle when it is in a fatigued state. Safe stress while fatigued forces the cells to get bigger as an adaptation. Hence my choice of the following rest-pause technique that I made up (but isn’t novel by any means):</p>
<p>Back off to something you could get for 8 to 10 reps. Do a set in that rep range, but don’t completely burn out off the get go.</p>
<p>Rest 30 seconds, and do the second set. Aim for the same reps.</p>
<p>Rest another 30 seconds, and do the third set getting as many reps as possible (at this point, it should be less than the other sets).</p>
<p>Bodybuilding magazines would say this lets you get in more work in a shorter amount of time. True. You can get about 24 reps in while A) getting a desired rep range, B) with little rest, and C) in a short amount of time. Shawn went 115×10, barely 115×10 on the second set, and then 95×7 (a complete burnout set). My point to make is…</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #5</strong></p>
<p>Being stronger will let you handle more weight for this. If you multiply the weight and the reps, Shawn’s rest-pause sets calculate to a tonnage of 2965 lbs. If he could have done it with 135×10 on each set, that would be 4050. If he could have done it with 155×10, that would be 4650 lbs. If he could do it with 185×10, that would be 5550 lbs. Just from a tonnage perspective, you can see how much more work the muscles will have to perform in the same amount of time to create an adaptive stress. The stronger you get, the more weight you can handle for silly shit like rest-pause and the more JACKED you can get. You think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PrXyp4Zz0g&amp;feature=player_embedded">365×30 box squats</a> are done by someone only squatting 400? Pffffffffft, the power of jorts.</p>
<p>Getting stronger will let you use more weight in drop sets or ridiculous stuff.</p>
<p>Shawn was depleted after this rest-pause thing; he clearly wasn’t used to the work load (capping yourself at a given weight will do that). Anyway, next we did a lot of pull-ups. I went ahead and threw them in a little rotation of pull-ups, sit-ups, and push-ups. Dips could have been thrown in too, but I forgot about them. This can act as a very mild conditioning stress. If you aren’t conditioning at all, it’ll make you breathe hard and sweat giving you a little bit of a stress without going over board or interfering with recovery. It will also give you some stress at body-weight only movements, which may or may not be beneficial (it could potentially help with the horizontal rambas, but this is what we call a digression). In any case, we made it to the end of the workout where, as I informed Shawn, we were going to “catch a pump”.</p>
<p>Me: Down the rack and down the stack, my brethren.</p>
<p>Shawn: I don’t even know what that means.</p>
<p>Basically it starts with alternating dumbbell curls down the stack. Now, I never specifically train my arms. In fact, I hated doing so when Shawn and I were more into the bodybuilding mindset. My arms are so short that they will be big just from chins, presses, benches, and deadlifts (yes, deadlifts; the triceps extend the shoulder during the pull). The week before I started playing around with doing curls in the rest-pause method I described above. Lots of reps for sets with little rest. In this case, there is less muscle, so I gave it less rest.</p>
<p>Me: Start at the 60s and work your way down.</p>
<p>Shawn: 60s!? Dude, I don’t ever really go above 45s…</p>
<p>You may scoff at the 45s or the fact that Shawn caps his weight, but he has bigger arms than you and admits he “looks great”. I used 55s the week before for six on each arm, so I figured 60 would be ez pz. Maybe I used 50s instead, because I only got 3 reps in my demonstration. In any case, I worked down the rack, getting up to six reps per each arm and maintaining that all the way down. I noticed immediately that I can easily curl much more than I could a few years ago when I was doing it every week, and I attribute that to my trunk being stronger. A stronger trunk helps you stabilize the body as you curl one arm at a time.</p>
<p>You can see that running down the rack would have a similar rest-pause effect. Honestly, don’t think too much about curls or triceps press downs (which came next). They are just fucking arm exercises. Have fun with it. I’m of the opinion that using a high rep multi-set approach with little rest is going to be a perfect compliment to the strength building you’ve been doing. Going down the rack or stack is just amusing, especially when you commentate throughout the sat as I do.</p>
<p>Me: Oh, this was harder than I thought. All right, come on, you can get it! Can he do it folks? Can he get six reps? He’s at four! Five! Six — he’s done it folks, he got it. Now he’s on to the 45s. Can he get six?</p>
<p>It helps if you bare your teeth and push your eyebrows up into a point with a really crazy look in your eye. Trust me.</p>
<p>We then went down the stack, starting at 115 on the pulley machine and going down each plate (I want to point out that Shawn couldn’t do six reps; I owned him on his home field and in his own exercise). I’m confidently telling you that I caught a CONTAGIOUS pump. Swollertrophy was imminent. It could have just been my short arms, but I literally couldn’t reach my back. I barely scratched my head. It was hard to shower with that swollertrophy running rampant through my veins.</p>
<p>So there you have it, several lessons from training with Shawn. Sure, Shawn may not have been working out as hard as he could be and could be a monster if we trained together regularly, but it’s important to identify what you’re doing wrong so that you can improve upon it. Other ways you can implement this “drop rest-pause” thing would be with traditional bodybuilding exercises, especially with dumbbells. Go heavy on bench and then drop weight with DB flat bench. Or DB incline. Finish off the heavy press workout with sitting DB press. Back off and do a light set of 15 or 20 on deadlift. Back off of heavy squats and do front squat for reps (if you’re insane). Whatever you want to do, just don’t go overboard. I’d propose just adding one style of drop set per workout for a few weeks so that you can adapt to it. Then if you want to do DB chest flyes or whatever, go ahead, I don’t really care. The whole point is that you’ll effectively handle more weight in all of these things if you are <strong>STRONG</strong>. The more strength you can build early on, the more effective all of this goofy stuff will be. I also want to point out that the short rest is important — so many people dicking around in the gym will hit high rep sets, but they could get so much more adaptive stress by doing it with minimal rest. Those same people are weak, so it’s a moot point anyway, but now you know better.</p>

  <p>The Novembeardly challenge is still going on. Get all your beard/burly pics in, and then we can vote/evaluate them and get a contest winner. Also, the results from the Thanksgiving weight gain festivities will be calculated.</p>
<p>I had a post all typed out for today, yet I determined it would be much better with video. In addition to that, I have a post coming about those of you that appreciate the benefits of strength, but may only be concerned with “looking great”. Here’s a preview:</p>
<p>“Hey man, I’m more of a Corvette; I’m made to look great in the garage instead of going out and performing on the road.”</p>
<p>–Shawn, to me after feeling the effects of our workout last Saturday</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more.</p>
<p>To ready you for the Novembeardly submissions, take a gander at this pic. WildCard1989 sent it to me, and I don’t know if it’s him or not. The subject of the e-mail was, “Is this manly enough for ya?”</p>

<p>I also can’t believe it’s real, because that mama bear in the background would be severing some heads.</p>

  <p>Football is a sport: fact. Here’s a beautiful video of Browns running back Peyton Hillis bulldozing the Panther’s Charles Godfrey before scoring his third rushing touchdown. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/1">SB Nation</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judging by his touchdown celebrations, he’s also a big fan of ’80s cage wrestling, all monster trucks besides Grave Digger (sellout), and the paleo diet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hillis is from Arkansas, so I’d tend to disagree with the paleo thing. He’s also definitely 70’s Big.</p>

<p>Also being a little shit (i.e. under 200 pounds) can only get you so far. Andre Johnson got pissed enough to <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2010/11/28/1840671/andre-johnson-fight-cortland-finnegan-ejected-video">punch Cortland Finnegan in the head</a>. If you don’t know the background, Cortland is one of the dirtiest players in the league and has been fined several times this year for his assholery (I guess he’s trying to make up for being named “Cortland”). Aggressive, good; dickhead, bad. I want to point out that Johnson is 220+, and thus won the round.</p>

<h2 id="the-origins-of-thanksgiving">The Origins of Thanksgiving</h2>
<p>Thanksgiving is an interesting holiday. It is a convoluted, weird interpretation of something that <a href="http://www.danielnpaul.com/TheRealThanksgiving.html">didn’t really happen</a> in American history. It’s clear what has actually happened, and I will recount the sequence of events here.</p>
<p>70’s Big is an idea that started in early 2009 and developed into a website by September of the same year. Currently the site easily averages over 3,000 visitors a day. Instead of being concerned with number of readers, 70’s Big is more concerned with establishing a paradigm. Burly men and strong women go forth and take on risks and difficult challenges with fervor in their hearts. They learn this ability through the grueling battles with steel, iron, and gravity. Guts and courage are built through toil; they don’t simply appear at birth.</p>
<p>Alas! Food becomes an important part of this journey of self realization. It is fuel for the body so that the mind can push through each lesson. A man requires a hearty bounty, not egg whites and squash. And thus Thanksgiving was born.</p>
<p>“Bah! Thanksgiving hath endured for centuries; how hath 70’s Big birthed the Great Giving of Thanks?” A valid question, yet the reality is that Thanksgiving has not always existed. There was a time in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">alternate universe</a> in which Thanksgiving did not exist while all other things remained constant. The idea of 70’s Big was infectious upon the world as it grew into a dominant way of thinking. Society no longer bitched about being offended and the fame of celebrities waned to that of my big toe. It was a wonderful society that lived through the ages. Several millenia from now, the governing body decided to honor the inception of its way of thinking. Their solution: travel back in time and establish a holiday in which eating a hearty, complete meal was emphasized and glorified. The governing body sent their agents back in time to manipulate such a holiday. In a vain attempt to cloak their true identity, the time travelers showed up in black pilgrim costumes while others showed up as bare skinned Indians. The ruse worked to perfection because the public ate it up, and the Thanksgiving Feast was born.</p>
<p>70’s Big has been preceded by decades of proper eating, a testament to proper planning by the Time Travelers to ensure that skinny people have experienced good eating habits before starting their quest to 70’s Big. “Hard gainers” no longer have shitty excuses as to why they can’t gain weight, because they have done it correctly on at least one day of every year of their lives! <strong>Manliness is a choice</strong>, and Thanksgiving is as good a place as any to start.</p>
<p><strong>The Thanksgiving Eating Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have the origin of Thanksgiving out of the way, we can focus on the readers who have chosen Manliness over helplessness; Boldness over cowardliness; and strong over weak. I challenge all of you to an eating contest. We can’t really argue over subjective interpretations of how much you “actually ate”, so instead we’ll measure it by weight gained. You will need to weigh yourself before your feast, and then again after your feast (if you feast throughout the day, then weigh yourself at the end). You will also need to wear the same clothes throughout the day (i.e. wear the same stuff in your pre/post weighing). This would be a proper time to wear your 70’s Big shirt, since it’s our national holiday. Whoever gains the most weight will win a t-shirt. We are probably going to need video or picture evidence of your weigh-ins. This will cut back on cheating, even though it can still happen — don’t be a jackass. On Thanksgiving Day we’ll post our results to the comments.</p>
<p>Good luck to you all, and don’t forget to give thanks to the Time Travelers.</p>

  <p>When the 70s big gang went to USAPL Raw Nationals earlier this year, I met a girl there named Becca. She was a pretty lady lifting in the women’s session, and I was paying a lot of attention to her pretty much as soon as she entered my field of vision. I was paying so much attention to her that Justin had to remind me, “You realize you’re currently at a meet, right?” as he was pacing me through my squat warm ups.</br></p>
</br>
<p>Many of you won’t be surprised at my response – “Irrelevant, I can squat 200k in my sleep. First attempt will be ez pz.”</p>
</br>
<p></br>“It is a chore to be your friend,” Justin said.</p>
</br>
<p></br>Justin would use that line a lot throughout the weekend, like when he asked me how he could get my adrenaline going before my third attempt lifts:</p>
</br>
<p></br>“Just tell me I’ll never see her again.”</p>
</br>
<p></br>“Thin ice, Brent Kim. Thin ice.”</p>
</br>
<p></br>To add to the fact that this chick was pretty, she was also a competent lifter with some solid mechanics. I asked her what she finished with after her squats, and she told me that she didn’t know – her parental units, who were handling her, wouldn’t tell her what she was lifting on the platform because she has a habit of over thinking the weight. But when she went in blind, and just methodically repeated what she did in the warm up room, she performed well. I knew instantly that I loved everything about her. She finished with a 286lbs squat, 171lbs bench, and 303lbs deadlift in the women’s 181lbs class. I was sold. Didn’t think I could ask for digits because she was with her parental units, but Justin encouraged me to tell her about 70s big – “Do it or I’ll do it for you” – and I would try to stalk her on facebook. I would ultimately fail, and feel that I would never see her again, but she ended up finding me and after a month or two of chatting decided we should hang out.</p>
</br>
<p></br>We’re a pretty typical, gross couple now, i.e. holding hands in public, which I think is awesome, and we decided it’d be a pretty cool date if I came to lift in Maryland’s state powerlifting meet with her.</p>
</br>
<p></br>I ended up not being able to lift with her because of the 60 lifter cap, and I was a guest lifter so in-state lifter entries take priority over mine, but I still went to see her and help out at the meet.</p>
</br>
<p></br>I loaded and spotted for probably a third of the meet, which was a fair amount of work, partially because a lot of state records were being broken at this meet and there was a fairly strong talent pool present, but pretty satisfying at the end of the day when it was all over. This is the first meet I’ve ever been to in which I did not lift. Met quite a few people from 70sbig, and you can hear all about their exploits in the comment threads of previous posts. Most notable was something that JMOvechkin said to me as I was passing by, “Spotting isn’t a sport,” which I thought was FUCKING awesome.</p>
</br>
<p></br>His brother also asked me if he should take his third deadlift attempt, after rating his second attempt at 501lbs to be a 9/10 difficulty.</p>
</br>
<p></br>“You’re asking me if you should just stop at your second attempt?”</p>
</br>
<p></br>“Yeah.”</p>
</br>
<p></br>“Uhhh I’m never going to tell you to not take a third attempt, but I’m reckless. Quitting isn’t a sport.”</p>
</br>
<p></br>“Yeah,” he answered, “And I’m not a quitter.”</p>
</br>
<p></br>Boom? Boom.</p>
</br>
<p></br>He ended up pulling 507lbs for his final attempt of the meet.</p>
</br>
<p></br>Becca, who was the main motivation for me being at the meet, also produced a strong performance despite not making weight by 2lbs. She dropped 11lbs in about a week, but started cutting too late. Throw in about a hundred other factors that would screw with her preparation in the final days leading up to the meet, and things didn’t look good. She ended up lifting as an extra, but would break some PRs despite horrendous rest and recovery.</p>
</br>
<p></br>I asked her to type a write up for her meet experience, but she declined and asked me to do it instead, so –</p>
</br>
<p></br>She went 9 for 9, and squatted 281lbs pretty easily. Her squats were iffy in the weeks leading up to the meet so her step-dad and coach was conservative here, but she PRed by 11lbs in the bench press with 182lbs, and 17lbs in the deadlift with 320lbs. I loaded and spotted all of her attempts and it was pretty sweet to watch my girlfriend wreck shit. She brought some intensity into her third attempts, which is apparently rare – Becca says that she’s never made noises when she lifted, but she was pretty fierce, especially with her third attempt bench and deadlift. Her efforts would earn her best lifter. I’m pretty proud of her, and seeing her commit to every single lift reaffirmed that I like everything about her. Watching her on the platform reminded me why my heart yearned for her in the beginning. You can tell a lot about a girl from how she performs under the bar at a meet.</p>
</br>
<p></br>It would have been a lot cooler if I was lifting at this meet, but can’t really complain that I still got to help with keeping the meet operational. “Giving back to the sport” is pretty pretentious and sentimental, and Brent Kim doesn’t really do sentimental, but generally speaking, raw powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting wouldn’t survive in the US without a lot of volunteer effort. Running meets is a lot of work, and in Olympic weightlifting it’s pretty common that meet organizers lose money with the event. But the athletes need to compete, and someone has to put in the money and hours and not expect to get very much in return. It was a good experience to be on the other side of things, “the strength training community” means a lot more when a bunch of powerlifters work together to run a meet.</p>
</br>
<p></br>In short, strength training is love, quitting isn’t a sport, and help your fellow man.</p>
</br>
<p></br>Delta Command out. (When I called Justin to let him know I would be writing an article for the site, I told him, “Hunter Two-One this is Delta Command, we’ll be taking over operations on the battlefield until the situation’s been brought under control.”)</p>
