    Uncle John says, 'And who's your lover?'
  </p>
</div>
<p>Gerard sent me today’s beard and it was too amusing to ignore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve enclosed a photo of my wife’s Uncle John, a big, tough,pipe smoking, whiskey drinking Irish farmer. An eccentric, his opening line to strangers is always “And who’s your lover”?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-key-to-longevity">The Key To Longevity</h2>
<p>I’ve been fortunate enough to have worked with a lot of different people; young, old, big, little, fat, skinny, healthy, and various health problems or anatomical issues. I’m always impressed by folks who most young people consider “old”. This is anything above the age of 45, and especially over the age of 55 and 60. I honestly don’t consider my friends in this age range as “old” — mostly because when I’m that age I will refuse to consider myself old. Ever since I was younger I wanted to show that good eating and exercise/training habits would be the formula for longevity.</p>
<p>Because of this I’m infatuated with people who are outliers compared to old people. The norm of older adults consists of being out of shape, unhealthy, and taking plenty of medication. They can’t really enjoy the same activities they did when they were younger because “life got in the way”. I’m not chastising them; full-time jobs, families, and the government telling you how to eat and exercise is hard to overcome. Yet in spite of all of that, there are people who are in great shape, don’t ache constantly (or cite such aching for their immobility), and are active, healthy “old people”.</p>
<p>I like talking to these friends or acquaintances to see how they did it. I like to ask them how old they are, compliment them on their success, and most importantly, ask them what the constant has been in their lives. The answer is always slightly different, but it can be derived to the same idea; they have always been active. None of them have ever said, “I eat a specific diet,” or “I’m just lucky”. They always have been consistent with activity and exercise.</p>
<p>One of my friends in Texas is 65 years old and has a hobby of climbing mountains. He has always been a fan of hiking, running, and exercising. He lifts in Rippetoe’s WFAC, so he squats and deadlifts on a semi-regular basis (easily handling 225 for reps in both lifts), and has chiseled calves that most of you would buy if you could. I recently met another man, 59 years old, who has sculpted pecs and biceps that would put us all to shame and he has enjoyed running throughout his life. Another friend is around 63 and has always enjoyed cycling. Dr. Kilgore is in his early 50s and has always enjoyed lifting and has pretty good blood lipid levels (and has had a total of six months of endurance/conditioning training accumulated in his entire life). This small sample size of close friends lean towards endurance exercise, yet they all engage in weight training regularly.</p>
<p>As a person ages, their training will probably reflect that of a generalist approach. They should lift enough to maintain their strength (or improve it if it’s lacking) and do some kind of “cardio” related activity to maintain a baseline of cardiovascular and respiratory function. Focusing on one or the other may neglect some important health benefits, yet severely lacking in strength will cause problems into very old age. Common examples are getting off the toilet, carrying groceries, and maneuvering stairs and steps without struggle or injury. Full body loading will allow the muscles to continue applying force to move the body or external objects and keep structures like bones and tendons from injuring easily (which will avoid things like stepping off the curb and breaking a hip). Yet all of this is for naught if the older person tries to implement it when they are already old; taking the preventative measure will have that trim and healthy when they achieve oldness. The preventative measure is not taking a break from exercise and activity. The only way to ensure that your body avoids adapting to a lack of activity (insert image of the unable sedentary person here) is to consistently exercise, train, and move.</p>
<p>If you plan on being around when you’re older, this should put things in a different perspective. Failing that PR squat isn’t as traumatic because it’s a process. Thirty years from now, your failed PR will just be a training day. Training assumes that progress is the goal (otherwise it’s just working out), and the overall goal is to still be able to train when you’re 50, 60, or 70 years old. It’s hard to look at the big picture when you’re young, but the best thing you can do is commit to a life of exercise and activity, no matter what’s going on in your life. There are 24 hours in a day, and 96 segments of 15 minutes in that span. If you can’t take two of those 96 segments to train several days a week, then you won’t have to worry about being around when you’re old.</p>
<p>And since the CrossFit people are already considering it, nutrition doesn’t mean dick if you aren’t exercising. If the body isn’t experiencing an event that will make it perform better, then fuel or hormonal manipulation through diet is worthless (unless you’re doing a hardcore calorie deficit, but that’s just weird, and you’ll end up 90’s small and breaking a hip when you leave Wal-Mart’s senior citizen sale). Force your body to be more efficient through consistent exercise; it’s what fit older people have done.</p>

    903 pound WR deadlift by Doyal Kenady
  </p>
</div>
<p>Doyle Kenady weighed 305 pounds of, as you can see, grizzled muscle. Dr. Fred Hatfield (AKA Dr. Squat) pays tribute to Doyle (he gives him the honor of Dr. Deadlift) in <a href="http://drsquat.com/blog/drsquat/2010/03/03/doyle-kenady">this excellent article</a> written in Powerlifting USA (November, 1986). The world record at the time was Bill Kazmaier’s 886. This may not seem like much nowadays since the 1,000 pound barrier has been breached and there are amazing deadlifters like Andy Bolton, Benedikt Magnusson, and Konstantin Konstantinovs. Yet it was still the world record, and Kazmaier was a powerlifting phenom before he transitioned to a career in strongman competitions.</p>
<p>Kenady’s performance in this meet is amazing. I’ll let Dr. Squat give you the recap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doyle’s lift will take a special place in the history of great lifts because he did his record buster after massive attempts in the squat and bench press only minutes before. His deadlift was done under the most trying of circumstances possible, under near crippling conditions of fatigue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, it was his third attempt that cracked the 900 pound barrier. Imagine! Two attempts in the squat, one of which was over 900 pounds; three attempts in the bench press, all over 500 pounds; then two attempts over 830 pounds in the deadlift before pulling the heaviest, official record breaking deadlift of mankind to an erect standing position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hatfield also recounts how Doyle called for a 4th attempt (allowed after setting a world record) and got it to just above his knees despite having to follow his own attempt. I’m sitting here in disbelief; breaking past 900 pounds — when it has never been done before — to set the world record without taking token squat and bench attempts is amazing. No wonder they called this guy “Sasquatch” and “Grizzly Bear” — two of the most bad ass nicknames ever.</p>
<p>Kenady was an amazing athlete, yes, but I want to point out that all of the people that met him or knew him said that he was a very laid back guy. He was kind, supportive, and helpful. Humble and amiable. Kenady had the look of a bad ass but was a genuine nice guy; what a man should be. In a time where athletes trash talk each other and want attention, I look up to Kenady for his “old school” personality. I look up to him as an athlete as well as a man; he is the epitome of a 70’s Big attitude.</p>

<p><em>Edit: Doyle is no longer living; apparently he died of heart disease. His training consisted of the three big lifts without much assistance work, and his schedule had more rest days than training days. Read Dr. Hatfield’s article and he tells a story of training with Kenady a few weeks before the meet — Doyle pulled 895 for a triple!</em></p>

<h2 id="what-have-you8230">What have you…</h2>
<p>I was listening to Colin Cowherd on ESPN Radio today, and he was addressing two things; that he was allegedly a contrarian, and that Mike Vick is an NFL MVP candidate. Cowherd is in his mid 40s and explained that our society is more “knee-jerk” for a variety of reasons (knee-jerk meaning we respond intensely to things immediately and change our minds collectively). We are a nation of young people; young adults have grown up in the technology era playing videogames, experiencing the boom of the internet, and now we’re in the “social media” age. Information can virally spread within minutes across the globe with Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Our attention spans are much shorter and our actions are hasty. I know that I run out of things to look at on the internet quickly because I navigate it so fast. I type and click like the wind (it’s necessary for StarCraft).</p>
<p>Cowherd blamed this societal development for the knee-jerk reaction of campaigns flaring up for Vick as the Most Valuable Player in the NFL when he is 19th in the league in passing touchdowns, has only played in 6 of 9 games (and only played in half of one of those games), and his best stats come against mid-level or struggling teams (Redskins are strugglin’ like Brent trying to flex his biceps). The Vick argument aside, Cowherd has a point. There are knee-jerk reactions to everything. If you’ve looked in a “Muscle and Fitness” (or Fiction, as Kilgore likes to say) magazine, it is FILLED with one-time studies and over-generalizations. A study will show that something may be vaguely correlated, and those experts will immediately implement it into their advice (and may even draw up a 15 page article complete with 87 pictures of shaved dudes working out and flexing all the muscles that aren’t involved in the movement). M&amp;F isn’t the only magazine that does this; any major magazine that has any kind of health section will list one research study (without even discussing whether it was a good study to begin with) and generalizing the results. And the general public reads this shit and Eats. It. Up. (to clarify: they don’t actually eat shit).</p>
<p>This is part of the reason why the fitness industry seems like it isn’t salvageable. So much crap has been fed to the layman for 30+ years, it’s hard to say that everyone should know better. The only constant among any of this is that progressive overload training with weights yields strength and muscle while intensity is a must for quality conditioning. Those ideals existed long before the aerobics hysteria and they continue their action today behind the scenes. Relevant research that supports the fundamental ideals is kinda shady since the industry as a whole is what drives research (and funding). It will be even harder to dig the layman out of the shit pile that they find themselves wallowing in. But I will continue wielding the shovel, gently displacing piles of poo until so that I can lead them from their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">cave of shadows</a> (I wish I didn’t have to link my references although I didn’t link the “Of Mice and Men” reference yesterday).</p>
<p>Two things have to be in effect for the truth to sprout. First, the community that “gets it” — and understands how proper fitness works — shouldn’t look down on the unknowing. Plato couldn’t just bust in the cave and say, “Yo my peoples, yous have been checkin’ out da shadows your whole life, and yous is a bit thick,” (apparently Plato talks like Ali G). Instead we will respectfully lead them in the right direction by teaching them how it can benefit them. We aren’t going to scare them into believing (cough — religion, cough, cough) or coerce them into doing it (cough — tyranny, cough, cough). Secondly, we have to be more scientific about mainstream reporting on research studies that allegedly change medicine, exercise, or health. Find the original studies, determine whether or not it was a good study, and see if it can be generalizable to an entire population. Most often it can’t be — imagine trying to say that something applies to everyone in a world where a gothic teen is the same species as an NFL offensive lineman. Keep a clear head in spite of new fangled research, diets, and training methods. Maintain a commitment to the things that work over and over again, yet keep your mind open in light of development. Ask questions and learn all you can. It won’t make you popular (every time I ask questions at a workshop or seminar, people get angry and have even written nasty things on the internet about it), but it will help you learn.</p>
<p>Helping you learn is all I care about.</p>

<h2 id="warning">WARNING</h2>
<p>70’s Big may cause adverse effects in your life by changing your physique and/or mentality. Take careful note of these possibilities and verify that you are prepared for such changes.</p>
<p><strong>Abnormal Increases In Size</strong></p>
<p>Beginning a proper quest to 70’s Big will result in exceptional increases in muscular development. This may cause problems if you are A) emo, B) attend art school, or C) live in California or Europe. Expect the following:</p>
<p>– you will fill out your 70’s Big shirts</p>
<p>– your pants will no longer fit</p>
<p>– there is a 50% chance that your clothing will rip and fall right off of your body in fear</p>
<p>– your underwear/spandex will become uncomfortable unless you upgrade</p>
<p>– if you wear swim trunks with the netting on the inside, it will wedge up your butt crack because you’ll have amazing glutes (if I do say so myself)</p>
<p>– dress shirts will not fit around your neck, even if you get fitted for a tux/suit for the specific reason of having it fit (he even measured my neck, wtf?)</p>
<p><strong>Uncomfortable Gains In Strength</strong></p>
<p>Your abnormal size gains express an uncomfortable (dare I say uncanny?) increase in strength. Take caution with your daily activities as they are now a smaller percentage of your absolute strength. Beware of the following:</p>
<p>– hug your lady carefully lest you suffocate her (don’t be Lennie Small)</p>
<p>– avoid fine China</p>
<p>– exhibit caution when pretending to be a zombie in order to show your friends what it would be like to be attacked by an intense zombie…who lifts weights…</p>
<p>– consider projectile motion trajectory when tossing children in the pool; anything other than a resultant vector in the vertical direction could land the child on the roof, a busy highway, or a grizzly bear den</p>
<p>– ready yourself for accusations of steroids or alien anal probing, for it is unnatural to the average person that you have doubled your squat and gained 25 pounds of muscle in a couple of months</p>
<p><strong>Stark Changes In Personality</strong></p>
<p>With this size and strength you will be overcome with a sense of honor and pride that throws itself intensely into tasks of self betterment. You will find yourself:</p>
<p>– knocking down personal goals</p>
<p>– ready to take on the trials of life</p>
<p>– and doing so with an intensity and focus that ripples the earth to its iron-nickel alloy core</p>
<p><strong>Heed this warning; 70’s Big is a process that results in unfathomable changes.</strong></p>

<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p>In the fall of 2008, I was getting bored with the bodybuilding routine I was doing. It had been a few years since I played (very small-time) football in college and intramural sports were the only thing I “competed” in. I decided I wanted more of a performance type training program because I didn’t want to lose my athletic ability. My friend Shawn and I were catching a pump in our workout (it was probably arms, and I was probably pissed), and I spontaneously decided I wanted to run a mile.</p>
<p>You see, back in high school I could run a mile close to 6 minutes routinely (I weighed between 185-195 and played linebacker). I wanted to go upstairs to the indoor track and run a mile in 6 minutes. I don’t know why, but I just wanted to know if I “still had it” I guess. This turned out to be one of the worst experiences ever, and I want you to learn why.</p>
<p>The recreation facilities indoor track was short; it would take 9 laps to complete a mile. It was 15 minutes until the top of the hour, and I had to train someone…so I needed to be quick. I figured that was plenty of time; a few minutes of loosening up, run the mile, change clothes, and get started. Yeah, not so much.</p>
<p>I loosed up briefly (I like dynamic stretching, still do), readied my wrist watch, and stepped onto the track. I beeped my watch and got started at a pretty good click. I’ve got this pretty good pace, and I completed lap one, no big deal. Now, stop and imagine this. There’s this 203 pound guy running on the indoor track. Well, running isn’t the right word, I’m kind of bounding along. And then I have to dodge a person every now and then (there were a few walkers and joggers, what have you). Those pedestrians see me repeatedly, and I’m making more of a fuss each time.</p>
<p>You see, the first two laps weren’t that big of a deal, but all kinds of shit was going on in my body. Lactic acid started filling in my legs. The phospho creatine system no longer could supply ATP at my work load, and the glycolitic system was also unable to do much since I really hadn’t trained it all that much — especially at this workload. It turns out that riding a bike to class isn’t really an adaptive stress.</p>
<p>I don’t remember what happened on the middle laps, but I do remember lap 8 and 9 (this is Brent’s favorite part of the story). At this point, I’m convinced I’m going to die. I felt as if I was breathing through a snorkel and mask. My legs didn’t want to move. But I pushed ahead as hard as I could. By god I wanted to get that 6 minute mile. My bounding turns into more of a blundering as I’m struggling to keep my velocity. My breathing turns into gigantic rhinoceros breaths; I sounded like a cow giving a horned mating call to the African plains. Every time I breathed out it was a mixture of forced expiration and a sharp moan. As I neared the end it became gorilla-like, frantic. I pounded each step and pushed forward as hard as I could. Remember, there are people on the track, so they’re seeing this dude finishing a mile like he’s sprinting the last leg of the Badwater Marathon. I probably looked like an asshole.</p>
<p>I blew by the finish line and beeped my watch. I didn’t fall down on the ground (at this point in my life, it had never occurred to me to fall on the ground after doing something difficult; athletes usually stay on their feet because the game isn’t over), and waved my watch in front of my face. It read “5:31”. Elation. I did it. I continued to hyperventilate forever, but I walked over and told some of my friends who worked at the facility my time. I continuously said, “I’m not doing that ever again. Ever.” I wish I could say this was the end of the story, but the worst part hasn’t even happened yet.</p>
<p>I don’t know if any of you have done something intense when you aren’t adapted to it at all, but your body is confused. It experiences this work load, this stress that it isn’t accustomed to, and there are repercussions for this stupidity. My stomach started bubbling. I sneezed. I was still sweating profusely, still breathing hard, but my system seemed to be shutting down. My eyes became swollen, and my stomach bubbled. Again.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, I’m not gonna make it to the toilet,” is a censored version of what I thought to myself. I staggered to the bathroom, a journey that was more difficult than lap number 9. I sneezed. Again and again. As I walked into the bathroom I sneezed uncontrollably. Snot poured out of my nose and probably flew everywhere. The constant sneezing seemed to be shaking up the apparent chemical reaction in my stomach. I’m not going to explain in detail what happened, but it was very similar to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7l6jg4Hlog&amp;feature=related">THIS</a>, yet way worse because I was constantly sneezing. I lost count at 47 sneezes.</p>
<p>I sat on the toilet for at least 15 minutes. After I finally stopped sneezing (after what seemed like half an hour), I sat there, sweating, exhausted, and nauseated. What happened next is the worst part about all of this; my sinuses turned into concrete. Everything in my head cemented itself into place and I could only breathe out of my throat. My eyes felt like they were being pushed forward, like when you shoot ping pong balls out of those <a href="http://www.impexol.cn/Files/UpFiles/Toys/Toy_Guns/Ping-Pong_Gun.jpg">air guns</a>. I washed myself, dressed myself, and went downstairs to my personal training client 18 minutes after the top of the hour. I could talk, but I was so congested that I sounded like Meg Ryan if she were to get beaten with a golf club and then waterboarded.</p>
<p>So what in the hell is the moral of the story? When you’re doing something new, or something you haven’t done in a long time (i.e. you are unadapted to it), ease into the activity over time. If you have been lifting and want to be able to run a mile without feeling like crap, then do a light walk/run fartlek workout. If you’re wanting to do hill sprints on sand and haven’t even ran yet, then get adapted to running before sprinting. In my example above, I experienced systemic responses because I wasn’t systemically ready for it (by the way, you have to be strong enough to push yourself hard enough to get systemically fucked up, if you’re weak then it isn’t possible). The two running examples in this paragraph are more relevant to the localized structural stress in your joints and legs. You don’t want to have sore knees from jogging a mile when you haven’t ran in a year and half, and you certainly don’t want to pull a muscle trying to sprint since it will limit all of your other training too.</p>
<p>Don’t be stupid or stubborn; ease yourself into new activity. If you don’t, you can have a miserable experience like I did one night, or you’ll cause an injury that will last longer than sitting on the toilet. In either case, bad programming is to fault. You’ve been warned.</p>

<p>Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day">Veteran’s Day</a>, Remembrance Day, or Armistice Day depending on where you live in the world. I’m sure you’ll see events on television or experience moments of silence. I’ll ask two things of the American readers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remember the the cost of creating our country. While this is a stereotypical sentiment, consider the individual sacrifices it took to have a country of our own. Freedom from tyranny was worth dying for and it was worth the struggle to create a republic with individual rights and opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the individual sacrifice it took all those years ago in a rebellious fight for freedom. Now look at the image above and think about every single battle that has been fought since to preserve that freedom, that way of life. Wars and battles occur for a multitude of reasons, but the men and women who lead this country chose war and violence in order to protect and preserve our freedom (even if that reason only made up a small part of that decision). The sacrifice doesn’t lie with the country, but the individual and his family. You can read the book <em>1776</em> by David McCullough to read about the sacrifices of George Washington and his band of starving farmers. You can read <em>Band of Brothers</em> by Stephen Ambrose to read the story of how Dick Winters and Easy Company fought and survived through World War II. Nowadays you can go to any base or post throughout the country and see the personnel who continue the, for lack of a better term, tradition of upholding our freedom. These are Americans who have chosen to not only risk their lives, but ironically give up their own freedom to a country that aims to preserve liberty. The real hero in America is the mother who holds steady with two children while her husband deploys halfway around the world. The real hero is the husband who kisses his daughters one last time as he he leaves for his year long PCS in Korea. The Americans serving in the military and their families bear the individual sacrifice of preserving freedom so that you don’t have to think about it. And that’s what makes them heroes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Today think of the past and think of the present. Place your politics aside and be thankful that these people exist, and they always will.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to make of it. In both cases the cap for heavyweights was lowered and the minimum changed (men’s increased, women’s decreased). I know that Chris won’t be slimming down to the 265 lbs weight class, so it looks like he’ll be a super heavyweight. There’s speculation of why the weight classes were changed, but I’m not familiar with the variables that went into the official decision (I’m sure there are a lot of pissed off dudes). Feel free to share any info you find.</p>
<p>Additionally, I always look at the USAPL as the standard in powerlifting. I’ve had issues with their judging (and other people have echoed the same), but it’s one federation that is prominent throughout the country. I’m not a fan of having eight thousand different federations (Hitler is most definitely NOT a fan either, see video below). It seems that the changing weight classes will just stir the pot around a bit more and promote disparity between feds. Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Beard of the Day</strong> goes to Brian Daboll, Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator, who called a HELL of a game against the New England Patriots last Sunday. He sported a decent beard (and a shaved head, so he looks extra creepy) in the big victory in which running back Peyton Hillis rushed had over 200 yards of offense (184 yards of bruising, biceps-led rushing), and Colt McCoy pulled his weight in completing 74% of his passes, making key third down throws, and scoring a rushing touchdown. More importantly, this fired Daboll the. fuck. up. He basically attacked McCoy after his rushing touchdown and almost knocked him over. Finally…something to be glad about as a Browns fan.</p>

  <p>I got an e-mail from Kat, who trains at CrossFit Regina. She told me that Angela Desjarlais is someone who stands out and portrays what it is to be 70’s Big.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AngDesj, as she’s affectionately known around our region is an amazingly strong and fierce chick, she’s a seasoned competitor, mother of 2 and a shift worker. She finds time to stay fit and strong at Crossfit Regina, Regina Saskatchewan and participates in the 70’s big Challenges regularly. We’ve held a tactical strength, shoulder press/deadhang pullup, and Supertotal and she’s come out 1st in all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a piece that Angela wrote for this post:</p>
<p>I started powerlifting at age 21. My dad (now a retired firefighter) had been competing for a few years already. A few years ago he won a World Record in Bench Press for Grand Masters at 399lbs in the 82.5kg weight Category in Drug Free Powerlifting, among many other Provincial, Canadian Records. He is currently training to get this title back. I had just started the Police Department and would work out with him. He put me under the bar and said, “see if you can bench that (I think it was 80lbs), it went up well and before you know it I was benching 135lbs (I weigh 148ish), a few months later. I guess it’s in the blood.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few years I started the other lifts. I competed in a variety of local competitions, some provincially and a national competition. I was at my leanest when I was powerlifiting and would not consider myself bulky whatsoever. Ballsy yes, bulky no (<em>Editor’s Note: <a href="http://vimeo.com/4924117">Proof</a></em>).</p>

<p>My dad then suggests I compete in The Toughest Competitor Alive at the Police/Fire Games which has eight events. 5km run, shot put, 100m sprint, 100m swim, rope climb, bench press, deadhang pull-ups and an obstacle course. I have competed at the Police/Fire Can/Am Games and the Police/Fire World Games and medaled in both powerlifting, bench alone, and the TCA.</p>
<p>Again, my dad suggested I try CrossFit, to help me train for an upcoming Police/Fire World Games, which I won a bronze. So like a good little daughter I did. I loved it! It encompasses everything I enjoy, lifting heavy shit, running, various other bizarre exercises, competing, oh and I did I mention lifting heavy shit.</p>
<p>Interesting enough all my powerlifting lifts totally increased once I started CrossFit. All my equipped lifts turned to my best raw lifts. My raw lifts are currently bench press 190lbs, squat 280lbs, deadlift (my goat) 305lbs. CrossFit Regina Coaches/Owners, Aaron and Robin Maier focus on good form, proper technique, which was where I was really lacking. I suffered or rather still suffer from a back injury and an injured tailbone and when I came to them I started my lifts from scratch. Hard on the ego, but good on the body. I discovered my weaknesses – FLEXIBILITY — and worked on it. It has paid me back tenfold. I am still embarrassingly inflexible in my shoulders, I can bench press a grown man, but have difficulty with a muscle up.</p>
<p>I have also competed in 5km races, and some ½ Marathons, a beer drinking contest and a milk chugging contest. I won the beer drinking contest. My proudest achievement is I have two beautiful daughters, who see their Mommy lift, run, compete and enjoy every moment. They will grow up with the knowledge that woman are supposed to be strong and can wear lip gloss too.</p>
<p>I am motivated by the wise words of my Father: “Don’t suck”, “Don’t embarrass the family” and my favorite “Visualize what its like for me when I get all my medals”.</p>
