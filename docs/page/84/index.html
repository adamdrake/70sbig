  <p>I think yesterday’s post is pretty important and relevant to most of you. At least go over the information and use it to start actively thinking about what you do in training. If you’d like to spark more discussion, then add it to yesterday’s comments.</p>
<p>—–</p>
<p>I don’t know who <a href="http://www.warrickbrant.com.au/">Warrick Brant</a> was before my friend Jacob sent me a video of him front squatting 350kg.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_1YtwIMg1o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>This dude is cocked diesel and a solid Australian competitor. From his profile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Breaking my neck in 2001 and having multiple screws and plates put in to hold my neck together, I realised how important it is to do the things you love and to never give up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since then I have won multiple powerlifting and strongman titles and have never been defeated in Australia or by any other Australian athlete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently he’s stomping ass in Australia. Apparently he’s been a big dude <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X5e6r2DnVE">for a while</a>. Here is a vid of him doing a 412kg car deadlift:</p>

  <p>Dr. Kilgore and I did a preliminary case study in 2009 to determine if there was a correlation between oxygen saturation (in this case a lack thereof) and conditioning improvement. Kilgore himself was the subject and we had very interesting pre and post data points. He had been on a strength program for five or six months and the case study was a four week conditioning storm that included one day each of squatting, pressing, and deadlifting per week. We were still active with CrossFit at the time, and there are a couple benchmark workouts we used as tests. However, the four weeks consisted of carefully programmed conditioning workouts that wouldn’t have been possible to do had Kilgore not been so relatively strong.</p>
<p>Kilgore posted about this on his fitness related blog a few weeks ago. Let me know if you have any questions, and if there is a question for Kilgore, then I can probably have him jump in here and answer it. I’ll elaborate in this entry throughout the day if necessary.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://ironunderground.com/blog/2010/09/15/data/">Questioning the Fit</a>” post by Kilgore that includes the pre/post .pdf sheet.</p>
<p>—–</p>
<p>This post is perhaps one of the most relevant and important things to be put on this site, so I guess I’m going to have to explain why.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dr. Kilgore was 50 years old in the first run of this case study. He had zero conditioning adaptation. After having an important surgery that halted other things in life, he was on a strength program for about half a year. Thus, he was as de-conditioned as you can get. We repeated the case study a SECOND time about a year later. Lon was equally de-conditioned (the last time he did conditioning was the first run through of the case study) and he was weaker (hadn’t been strength training up to the second run through as he had the first run through).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we were specifically looking at was trying to bring down his oxygen saturation. The hypothesis was that this is a relevant metric for inducing a stress for improved adaptation. It may not even be an important metric, but there aren’t many that are testable regarding conditioning. The way I have thought about is that if we achieve a significant desaturation of O2 (in this case, we were shooting for at least a 4% reduction, hypoxemia in normal circumstances at sea level), that creates a deficit in substrates. A significant deficit in substrates is something that the body isn’t used to (especially in Lon’s case), so it must go through the adaptation process. In other words, O2 lowers (and whatever else that may be going on that we can’t easily measure), the body freaks out and goes, “Holy shit, we aren’t used to this, let’s improve the relevant physiology so that we can handle this same work load in the future or, god help us, handle a higher work load.” We show that in four weeks this was a very significant method of stressing Lon’s body to hugely increase his ability to do work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2a. No, we aren’t saying the results are generalized to a greater population. We aren’t stupid. However, there are many people that have attained very good fitness or conditioning levels with high intensity exercise. Most of us have seen this work before, but never really quantified it.</p>
<p>2b. No, we aren’t suggesting that 02 saturation is a giant cog in the metabolic process. However, I think that it should garner relevant attention.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The pre/post tests were done in a specific order. I just realized that all of these aren’t in the document, so I’ll do my best to elaborate.</li>
</ol>
<p>We tested ‘strength only’ with the lifts. We tested ‘endurance only’ with the run and row (although in retrospect, I would have increased the rowing distance from 1,000m to 2k or 2.5k to improve the relevancy of the test). Then we had an assortment of conditioning workouts from CrossFit. One was solely calisthenic based (“Cindy”), one was calisthenic and lifting based (“Diane”), and another was completely implement based. If you look at the first page of the document, you’ll see vast improvements in the tests that are included and Lon did not do worse on any pre/post test.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>You’ll notice his results weren’t as good after the second run through. Lon and I are of the opinion that since he wasn’t as strong, he wasn’t able to push as hard in the workouts to achieve similar stresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More importantly, in order to achieve greater stresses strength was necessary. If you don’t have adequate stress, you aren’t able to push as hard or as long, and therefore can’t impose an adaptive stress on the system. Furthermore, if you are weaker, you are going to be a helluva lot more sore than if you were stronger. Lon experienced this firsthand, and during the first case study, he even said, “I couldn’t imagine being able to do this not being as strong as I am.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, Lon go weaker during the first phase, but what do you expect? He was squatting once on Monday, pressing once on Tuesday, and Deadlifting once on Thursday. This case study along, with my observations of the CrossFit class I had on similar programming, clearly showed me that this wasn’t enough strength training to improve strength, let alone maintain it. However, that point is relevant to the person(s) on a given program. If someone required significant conditioning increases and was already strong, they could achieve significant conditioning adaptations in a very short amount of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This case study has many limitations but it creates many questions. If you look at it from a hard science perspective, then there needs to be follow up research. If you look at it from a practicality and experiential standpoint, you know this kind of thing is already happening. There are certain requirements that will make it so:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7a. The program is very, very carefully programmed.</p>
<p>7b. Each workout must achieve an intensity level that is a ‘significant stress’. Recovery between these bouts of high intensity should be minimized over time. In other words, higher outputs and minimizing recovery are the goals. You can’t do this in workouts that are longer than 15 minutes — you can’t sustain such high outputs that long. Most workouts Lon did here (and what I would program) are under 12 minutes with the majority around the 8 minute mark.</p>
<p>There are many more conclusions and questions that I can draw from all of this, but I won’t spoon feed you any more. I’m open to productive discussion.</p>

  <p>I’ve had quite a few e-mails on how to taper the Texas Method for a meet, so we are going to discuss the general strategy here. The TM itself is not set in stone and can be tweaked for an individual lifter. As the lifter you will have to make well-informed decisions to ensure that your program is helping you and not hurting you. This taper method I am talking about is something I have used a few times and it worked well. The lifters that used it were all young guys who are in the upper echelon of strength and they were all on some different ‘tweak’ of the TM (although I’ve had a 30 and 40 year old taper pretty much the same way with success). They were also new or still relatively new to competing in meets, and this is an assumption that the taper makes. As someone advances in skill (in the meet) or training (needing more complicated program or needing to almost periodize), the taper will function differently. Not to mention that when someone has a lot of meet experience, they will start learning how they need to taper (everyone will be slightly different). Let me clarify once again: this is a beginner’s taper on a TM program. In the grand scheme of things, TM is still a beginner powerlifting program, albeit a useful gateway.</p>
<p>I will assume someone is running a 5×5 volume day with a rep max on intensity day. If you differ, then just apply the changes to your format (instead of doing 8 sets of 3 on volume day, you’d shift to 4 or 5 in the example below). The number on the left indicates how many weeks out from the meet the lifter is. Zero is the week of the meet, one is one week out, etc. Basically at the start of this taper volume is reduced on volume day down to three sets instead of five sets. Intensity day was hopefully consisting of heavy triples in the last couple months, and now it will be converted to singles with the taper. This is for a few reasons: A) it reduces the volume a little, B) it allows the lifter to start adapting to heavier weights, and, most importantly, C) it allows the lifter to practice the lifts within the regulations of the federation they are lifting in. Deadlifting will be a little different, but you shouldn’t pull within ten days of the meet, and lately I’ve been leaning towards a full two weeks out.</p>
<p>I will treat the training schedule as MWF. If you lift on different days, then intelligently slide the schedule over.</p>
<p>3 – MON: 3 to 5 sets of 5, WED: normal light day w/ regular press, FRI: singles* with rules**, heavier deadlift workout</p>
<p>2 – MON: 3 sets of 5, WED: normal w/ light press***, FRI: singles with rules, medium deadlift</p>
<p>1 – MON: 3 sets of 5, WED: normal (no press), FRI: singles with rules (no deadlift)</p>
<p>0 – MON: Work up to last warm-up, WED or THU: A few sets of very light work****, SAT: meet</p>
<p>That may be weird to read, but fuck it, I’m not going to make a nice, shiny table for you.</p>
<p>*If I was working with someone, I would have had them doing triples on intensity day for at least a month prior to this taper (and more comfortably for two months). Triples allow more weight to be put on the bar for intensity day than fives, and they are very descriptive for choosing openers at the meet. I’m assuming triples have been done up until this point for the taper above. When the lifter starts doing singles, they will single what their best triple is, and then based on how they feel they can go up or stay around that weight. If it was easy, they can put on five or ten pounds. The following week (two weeks out) they can really push the weight up based on how they did the previous week. One week out from the meet won’t be a max out session, but some singles around where they plan on opening with, and maybe a little above. I aim for three to five singles on these preparation days — more the farther out from the meet, then reducing the singles to about threeish the week before the meet unless the lifter is having issues with following the rules. The first day of singles they can do as many as seven in order to practice the rules.</p>
<p>**Look up and read the rules of whatever federation you’re in. USAPL has two commands on the squat: “start” and “rack”. Bench has three: start, press, and rack. You need to know the criteria you have to meet in order to be given permission to any of those actions. If you fuck this up, you will look silly, especially at a national meet like Mike and AC when it was no more than two seconds after I told them to listen to the commands.</p>
<p>***When the taper starts, you’ll be benching on volume/intensity day. In the TM, there is an emphasis on either press or bench every week, and I like to alternate it so that the last press week is four weeks out. This probably isn’t a big deal, but I like doing shit like then in programming. Just press on the light day as I have described. Same with the deadlift. That heavy deadlift workout could be a medium triple. I like to have the lifter pull a very heavy single somewhere between five and seven weeks out. Maybe eight. This constitutes as a heavy deadlift day and then is descriptive for what the lifter is capable of doing. Young and/or inexperienced meet lifters dislike not deadlifting a lot leading up to the meet, and they also dislike not deadlifting heavy. Mechanics differ when the weight gets heavy, so this makes sense for a lot of reasons. The last deadlift workout two weeks out could be working up to pulling a single around 80 to 85%.</p>
<p>****”Light work” constitutes doing a few sets of light fives. Chris, who has squatted 600 in competition will usually do a set of five at 135, 225, and 315, then move onto bench. After a few sets in squat and bench, go home. Oh, and cut out all your assistance work at the start of this taper. This includes doing stupid mother-fucking-ass-dipshit conditioning workouts. The whole fucking purpose of a taper is to allow a systemic peak via hormones. If you are causing systemic inflammation by being a fuck head and continuing your conditioning program, then you aren’t tapering and you sure as hell aren’t peaking. This is something that pisses Gant and I off, because it shows that the person is not committed to being a good athlete in the sport they are competing in and shows a huge level of incompetence (among other reasons). It’s okay to have some conditioning in your TM, but cut that shit out when you start tapering. Same with the assistance stuff.</p>
<p>More Notes: If you are particularly beat up in your training and you have been too stupid to alter it (this happens a lot, too much in fact), then you may consider starting a week earlier. Or you could reduce the volume and keep the intensity the same until you start the full-on taper. I know it’s hard, but don’t act completely oblivious to how your body is responding to your training. It makes my ears bleed when I ask someone, “Why did you keep doing it?” and they don’t have an answer.</p>
<p>This is not the only way to taper, but a taper is typically associated with a reduction in volume and less overall reps so that there will be a hormonal peak. Doing anything extra during this time, whether it be conditioning, assistance, or something stupid like max kipping pull-ups will be extremely fucking counter intuitive. If you are going to take the time in your life to train, then allow yourself proper cycles of hard training and light training. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve seen that fuck this up, and it’s easily corrected. Start doing it now.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments, post them in the comments. We can generate a discussion and I can make amendments to the above.</p>

  <p>70’s Big has always been about getting stronger, but in order to persistently get strong you need a kick-ass attitude. This whole “ass kickery” has developed into a demeanor that defines 70’s Big. Intense, hard work warrants a congratulatory, “that’s 70’s Big”. This is why we have the “<a href="/?p=2405">70’s Big Face</a>”; executing such a glare lets everyone know that you aren’t fucking around.</p>

<p>Intensity is another defining feature of 70’s Big; we all remember Chris and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9yHD2f64hk">third attempt deadlift</a> (children will hear this story for generations). That’s why I like the 105kg Olympic weightlifter Dmitry Klokov so much; the guy wants to lift the bar overhead and then <a href="http://www.lady00wrestling.com/sitebuilder/images/925-900x716.jpg">break it over his knee</a>.</p>

<p>Intensity is effective, but it’s useless without old school toughness. Recently Jeremy, Chris’ brother-in-law, played in a high school alumni football game. Jeremy grew up in Bowie, Texas shooting stuff, drinking beer, and bulldogging cattle. Unfortunately it had been over ten years since Jeremy could legally hit someone and take them to the ground, and that’s why he was excited to put the pads on one last time. Jeremy was an imposing force at middle linebacker against rival Henrietta …right up until a brawl cleared both benches at the end of the game (Texans take their football real fucking seriously).

  <p>The 2010 World Weightlifting Championships were over the last couple weeks in Antalya, Turkey. Unfortunately coverage is dismal for us Americans and the only videos we have are what we can scrounge on the internet. I’ll recap how the American lifters did and then highlight some other lifters.</p>
<p>You can find IWF results <a href="http://www.iwf.net/results/results_results.php?placecod=116">here</a>, and you can see all of the medal winners <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_World_Weightlifting_Championships">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re new to weightlifting, the number before their name is their weight class. Then their results are snatch/clean and jerk/total. You’ll also notice (hopefully?) that it’s in kilograms.</p>
<p>48kg Kelly Rexroad placed 17th with 74/84/155</p>
<p>58kg Amanda Sandoval placed 15th with 86/109/195</p>
<p>63kg Natalie Burgener placed 12th with 96/114/210</p>
<p>69 kg Layfield Danica Rue placed 19th with 90/115/205</p>
<p>75kg Erin Wallace placed 18th with 98/117/215</p>
<p>75kg Rachel Crass (who periodically posts on this site) placed 27th with 83/106/189</p>
<p>+75kg Sarah Robles placed 10th with 111/140/251</p>
<p>62kg Alex Lee placed 20th with 115/145/260</p>
<p>77kg Chad Vaughn placed 20th with 144/175/319 (I’ve met Chad a few times, he’s a good guy)</p>
<p>85kg Matt Bruce placed 25th with 150/180/330</p>
<p>85kg Kendrick Farris missed his three snatches and didn’t total. He’ll come back from it — we’re still rooting for you, Kendrick.</p>
<p>105kg Casey Burgener placed 25th with 162/189/351</p>
<p>105kg Donny Shankle (who is supposed to be crazy?) placed 31st with 155/189/344</p>
<p>+105kg Pat Judge placed 13th with 173/223/396</p>
<p>+105kg Collin Ito placed 25th with 146/200/346</p>
<p><strong>Other Notable Lifters</strong></p>
<p>My favorite lifter <a href="http://users.telenet.be/tom.goegebuer/images/Santa%20Domingo06/SD%20Beach1.jpg">Dmitriy Klokov</a> is always after the elusive gold medal. I couldn’t find what actually happened, but Klokov was in a heated battle with Marcin Dolega for the gold medal. I don’t know who attempted the 227 clean and jerk first, but Klokov missed it for his final C&amp;J attempt (it was his only miss that day). In the video, he looks pretty pissed about some potential plate wobbling that caused him to lose it (it’s hard to see, but there doesn’t seem to be anything noticeable). Dolega hit the 227 either before or after Klokov to win the gold medal on bodyweight (they tied in the total). Klokov came away with the gold in the snatch, but the silver in the C&amp;J and total. Dolega won the overall gold, gold in the C&amp;J, and bronze in the snatch. I hope we eventually get some video on this battle, but here’s Klokov’s footage (it’s distorted vertically):</p>

<p>Here is a video from the crowd of <a href="http://www.owresource.com/multimedia/images/chigishev/chigishev03wc3.jpg">Chigishev</a> snatching 210 for gold. It looks pretty damn hard, yet it’s still 1kg shy of his PR from 2005. Chigishev bombed out of the C&amp;J and therefore didn’t total. Bummer.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2w-hoNTAQlM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Those were just some quick highlights. If you’d like to add to the discussion by linking some of your favorite performances from the world championships, post them in the comments.</p>

  <p>**Note: It’s kind of difficult to link to another post on WordPress because if you publish the post you want to link, it will show up as the recent post on the home page. If anyone knows a way around this, let me know. Since I A) don’t have much time to write a post, B) talking about building quality food is important, and C) this didn’t get posted yesterday, I’m going to use it as the Wednesday post.</p>
<p>Note 2: The TSC is this month’s challenge, and it isn’t all that hard to do. <a href="/?p=1629">This</a> is how you do it, and <a href="/?p=2858">this</a> is where you post the results.**</p>
<p><em>The following is the text from an e-mail Harrison sent me.</em></p>
<p>This is a very simple, base version of the recipe. Feel free to experiment and add your own flavors. A few ideas I’ve tried: more spices like cumin, cayenne pepper, carraway, etc. Different cuts of meat. Different varieties of potatoes.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two huge pieces of beef (round eye, chuck, it doesn’t really matter. Get whatever is cheap.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rosemary and Thyme (fresh is better, dried is OK)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 cloves of garlic, minced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 large white onion, minced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pepper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beef broth or stock. You’ll need enough to cover the meat in the pot. Somewhere around 32 oz. Make your own with spare bones and trimmings from other meals if you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 cups white mushrooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8-12 Yukon Gold potatoes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 sticks of butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 cup of whole milk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4-6 handfuls of broccoli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 tomatoes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Olive oil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red wine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blue Crushed Velvet Suit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silver Medallion with Male Symbol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Italian Leather Shoes</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by heating a large pot (cast iron if you have it) on high. While it’s heating, rinse and pat dry the beef, then liberally season it with salt and pepper. Sear each side of the beef in the pan. Be patient. After like 45 seconds you’re going to want to turn it. Don’t do that. Give it a good 2-4 minutes/side. Set the oven to 350 F.</p>
<p>Add the broth, half of of the garlic and half of the herbs. No need to chop the herbs, just give them a good smash with something to get their juices flowing. I recommend using some kitchen twine to tie them all together for easy retrieval later. Cover and put in the oven for 3 and 1/2 hours.</p>
<p>Have your wife/roommate ensure that the house doesn’t burn down while you go to the gym.</p>
<p>Return from the gym and drink 1/2 gallon of milk and a sandwich. Then move on to beers, either Natty Boh, or a solid Brown Ale if it’s been a good year.</p>
<p>Chop the potatoes into equal sized cubes. At the 3.5 hours mark, put the potatoes on the stove and cover them with water. Add about 2 tsp salt to the water. Turn on the burner and boil for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove the lid from the pot and give everything a stir. Add the mushrooms, remaining garlic and half of the onions. Optional: add carrots, celery, cabbage, and/or whatever you want. If you add these extra vegetables, don’t add the mushrooms; instead, sautee them with some of the broth for about 15 minutes, until they’re shrunk and soft.</p>
<p>After 20 minutes drain the potatoes and get rid of as much water as you can. While they’re draining, heat two sticks of butter in a small pan. Add some olive oil too, to prevent burning. Once it’s melted and hot, add the rest of the onions and garlic. De-stem and chop up the remainder of the herbs and add them in too. Put the potatoes back in the pot and put it on a medium burner. Add about a cup of milk and then pour this mixture into your potatoes. Mash it all together. Add more salt and pepper, as desired.</p>
<p>Also while the potatoes are draining, chop up your broccoli and tomatoes and coat them with olive oil, herbs, salt and pepper. Put them into a steamer but don’t turn it on yet.</p>
<p>Once the uncovered pot has been in the oven for 30 minutes, remove it and turn off the oven. Carefully remove the beefs and put them into a bowl and cover. You’ll want to let them rest for 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>While the meat is resting, turn on the steamer. As soon as the broccoli turns a deeper green and the tomatoes are soft, remove them from the heat.</p>
<p>While the vegetables are steaming, get your mushrooms out of the broth using a strainer and put them into a pan. Add some red wine and broth to the pan and heat for about 5 minutes, until the sauce is reduced.</p>
<p>Put this mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. This is the gravy.</p>
<p>Slice the meat from one corner to another, against the grain. Get a huge plate and build up a nice bed of mashed potatoes. Put some of the vegetables on one side and the meat on the other. Smother with gravy. EAT IT ALL. I like to have a few fruits after the meal.</p>
<p>Suggestions welcome.</p>

<p>**<em>Edit:</strong> I forgot to note that the quote that I was credited with in the video was said by Gant.</em></p>
<p>**<em>Edit 2:</strong>You can find the recipe explanation <a href="/?p=2902">here</a> (let me know if this link doesn’t work).</em></p>

<p>A Facebook status quote from some guy I’ve never met named Alex:</p>
<p>Dear Women Everywhere: unless you have big hairy balls, lifting weights will not make you bulky any more than it will make you grow a beard. In fact, lifting weights will make you beautiful. Your strength and confidence will arouse onlookers of both sexes, and your ass will be a shining beacon of hope to women who have… not yet seen the light. And if anyone fucks with you, you can break them. So lift.</p>

  <p>Here’s a question from the other day by domjo54:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like this is a dumb question, but going back to Justin’s other post about good vs bad barbells, why are wrist injuries common on the olympic lifts when using shit BBs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>domjo54 is referencing the post I did about York Barbell products, and I commented how I power cleaned with a shitty bar at a fitness facility and “almost broke my wrists”. Bars are like beer: you can have some bars that are elegant and satisfying while using others is analogous to drinking fermented deer piss. Cheaper bars are made from a shittier cut of steel, and that’s why you’ll usually find thicker bars in a fitness facility. If the crappy piece of steel is going to have similar tensile and yield strengths to a good piece of steel, it will have to be thicker to account for its inherent weakness. Thus, bars in fitness facilities are thicker bars at 30mm and sometimes up to 32mm. It’s like Burt Reynolds wearing a <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aiHDgCOlHjI/TDnOawoGZ8I/AAAAAAAACNI/-uMSUTGevEY/s320/turdferguson.jpg">giant cowboy hat</a>: ridiculous.</p>
<p>Bars are also put together differently. Better bars have some spin so that the rotation of the plates doesn’t torque the shaft on your back or in your hands (even powerlifting bars spin for this purpose). When an experienced lifter talks about training with good or bad bars, they are usually referring to the steel’s properties and the spin. The bar I was using to power clean with was a bit thick (probably 30mm) and it barely spun. When my wrists would turn over during as I power cleaned, there was resistance to the natural wrist flexion and then extension. The resistance irritated the ligaments on the back of the wrist. The pain didn’t limit me, but it was just irritating because I can’t use my good bar that is sitting in the garage.</p>
<p>There can be other wrist injuries associated with Olympic lifting, but they are often the lifter or coach’s fault (racking a clean or snatch, jerk position, rack position in the jerk, etc.) and aren’t caused by how shitty the bar is. I had pain just from doing some easy power cleans, so I decided not to even attempt snatching since the snatch has a much faster turnover at the wrists with a greater distance traveled. There is more potential for stress on the wrists during a snatch even though less weight is used. Wrist irritation or injuries <em>during the turnover phase</em> of a snatch or a clean can occur from a bar that doesn’t spin well, and this is why Olympic lifters are particular about the quality of their bar.</p>
<p>—–</p>
<p>**<em>Edit:</strong>Kendrick Farris (85kg) will be competing tomorrow. Good luck, Kendrick.</em></p>
<p>The 2010 Olympic weightlifting World Championships are pumping out videos. I am very impressed with this video of Liao Hui (69kg) who attempted a world record in the snatch (missed it), and had a world record in the clean and jerk and the total.</p>
<p>Snatch 154, 160, 166x WR attempt</p>
<p>CJ 184, 198 WR, –</p>

<p>Every Friday we post our personal records in lifting, eating, busting through clothes, or my speedo pictures. This is done so we can show support for one another, but I like it because it keeps me updated on the regular posters of the site. If you haven’t had any PR’s of late, then you can just give an update of your training. I like that.</p>

  <p>I got an e-mail from Aaron and the subject was, “I owe you an apology”. ‘Well, it’s about time,” I thought, not knowing what he was talking about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve read all of your posts about wearing a belt while training, and each time I’ve kinda rolled my eyes like a douche-nozzle and told myself that I don’t have any need for a belt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, this past Friday (deadlift Friday, a holy day of obligation for my friends and I) my friend asked if I wanted to try out a belt, for shits and giggles. I agreed because I saw no harm in using one. Sure enough, I take my 90’s small previous 1RM of 275 and pull it for an easy 5 reps. Despite being exhausted from my previous work sets, I knew that a jump to 300 was an absolute must. I strained for several seconds as my head filled with blood, but I got that son of a bitch off the floor and all the way up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the fact that the belt was way too big and I had no prior experience with a belt, I got a 25 lb PR. As much as I hate to admit wrongdoing, you are absolutely correct about weight belts and anyone who doesn’t use one is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that since I started reading your site I’ve gained 20 lbs, increased my PR’s on every lift, AND taken 1:30 off my Marine Corps PFT run time. Increased size and strength does not always mean a slower runner.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>These are Aaron’s PFT improvements.</p>
<p>Crunches — 26 to 67</p>
<p>Pull-ups — 8 to 13</p>
<p>3 mile run — 22:30 to 21:00</p>
<p>Aaron also told me that his PFT score doesn’t do justice to his overall physical improvement, saying, “I also play club hockey for my University and my speed, endurance, and strength along the boards have all gone through the roof.” Nice job, Aaron.</p>
<p>How has strength benefited you lately?</p>
