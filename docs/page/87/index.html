  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Koklyaev#cite_note-5">Mikhail Koklyaev</a> is an impressive human being. He is crazy strong in every lift you can think of, powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting. Watch the following demonstration where he does a 270kg behind-the-neck jerk, deadlifts 400kg for a triple, does a 290kg NO HAND squat, and a 190kg snatch. Egad.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXN4Ogf3eHg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>His best snatch is 210kg and his best clean and jerk is 250kg. Those numbers would put him among the best in the world in the super heavyweight category, and if he trained the lifts exclusively he probably could win a gold medal. Look at this video of him push pressing 220kg (to clarify, that’s 484 lbs.):</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sAs02Bu1Ns?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>He also has some pretty damn good powerlifting numbers. His bests are a 365kg squat, a 240kg bench, and a 415kg deadlift — all raw. In pounds that is 803, 528, and 913! He could be a top contender in powerlifting too! Here is a video of him deadlifting 415kg:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1IVlJIMeT9M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Koklyaev is a good strongman competitor — he finished on the podium for all the IFSA World Championships and has done well at the Arnold Strongman Classic (5 finishes in the top 5) and has won a lot of Strongman Champions League in Russia. Plus, he’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/koklyaevmisha#p/u/18/BD6Hj6Llk08">got some other skills</a>. You can see more of Koklyaev’s domination of the iron at his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/koklyaevmisha">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

  <p>In the 70’s Big Workshops I go into depth on the topic of conditioning and programming it in a strength program. I always mention barbell complexes and their effectiveness regarding conditioning, especially with a person who lacks conditioning.</p>
<p>Dan John is known for his use of complexes, and they can be traced back to Istvan “Steve” Javorek’s creativity. <a href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/rebuild_yourself_with_complexes">This</a> article by John is a nice introduction to the complexes. <a href="http://staff.jccc.net/ijavorek/bookdb.html#I">Here</a> is some stuff by Javorek, and <a href="http://danjohn.net/pdfs/complex.pdf">this</a> is a list of Dan John’s favorite complexes. A barbell complex has the lifter performing multiple reps at sub-maximal weight in different exercises. An example of one of John’s complexes is doing reps (5, for example) on a bent over row, power clean, front squat, military press, back squat, and good mornings. Running through each exercise at five reps each would be considered a “set”, and you would do 3 to 5 sets of them.</p>
<p>Barbell complexes are pretty useful for a few reasons. They have the lifter performing a lot of volume in a relatively short amount of time. If you did the above complex at 8 reps each, that’s almost 50 reps on your entire body. From a conditioning standpoint, complexes use a lot of musculature and keep the muscles working for 2 to 5 minutes at a time. This creates a deficit in energy substrates, and the deficit is the stress that the body adapts to over time to get conditioned. Also, the high reps on full range of motion lifts helps maintain lean body mass when in a conditioning phase, and potentially will increase the LBM as well.</p>
<p>Gant used barbell complexes and prowler work to condition for Judo season earlier this year to great success. Even though he dropped the big lifts (he was already strong and needed to cut to 220), he actually gained a bit of muscle while dropping body fat. Gant does really well with creating conditioning programs for combative sports, so if you ever need help, he’s the guy to talk to. He made a good point to me on the phone last night. If you are doing a complex for five sets (with roughly 50 reps per set), and each set you increase the weight 10 pounds, then you increase the tonnage by a ton (2000 lbs.) throughout the workout. And that’s not even counting the tonnage you’re doing with the movements themselves. It’s not surprising that he built some muscle doing a month of barbell complexes.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/khS8lpuHYKE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>I differ from Dan John in that I don’t program barbell complexes for the sake of LBM or strength gain. Dan runs a high school weight room, so he has to have quick workouts to make progress and keep kids motivated — the logistics probably get hairy and I don’t have to worry about that. If I’m working with a person that is sedentary, de-trained, or just de-conditioned, I’ll get them strong for a few weeks and start introducing some basic conditioning where I vary up the work to rest ratio. I have used a pseudo barbell complex before, and it’s simply doing 5×5 squats, 5×5 presses, and 5×3 deadlifts at a lighter weight on the minute. This is challenging enough where the person gets a little sweaty and breathing hard, and then I once they do this a few times, I’ll make things more complicated. Generally speaking I’ll get someone strong, then use stuff like barbell complexes or interval training to start getting them conditioned.</p>
<p>Complexes are a great tool because of the higher rep volume the whole body receives. Because of this it can turn into a very effective conditioning tool. Plus it only requires the most basic gym equipment — a barbell. If you’re interested, try sticking in one of Dan John’s complexes after one of your training sessions. Start off lighter than you need to and take the rest breaks.</p>
<p>Last night I did a complex that I created. I haven’t been able to train a lot recently (lots of travel, contracting the plague, etc.) and don’t have access to a gym for a few days. I wanted some light, but thorough work on my body so that when I do get to a gym, I’m not too far behind. I also wanted to use a complex for some conditioning workout in the garage so that the Florida weather would provide extra stress. Turns out it was plenty.</p>
<p>I ended up doing five reps each of power cleans, front squats, presses, back squats, bent over rows, deadlifts, power jerks, back squats, and RDLs. I did that three times with 60kg (134 lbs.). The first set took me about 4 minutes. I rested 4 minutes in the garage (I wanted to have to recover in the heat/humidity), and the next set took me about 3.5 minutes, but I was sucking wind. Then I rested 5 or 6 minutes and finished the last set in about 4 minutes. Barely. Then I sprawled out in the A/C for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t recommend doing something like that in your first conditioning workout. I have pretty good work capacity for a lifter and I also can adapt to things pretty quickly, but it still kicked my ass. If you haven’t been doing any conditioning, then it doesn’t take much stress to induce an adaptation. It’s always better to ease into things. Since my body went through that shock, I had a headache throughout last night.</p>
<p>In order to be “in shape”, the average lifter won’t need more than one or two conditioning workouts if you plan them well. Barbell complexes are already set up so that you don’t have to do a lot of planning or tweaking. If you have wanted to add some conditioning to your program and didn’t want to do any running, give complexes a try.</p>

<p><em>Gant’s note</em>:</p>
<p>Complexes can be a good addition to any program. You can use them as assistance work, conditioning, or simply to add volume to your workout. Read the articles Justin linked and the list of Dan John’s complexes. If you must create your own, try to be reasonable. When I talked to Dan about them, he said “pass over your head once and don’t get stupid with the movements.” Can’t beat that.</p>
<p>My favorite one was Complex A for eights. I did this two ways. In one, I would work it like sets across with a five minute rest period (the minimum amount of time you get between judo matches). I can tell you now that five sets of Complex A at 60 kg will get your dander up in a big way.</p>
<p>The second way I did this was to do five sets and add weight each time, resting as necessary between sets. I worked up to 90kg, which was basically a three-minute slugfest.</p>
<p>Row x 8</p>
<p>Clean x 8</p>
<p>Front squat x 8</p>
<p>Military press x 8</p>
<p>Back squat x 8</p>
<p>Good mornings x 8</p>

  <p>One of 70’s Big’s campaigns is to get people competing in something. There are a lot of mental and introspective benefits to competing and it focuses training and makes it fun. Whether you are a grizzled veteran or just starting out, you can send in videos and I’ll actually start posting them regularly. I’ll try to dip into my e-mail archives for those of you who have already sent in videos.</p>
<p>For all you spectators, maybe you can use this as motivation. I haven’t heard of anyone having a bad time at their first meet/competition. And for all of you daily commentors, go ahead and strike up a conversation. I leave it up to you resourceful goons to incite a <del datetime="2010-08-24T04:31:44+00:00">riot</del> conversation topic.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you find things around the internet that are relevant to 70’s Big, whether they are videos, pictures or articles, then feel free to send those on in.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>Stephen Winburn is a powerlifter competing in the 220 lb. class (presumably raw?) in Georgia. He has competed against AC before, and this is a video of him pulling 555 for a triple for a 37 lb. PR. Nice.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ulob2AZkvm4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>——–</p>
<p>Duane competed in the 110kg class at the Brute Strength Stars and Stripes USAPL competition in Norfolk, VA. His total of 587.5 kg was good enough to win the weight class by a margin of 2.5kg (the same increase he made on his third attempt squat). Nice job, Duane.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUtujPE-hvI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>——–</p>
<p>And lastly, NolanPower from the comments did awesome at NJ states. He went 8/9, 1636 lbs. in the 220 lb. class — RAW. He caps the meet off with a 716 lb. third attempt deadlift. Fucking awesome.</p>

  <p>Brent is a pain in the ass, so let’s pick on him today. Here is a video of him deadlifting 405 for 8. It isn’t a limit set, but it’s tough.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3_M_Fk8abE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>On a side note, Brent was asking if he looks more swole in the picture (remember, he’s been focusing on swollertrophy as of late). I really can’t tell because he’s wearing white, the one color that reduces swoleness.</p>
<p>Irre-fucking-gardlessly, let’s talk about some mechanics. If you watch the first few reps, you can see that Brent doesn’t get a good squeeze in his chest prior to pulling. Since he doesn’t extend his thoracic spine to the potential that he can, there is some slack that gets yanked out as he starts the pull. Brent habitually does this for some reason (I noticed it on his Olympic lifts, and he was doing it in an Olympic weightlifting meet in March to deleterious effects), and I think training alone all the time is the culprit. As you can see, Brent is strong enough that the loose starting position doesn’t prevent him from pulling the bar off the ground, affect his low back, or change the bar path. This looseness can allow the bar to swing forward as it comes off the ground, and when the bar is in front of the middle of the foot (the balance point) it’ll be exponentially harder (and cause a missed lift if it’s heavy). Letting the bar swing out front also can cause the low back to round since the lever arm is less efficient.</p>
<p>As Brent gets tired, you can see his hips raise before the bar gets past his knees. Ideally the back angle shouldn’t change until after the bar passes the knees. His back angle changes (hips rising, chest dropping) because his hamstrings are getting tired. The hamstrings isometrically hold the back angle in place, and since he’s doing higher reps they are getting fatigued and not doing their job. You can clearly see this as the bar passes his knees. Brent pushes his knees forward and the bar doesn’t move upward. As a result, the hips extend without applying any force to the bar, and this makes the back more vertical. In other words, the bar doesn’t move that much and the hamstrings are no longer helping, so the lockout becomes primarily a knee and back extension without including the normal hip extension.</p>
<p>If you’re doing a 1RM, you should pull the bar however you can. But when you’re trying to get as much musculature strong (or maximally jacked), you’d want to keep your knees back so that the hamstrings maintain their role in the movement. Brent isn’t horribly sloppy here, but if he were, there would be significant stress on the lumbar spine. If you already have back problems then you’d want to be careful with this common form fault. I’ve coached lots of people that have lumbar disc problems and they have never re-injured the existing injury. However, I’ve heard several stories recently of people hurting their backs deadlifting, and this form issue is probably the problem. Any time you change a movement mid-lift to use less muscle mass, you’ll increase the injury potential.</p>
<p>A coach should take care of your form faults, but if you don’t have one, a friend or camera can identify your problems. You <em>should</em> have already learned enough about the movement that you would be able to see major errors. Once they are identified, you can cue yourself. At most you’ll think about one or two cues. In Brent’s case, I would verbally cue him to squeeze his chest up before the lift starts. This would fix his little “hips raising” issue as well as the “pulling the slack out” issue. Since 405 is relatively lighter for him, his lack of tightness isn’t detrimental, but he looks like a poon doing it. Next, I would cue his knees to stay back on the second portion of the pull. This will prevent his knees from falling forward and will keep his hamstrings tight, thus giving him a wonderful set of hams that will create the road map for a woman’s eyes to travel up to his prominent glutes he got from FedEx and squatting.</p>
<p>Next I would cue him to do pull-ups in his underwear.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/kM9IvZjITY8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Brent’s roommate does a fantastic job of giving him adamantly loud, yet non-descriptive cues.</p>

  <p><strong>PR FRIDAY – post all KINDS of personal records to the comments, yo.</strong></p>
<p>I played football throughout high school like most guys (that’s American football for you Euro readers), and I played a year in college. The sport of football fits well with this whole attitude thing that 70’s Big has grown into. One player exudes this attitude into the way he plays, and that player is Brett Favre.</p>
<p>Favre is a tough quarterback, likes to compete, comes through in the clutch, and has fun doing it. He’s started over 300 games consecutively — an insane feat that is probably one of the most impressive sport statistics ever. Oh, and he’s coming back for a 20th year.</p>

    Favre seen here NOT wearing under armor

<p>This isn’t news to anyone who casually follows football or the NFL. The sports “media” (code for “annoying bunch of pains in the asses”) have been talking non-stop about whether or not he was going to retire or not because of his surgically repaired ankle. Without any evidence of whether or not he would retire, that maintained priority over most sport networks. I remember seeing the dorky guy with the mustache on ESPN talking to Favre as he sat in his giant diesel truck. The guy was all, “This humidity is making my makeup smear. Do you think there are any scones left in the media van?” and Brett was all, “I’m gonna go edge my lawn and drink a few beers.”</p>
<p>Three weeks ago I predicted that Favre would play this season and he was essentially skipping training camp on purpose. And you know what? I don’t give a damn. He <em>should</em> skip training camp. Why would you want a 40 year old guy having multiple practices a day, stressing his body (that can’t accept the same stress it did five, ten, fifteen, or twenty years ago), adding to his year’s work load when you want him to still make an impact in late January? It’s physiology, folks.</p>
<p>Too much stress would weaken Favre throughout the season. Take into account the ankle surgery — that is another structure in his body that shouldn’t be stressed more than necessary. Guys who have been in the league for 12 or 15 years shouldn’t have to worry about training camp so that they can actually be effective during the season instead of burning out. And don’t try and pull that shit that he “plays quarterback” and the QB doesn’t go through a whole lot of physical trauma. Favre gets his ass kicked on a regular basis, but he gets back up and continues slinging the ball down field. That’s 70’s Big.</p>
<p>I’m rooting for Favre and the Vikings this season. I’m a Browns fan, but we all know how that is gonna end. We’ll be talking about football more, probably about once a week when the season gets underway. It’s a sport that is pretty relevant for us since it involves above average strength, power, speed, and conditioning. Irregardlessly, (a term that is used specifically to troll you) most of us will be talking about it anyway.</p>

  <p>Training logs are important for several reasons. Keeping a long term log shows the lifter how much progress they have made over time. It also gives immediate input on the last few workouts specifically the warm up strategy and what the last work sets were. They also give the lifter an opportunity to add in useful comments like, “maximum jackage occurred today” or “it’s like I’m on fucking D-bol”.</p>
<p>A tangible training log that can be carried to the gym will be most effective since there is the potential of not remembering everything that previously occurred. It also allows instant emotions to be dictated to the log, such as, “my traps are mos def gettin’ their SWOLE on”.</p>
<p>Aside from warm-up sets, work sets, and awesome comments, there are some additional metrics that are beneficial to record. These ancillary metrics are optional, but they give a measure of how the body feels in a training program. If the lifter consistently records how they are feeling prior to training, over time they may observe that they became overtrained. There’s a difference in recording, “I’m tired” and “I wanna beat ’em!”</p>
<p>The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale can also be utilized for individual exercises. In such a case, if a 1 rep max (1RM) is known, then it will be considered a ’10’ on the RPE. There should be nothing left after a 10 rated lift, and if the bar path is deviated to the smallest degree, the lift will end in failure. If a lifter doesn’t want to deal with numbers, they can just use subjective terms, such as Brent’s “ez pz” for a set that is, oddly enough, “easy”. I remember recording “Very. Fucking. Hard.” after doing heavy sets of squats. If there is a gauge on heavier lifts, then the lifter will know how difficult they were months later when they are figuring out how well they adapted to their program, given the circumstances.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, other circumstances would include food, sleep, stress, time management issues – basically anything that would deter training from occurring as normal. I typically reserve comments on these issues if something is askew because there isn’t much of a point in saying, “No stress in life today, aside from Brent trolling the fuck out of me.”</p>
<p>If you haven’t been keeping a log because you’re lazy, then it’d be good to start doing so. Even if you aren’t following a strict program, having a log and being able to review your non-program will still be descriptive in letting you know what has been working or what hasn’t been working. Besides, if you don’t know what you’ve been doing, then you can’t figure out what you’ve been doing wrong when the shit hits the fan.</p>
<p>Here is a page out of my log to give you an idea of how it is structured and how I annotate different things. It is from earlier this year when I was working on rehabbing my back and regaining strength.</p>

<p>There is an IPF survey going around that could potentially affect the bench, squat, refeering, weight class changes, age categories, and more. If you give a damn about powerlifting under IPF ruling (like if you compete in USAPL), then go take the survey.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JTHYB7X">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JTHYB7X</a></p>
<p>Personally I think the survey is a little vague, but oh well.</p>

  <p>Edit: I didn’t preview the post and the formatting was all jacked up. Woops. I’ll put the blame on what is apparently the flu that I came down with yesterday.</p>
<p>I get a lot of e-mails from guys that are in the service, and they usually have some unique circumstances. Some times guys want to get stronger while keeping their bodyweight in check because of annoying regulations. Some times they need to get ideas on programs that don’t have access to a typical training facility. Other times they just want to get bigger and stronger and have the room to grow. In any case, it’s always a pleasure to help them (I enjoy helping people in general).</p>
<p>I got an awesome e-mail recently from a Captain in Afghanistan. It was deadlift day for the group of lifters that includes some “runners that have been converted over to lifting”. You have to admire their intensity — they don’t fuck around.</p>

    AC closes his eyes and misses a third attempt squat forward.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Something is bound to go wrong. You’re going to miss a rep because you let the bar drift forward as you pulled it off the floor. You might (for whatever reason) close your eyes (followed by a forward somersault) and miss a heavy squat. At some point you won’t finish your pull and miss a clean or snatch. And you will sure as hell miss a heavy press forward. Whatever it might be, something is going to go wrong; you aren’t perfect all the time.</p>
<p>Some people can’t come to terms with this reality. They’ll get frustrated when learning a new movement and try to quit. Some pout and moan when they miss a lift and others don’t understand why they sucked on a given day. Others will look in the mirror and say, “My traps aren’t big enough.”</p>
<p>Irregardlessly, you’ll face these events and it’s up to you to decide whether or not you’re going to act like a sally when they do. When things go wrong, you (and your coach, if applicable) need to figure out what went wrong so that it doesn’t happen again. If you can manage to learn from your mistakes, then you’ll inevitably improve.</p>

    The bar isn't supposed to hit your chin
  </p>
</div>
<p>Mistakes can be mechanical in nature. Letting your knees drift in as you hit the bottom of your squat will cause them to also shift forward at the bottom which also brings your pelvis forward. Heavy deadlifts have a tendency to drift forward if you don’t pull it back, and this makes them exponentially harder. Hitting low on a snatch will help you miss it forward. Catching a clean in the same way will make the front squat much harder. Basically if you do something that moves the bar forward or backward of the middle of your foot, the lift is going to be extremely difficult, and there are lots of reasons that can make this happen on every barbell lift.</p>
<p>Problems can also occur from a macro standpoint: programming and recovery. Recovery limitations are either your fault or out of your control. It’s your fault if you didn’t eat enough protein and calories, but having a three day shoot out as a SWAT team member with little sleep is a function of your job. In either case, care must be taken when training to account for these things.</p>

    Brent percieves his lack of trap development as failure
  </p>
</div>
<p>Programming problems can arise when someone is not ready for their program, advancing beyond their program, has long-term recovery issues, experiences nagging or acute injuries, or has too much volume/intensity causing too much stress in the current program. This is where you have to be particularly observant to look for patterns in your training and this is the chief reason why keeping a training log is important and necessary. As you advance and get stronger the closer you will have to pay attention to this. If you’re deadlifting too frequently, you’ll get run down and it will affect your squats and pulls. If you’re doing too much volume early in the week, then your intensity day will not thrive because you won’t fully recover. If you’re hamstrings aren’t used to handling heavy loads when they are tired, then deadlifting in a long meet is going to be arduous. When you cause local stress on structures (particularly muscles, tendons, and ligaments) and you have chronically high systemic stress, the structures won’t heal efficiently and are more prone to injury (which is why people get hurt from frequent CrossFit training). It’s all cumulative.</p>
<p>Younger lifters will some times feel helpless because of failure. Older lifters understand failure and most will learn from it. I know some people that have gotten strong because of their persistence over years and years of training, and it wouldn’t be possible without learning from their failure.</p>
<p>Looking for patterns is a concept that Pete Blaber repeats in his interesting book, The Mission, The Men, and Me. If you’re observant over time you’ll be able to absorb enough data to recognize patterns that can help you figure out what went wrong. When you figure out what went wrong, you’ll be able to fix it and improve. It’s okay to fuck up. Just don’t keep doing it.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Edit:</strong></em> There is a t-shirt poll on the left side bar.</p>
<p>The ten day California journey is over. We drove to Sacramento on Friday and met up with Ben Claridad, a strong and funny Olympic weightlifter (that means he gets along fine with us). Ben, AC, and I trained at Camilo Gutierrez’s Midtown Strength and Conditioning that evening. Camilo is a real nice guy and has a pretty sweet facility that is home to some strong geared powerlifters and other strength/power athletes. After training we ate some pizza and basically had a sleep over at Ben’s where I watched AC and Ben play some videogames.</p>
<p>The next morning Ian Carver of CF Centurion hosted the last 70’s Big Workshop of our Cali tour. Ian is a law enforcement officer and, according to his wife, is “old”. In any case, they have a beautiful family and we had a lot of fun at their facility. There were almost 25 people at the workshop including 7 or 8 women who could be our spokes model on why women who train are wonderfully in shape and attractive.</p>
<p>After the workshop, we had Chipotle burritos, beer, and did some coaching for some of the people that hung around till 8:00 PM or so. AC and I drove to the Sacramento airport, dropped the rental car off, got to our terminal, and boarded the red eye flight to Charlotte. I didn’t sleep at all on this flight and felt like I was in hell when I sat there with everyone asleep around me, had nothing to do, and couldn’t get in any kind of comfortable position. I slept on the hopper flight to Atlanta for about an hour.</p>
<p>When I finally got back to my mom’s house outside of Atlanta, I was smelly and exhausted and slept for a few hours, then fell asleep by 7:00 PM and didn’t wake up until this morning (hence the late post). In any case, it was a good cap to the excellent trip where we met and hung out with lots of great people, trained a bit, and hopefully gave everyone a good show. Here are some random pictures from my phone.</p>

  <p>Justin’s still on his trip, and I’ve watched the sunrise from my office desk twice this week, so sorry for the lack of posts. That needn’t stop you from posting your record exploits this week. Lifting, eating, or pillaging. Let’s have it.</p>
<p>Hopefully a lot of you are going to participate in the Super Total Challenge. I’m doing mine this weekend. Choose your attempts wisely…maybe two per lift. I suspect that my deadlift will take at least a 60 pound hit by the time I get there.</p>
<p>Since we’ve already phoned it in the rest of the week, I’ll leave you with someone else’s work. These are a random selection of articles from sites you may not read that contain some good info AKA five bookmarks I can post about in five minutes before getting back to work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chaosandpain.com/content/vegetarianism-and-veganism-are-logical-poopie-flavored-lollipop">Vegetarianism and Veganism Are As Logical As a Poopie-Flavored Lollipop</a></p>
<p>This is an article about vegetarians from ChAoS &amp; PAIN. He’s a smart guy that writes a good training blog. He reminds me of myself when I was younger (goes hard, doesn’t care for rest, pushes it to the max every damn time), but he’s a hell of a lot more outspoken.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chaosandpain.com/content/just-because-you-have-vagina%E2%80%A6">Just Because You Have a Vagina…</a></p>
<p>This one is for the ladies or the post-op trannies among us. C&amp;P drops some good knowledge about how women should train.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/rebuild_yourself_with_complexes&amp;cr=">Rebuild Yourself with Complexes</a></p>
<p>This is from Dan John, the man who corrected my KB swing before I even got my first one to chest height. It’s hard to pick out one article from the DJ universe, but I chose this one because it made a significant impact on my training. This spring, I ditched a lot of my old training stuff to get in shape for spring judo. I replaced all of my conditioning (other than mat work) with barbell complexes and prowler work. I got more muscular (from the time under tension), leaner (duh), and in better condition than I have been in a long time. I won the three big spring tourneys in the masters expert division, my best result in years. This article helped me towards that goal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irongarmx.net/Articles/7_minute_rotator_cuff_solution.pdf">7 minute rotator cuff solution</a></p>
<p>A concise prehab and rehab routine for the cuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.defrancostraining.com/ask_joe/archives/ask_joe_08-10-03.html">DeFranco’s Agile 8</a></p>
<p>The solution to hip mobility problems.</p>
<p>Of course it wouldn’t be a 70sBig post if we didn’t embed a video. Here’s a typical bowl of meat for me at Genghis Grill. It’s not a PR, but it’s a good portion. If your bowl doesn’t look like this, you need to rethink your strategy.</p>
