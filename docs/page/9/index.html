  <p>On 22 September 2009 this website launched in order to educate people about strength and conditioning as well as entertain. The focus was on being big, muscular, and strong in a time dominated by emaciation. Women were encouraged to train, men were encouraged to pound the calories, and everyone was pushed into competition.</p>
<p>Over the years the site has evolved due to a combination of getting jaded with the same kindergarten material available across the “training-sphere” as well as an obligation to not only teach people to get strong, but to keep them healthy and strong through life. We should all aim to train our bodies, minds, and souls deep into old age. The basic tenants of 70sBig.com remain the same:</p>
<p>– commit to training with reckless intensity</p>
<p>– develop a physique built with performance instead of vanity</p>
<p>– help encourage others in their training</p>
<p>– enter competition for ultimate introspection</p>
<p>– teach and learn about strength and conditioning, mobility, nutrition, anatomy, physiology, fitness, etc.</p>
<p>– tirelessly lead the charge to end misconceptions about females and lifting</p>
<p>– <a href="/blog/2012/09/the-revolutionary-guide-to-manly-short-shorts/" target="_blank">actively work towards changing societal body image</a></p>
<p>– have a damn good time doing it</p>

<p>It’s always been my intention to help people through 70sBig.com. I hope whoever you are, whether you’ve been here since day one or just started reading yesterday, you have gained benefit from this website’s five years of information. When I find the time, I regularly work to improve our knowledge and synthesize material you can implement into your own training and life.</p>
<p>**This wouldn’t be possible without all of you. **I want to thank all of the readers, new and old. I consider you a part of the 70’s Big Community, one full of crazy assholes who are some of the nicest, hard working, and amusing folks around. The reach of 70’s Big is broad, and it’s comforting to know that we can go almost anywhere in the world, talk about 70’s Big and immediately have a bond with a stranger. “70’s Big takes care of their own,” is a comforting thought. We’ve built something really cool here and this is as much your birthday as it is mine.</p>
<p>To all of my friends around the world — whether I’ve met you or not, held a seminar in your gym, trained with you, or lectured to your unit — thanks for making this fun. And to my close friends who were integral in the creation of this website: thanks for being there for me with your absurd, unique, and loyal personality.</p>
<p>The future is always bright to people who attack it with fervor. 70’s Big will always be around to educate, entertain, and irritate you. The idea of communicating with all of you assholes through old age will, at the very least, be entertaining.</p>
<p>Train hard, get big. Get 70’s Big.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday</p>
<p> </p>

  <p>Need some calories? Protein? Want to satisfy that sweet tooth but keep the food items pretty clean? Here’s what you’re gonna do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put 1 to 3 tablespoons of a nut butter in a bowl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a small amount of butter (grass fed is ideal).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microwave it for 30 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put a scoop of protein in. Stir it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add in goodies for flavoring (cocoa powder, cinnamon, vanilla extract, etc.) or consistency (almond milk).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consume.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/tJWUS3xKQH/embed/" width="409" height="471" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<p>Some people call this protein cookie dough. Some call it protein cake batter. I just call it a good time. Two tablespoons of most nut butters will yield around 16g of fat, 7g of carbs, and 7g of protein. Protein scoops will range from 20 to 28g (the latter is whey isolate). Add in a little extra fat from the butter (1/2 a tablespoon is about 5g). You end up with about 20g of fat, 30g of protein, and less than 10g of carbs for about 330 calories.</p>
<p>I consider all of these food items acceptable in my <a href="/books/pale-for-lifters/" target="_blank"><em>Paleo for Lifters</em></a> approach. The only issue would be what kind of fat you’re getting from the nut butter, but if you’re training hard, otherwise eating clean, and still consuming some fish oil, I don’t think it’s a big deal. And, as my wife proved to me over the weekend, you can put almonds in a food processor and make almond butter, so other than the protein powder and whatever you use to liquify the mixture, there doesn’t have to be any not-clean ingredients.</p>
<p>I don’t drink milk, so slamming a glass of almond milk after eating this was particularly satisfying.</p>
<p>Dark chocolate almond butter works really well, but you could use regular almond or peanut butter. You could throw a square of dark chocolate in or add/subtract things like vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa, and and almond milk for different effects. You could probably solidify it in the fridge, or drizzle it on bananas or strawberries. If you eat oatmeal, it’d probably mix pretty well in there.</p>
<p>It’s pretty caloric dense, so if you’re trying to lose body fat it may not be ideal. But then again, it might be better than engulfing a pint of Ben and Jerry’s. If you were short on time, this is something you could make really quick and store in a small tupperware for the next day. Add a high density carb and it might be pretty good to take on a trail (assuming you’re at an altitude and work rate that can tolerate fat). Otherwise, enjoy this caloric dense snack.</p>

<p>**Recap: **Monday was the <a href="/blog/2014/09/chalk-talk-8/" target="_blank">8th Chalk Talk episode</a> about using speed deadlifts and RDLs in training, particularly during deployments, competitive seasons, or otherwise stressful training to still get decent posterior chain work in. <a href="/blog/2014/09/the-feast/" target="_blank">Learning how to feast</a> was the focal point of Wednesday, so don’t miss that article. I was away for a bit, so I couldn’t fix the broken podcast link from earlier in the month, but <a href="/blog/2014/09/70s-big-radio-episode-19/" target="_blank">Episode 19 of 70’s Big Radio</a> is now up. It features an interview with physical therapist Dr. Rob Andrade. Lastly, the <a href="/blog/2013/08/testosterone-and-pwo-nutrition/" target="_blank">throwback article</a> of the week is from a year ago and explains why your post workout meal doesn’t really mean much.</p>
<p>The following video details an Olympic weightlifting battle. Weightlifting is a bit friendlier to spectators because opposing lifters are usually following each other’s attempts. In contrast, powerlifting has the entire flight lift one attempt before continuing onto the next. The structure of powerlifting means you have to already know what’s going on to see the battles. The same goes for weightlifting, but it happens at a faster pace. This video clues you into the battle through narration:</p>

  <p>The premise of my nutrition philosophy is quality, non-inflammatory foods in appropriate macros to fuel performance. Improved body composition is a resultant or secondary goal. I use the Paleo Diet as a foundation; it is predicated on eliminating harmful foods from the diet as well as putting an emphasis on real food instead of edible processed items. Improving food quality will drop body fat off of people, but the uber Paleo approach is low on carbs.</p>
<p>The obvious solution — and I am baffled as to why people don’t intuitively do this — is to eat more carbs. In <strong><a href="/books/pale-for-lifters/" target="_blank">Paleo for Lifters</a></strong> I use potatoes as a primary source of carbohydrates as they are not a gut irritant and few things sound more manly than “meat and potatoes”.</p>
<p>It’s pretty simple: meat and potatoes, vegetables, fruit, and lots of quality fat. You can lift and train hard on this eating method. You can improve your health metrics like blood lipid profiles and blood pressure on this diet. Sometimes, you can even feast on this diet.</p>
<p>**What is a feast? **</p>
<p>A feast is an event in a man’s life when he consumes a significant amount of food. Feasts are inherently at least 1.5 pounds of food; anything less is merely a meal. Feasts are memorable because of their sheer quantity, taste, or complexity. A feast should be so special, you can look back at it and say, “Remember that feast?” Everyone around you will stare with an unfocused gaze and nod their heads, “Yeah, I remember…”</p>
<p>Below is a modest feast.</p>
<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/tBgQ_uxKZl/embed/" width="362" height="416" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<p>**Is food quality a concern? **</p>
<p>It depends. In _Paleo for Lifters _I give specific instructions to different population types. Are you fat and need to lose it? Are you skinny and need to gain muscle? Are you low body fat but could gain some weight? These scenarios will dictate the feast.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible to have a <em>Paleo for Lifters</em> feast. Grill a few pounds of steak, a few rack of ribs, or a pork loin (or all three), throw in some taters with butter and go to town. But usually those feasts aren’t as fun.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned with health or body fat, then tighten your feast’s shot group. If you just want to have a sit down with the boys and feast your god damn eyes out, then make it official: have a feast.</p>
<p>**How to feast? **</p>
<p>Feasts can be impromptu or planned, yet they need to be at least 1.5 pounds of food, preferably more. The only necessary ingredient for a feast is meat; a feast without meat is no different than your front lawn. You wouldn’t eat your lawn for half an hour, would you?</p>
<p>Make conditions as perfect as possible. Cook or grill it your favorite way. Get your favorite sauces, spices, or beverage. Ideally you should make it a group event. Men who feast in groups are happier, have higher T levels, and have bigger biceps.</p>
<p>You have two approaches to the feast: <em><strong>The Crush Method</strong></em> or <em><strong>The Marathon Method.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="/2014/09/SSlam1988Warrior.gif"><img data-attachment-id="10368" data-permalink="/blog/2014/09/the-feast/sslam1988warrior/" data-orig-file="/2014/09/SSlam1988Warrior.gif" data-orig-size="321,180" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SSlam1988Warrior" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2014/09/SSlam1988Warrior-200x112.gif" data-large-file="/2014/09/SSlam1988Warrior.gif" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10368" src="/2014/09/SSlam1988Warrior.gif" alt="SSlam1988Warrior" width="321" height="180" /></a>The Crush Method</em></strong> – This is when you sit down, stare at your food for a fleeting, poetic moment, and then feast in the same manner that the Ultimate Warrior shakes the ropes. If you’re going for pure volume or you’re really hungry, this method is ideal.</p>
<p>My friend Jeremy (owner of CrossFit Annandale) has a Brazilian Mastiff who weighs at least 165 pounds. His name is Cane, and he “crushes” on a regular basis. Cane knows no other method. Jeremy gives him three or four chicken thighs, and Cane crushes. He snaps the bones and nearly swallows the chicken hole. We can all learn from Cane’s crushing ability.</p>
<p>_<strong>The Marathon Method</strong> – _Choose this method when in a large gathering. Barbecues, weddings, or reunions aren’t necessarily the time and place for The Crush Method. Instead, stay uncomfortably full throughout a day. Sample everything. Eat as many animals as possible (preferably already dead and cooked). Be merry. And if someone looks at you questionably, look at the women around you and shout, “OUR DIET STARTS TOMORROW! AM I RIGHT, GIRLS?”</p>
<p><strong>The Meat Sweats</strong></p>
<p>At some point in your feasting, you may notice a phenomenon known as “the meat sweats”. In the absence of dysfunctional kidneys, don’t let this deter you. It’s merely your body’s excited way of saying, “Yes! You’re doing it! Keep going!”</p>
<p>One of the guy’s I’ve trained returned home from a special operations selection. After several weeks of limited food intake, he had a hankering for a feast. He went to Krystal’s and ordered — and feasted upon — 24 Krystal burgers. He reported meat sweats so significant, it was dripping off his nose during the feast.</p>
<p>24 Krystal burgers may sound disgusting — because it is — but it’s an impressive feast.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is what this is all about. Do something impressive. Do something memorable. Have a feast.</p>

  <p><a href="/blog/2014/09/flexible-training-programs/" target="_blank">In a recent post</a> by my Australian SOF buddy, Shaun Trainor, he reminded me that I recommended he do speed deadlifts and RDL’s while he was deployed in lieu of heavy deadlifts. In a program or circumstance that can’t tolerate the systemic depression or local soreness associated with heavy deadlifts, using speed deadlifts with posterior chain work will still get explosive work with the posterior chain. When Shaun returned home, he was able to jump back up to his previous deadlift numbers fairly quick.</p>
<p>Speed deadlifts can be alternated every week with heavy deadlifts, as they are in a few of my Texas Method templates, or they can be done every week to maintain some deadlift work without getting beat down. Not to mention you can accumulate some decent volume with doubles or triples on deadlift to develop a jacked back.</p>
<p>If you watch until the end of the video, you’ll see an explanation of NOT leaning back at the top of a deadlift. It’s a common fault that is incredibly injurious, looks ugly, and makes someone look inexperienced with anatomy or lifting. Simply lift the chest to ensure a neutral spine; don’t lean back.</p>

<p>Here’s a sweet video of AC hitting a PR double at the time of 600×2. You see his warm-up sets and then the final set where he loses his god damn shit. AC is, how do you say…more of an emotional lifter. He uses a big adrenaline dump prior to lifting and gets pumped when he hits his lifts in training and meets.</p>

  <p>Low back pain? Sacro-iliac problems? Chances are you have jacked up muscles as opposed to disc or S/I joint issues. Enter QLGM into your vernacular, and it stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratus_lumborum_muscle" target="_blank">quadratus lumborum</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteus_medius_muscle" target="_blank">glute medius</a>. These are the muscles you should focus on if you have low back, sacral, and rear pelvic pain.</p>
<p>The quadratus lumborum (kwa-DRAY-tus lum-BOR-um) connects from the bottom rib and sides of the vertebrae (specifically the transverse processes) to the top of the pelvis on both sides. This muscles laterally flexes the trunk, but it mostly functions as a stabilizer and supports the entire upper body. Since it attaches on the rim of the pelvis, tension in the QL will pull up on the pelvis. The more tension there is on the pelvis or sacrum, the more pain there can be. The video shows how to do some soft tissue work on the QL to relieve tension.</p>
<p>The glute medius attaches from the outside rim of the pelvis to upper thigh bone (specifically the greater trochanter of the femur). When you take a step with your right foot, the left glute medius holds the pelvis in place by supporting the entire body weight. Because of the leverage, it handles a force around twice body weight, so it’s working really hard just when you’re walking. Things like walking with a load, running, or lifting can tighten it up…so everything we do. The video shows how to identify the GM as well as the glute minimus (which has similar function to the GM) and some soft tissue work you can do to address it.</p>

Shaun spent 12 years in the Australian military with the last half of it in 2nd Commando Regiment, a special operations unit. _</p>
<p>The subject of Justin’s recent post (<a href="70sbig.com/blog/2014/08/category-programming" target="_blank">Category Programming</a>) on training around an erratic schedule is one that is near and dear to my heart. One of the things that used to frustrate me when I was trying to design a training program was that almost everything out there has a weekly structure. Obviously that makes sense for the majority of people, because they have a Monday-to-Friday job, but it makes it difficult for those of us who work in the military, law enforcement, or emergency services.</p>
<p>I spent 12 years in the Australian military; the last 6 in SOF. Obviously this was a job that required a high level of physical preparedness, but it was also a job that at times made it extremely difficult to train effectively. On any given day I was doing anything from hanging around the office, drinking coffee, to climbing a caving ladder up the side of a ship with 90lbs of gear strapped to me.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>Say I’m running a basic Texas Method and Friday is my squat intensity day. But what happens if I spent Thurday night in an exercise that involved clearing a 30 story office building until 4AM? How do you think my squats are going to go?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that I take the session off, or just go really light, and it’s no big deal. Everybody has life interfere with their training. However not everybody works an unpredictable schedule that may involve intense physical demands for a week or two on end. There is only so much that this can happen before the whole effect of the program starts to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Military personnel – especially those deployed in combat roles – as well as Police, Fire &amp; Rescue, and paramedics can all been dicked around so much as to make a weekly program almost unworkable. This was certainly my experience.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Template</strong></p>
<p>After spending quite some time struggling to implement a normal strength training program as an operator, I then tried a template solution. I determined what sessions I wanted to do in a standard week, and then shuffled them around week to week to fit what was going on. For example, you might decide that you were going to squat twice, deadlift once, press once and bench once. You can then decide what you’re going to do each day, depending on what’s going on with work/life.</p>
<p>This worked a little better than trying to stick to a weekly program, but I didn’t love it. Depending on how busy my week was, I’d often get behind my allocated sessions. If the disruption last more than a few days – as it often would – then the template didn’t work very well.</p>
<p><strong>Rotation system</strong></p>
<p>After that I tried a much more basic approach. I realised that any sort of weekly program wasn’t going to work for me when my job was busy, or when I was deployed. There’s too many variables when you’re overseas, and you often don’t know about a mission until a day before. Detailed planning in these sort of situations doesn’t work very well.</p>
<p>I tried a much more basic solution: <strong>a Rotation System</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Squat</li>
<li>Deadlift</li>
<li>Press</li>
</ol>
<p>Each training session, I would hit one of the lifts. The next session, whenever that was, I would move on to the next lift in the order. The order is designed so that you can still hit the sessions back to back if you’re lucky enough to get three days in a row to train.</p>
<p>No matter how much (or little) you’re getting to train, your work is balanced between the main lifts.</p>

<p>**Rep Scheme **</p>
<p>The rep scheme for the day is down to you, but considering this is a very basic program I usually run a 3×5 or 5×5. There isn’t a great need for complex rep schemes because this isn’t a long-term solution; it’s just something that’s designed to keep you ticking when work is sucking donkey dick. If you want some higher intensity you could work up to a heavy triple then drop down and hit a 3×5.</p>
<p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p>
<p>Depending on how physically demanding your last few days have been, you can either add in some assistance work or simply leave it there. If you’re beat up and tired, then at least you got some squats in. If it’s been an easy day or two, then you might throw in 1-2 accessory exercises. Keep the total number of sets at six or under for your accessories. The whole reason you’re doing this type of skeleton program is because training isn’t your main focus at the moment. If you’re overseas or on shift for Law Enforcement, then you don’t want to cripple yourself with assistance exercises because you don’t know what the coming days will bring.</p>
<p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p>
<p>Conditioning is going to be driven by context. Some people will be able to let this slide for a few weeks without much hassle, others will need to keep up regular conditioning as well as their lifting. I fall more into the former catagory, but if you are in the latter then at least keep it either very short or very long. Either do something like a single Tabata or a few Prowler sprints, or go for a long, easy run. Don’t get sucked into doing the 10-30min ‘mess you up’ CrossFit type workouts.</p>
<p><strong>Bench</strong> <strong>Press</strong></p>
<p>I’m sure there are people who are already agitated about the lack of bench in the rotation. If you want to keep benching during this, you have two options. You can alternate press days with bench days, so that every second time you get to a press day you bench press instead. That’s what I personally did. The other option is to include it after you press. If you take this option then I wouldn’t press more than a 3×5.</p>
<p><strong>Deadlift</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not you deadlift is going to depend on your specific situation. If you’re overseas and you might have jobs coming up, or if you’re wearing armour all day – on a CQB course, for example – then you probably don’t want to pull heavy. A couple of times I went out on missions with sore legs. It sucked a little bit, but it wasn’t terrible. I only did it once with bad DOMS in my lower back, and it was not a fun night. Trying to clear compounds in Helmand with my back blowing up wasn’t a good idea. However if you don’t need the same level of readiness at a moment’s notice, then there isn’t a problem deadlifting as usual.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to do heavy deads then you’ll need some other sort of posterior-chain exercise. RDLs and good mornings are an obvious choice. While power cleans aren’t a bad option you’ll probably need to still do RDLs as well.</p>
<p>Speed and banded deadlifts work well to keep your numbers up without having to pull heavy weights. If you’re going to do speed deads, avoid the temptation to start putting more and more weight on the bar until suddenly it’s a heavy triple.</p>
<p>I spent another six months in Afghanistan last year, and on Justin’s advice the majority of my deadlift days consisted of RDL 5×6, followed by 3×15 banded good mornings. It let me bring up my posterior-chain without the sort of fatigue that deadlifts can bring. When I got back to Australia my deadlift bounced back to where it was before pretty easily.</p>
<p><strong>Short-term Solution</strong></p>
<p>Is a rotation system the perfect training program? Absolutely not. It’s designed to be used when work or life prevents you from using something better. It was my answer to the unpredictable and arduous nature of my profession. It should keep you ticking over, and split your work between the main lifts in a simple to program fashion.</p>
<p>Since my last trip I’ve retired from active duty and opened my own S&amp;C facility (<a href="http://projectwarrior.com.au/" target="_blank">Project Warrior</a>). I use a variation of this with any of our new lifters that we get who can’t, for whatever reason, commit to a weekly program.</p>

<p>**Recap: **On Monday there was the first 70’s Big Radio podcast in a while, and it was an <a href="/blog/2014/09/70s-big-radio-episode-19/" target="_blank">interview with Dr. Rob Andrade</a>, physical therapist and smoked meat extraordinaire (it’s up to you to decide if that’s a metaphor). <a href="/blog/2014/09/chalk-talk-6/" target="_blank">Chalk Talk #6</a> shows how waiter’s walks can be used for shoulder prehab/rehab.</p>
<p>Below is a sweet motivational pic of Chris deadlifting at a national meet a few years ago. What kind of external stimuli motivates you? Videos? Pictures? Songs? What gets you fucking amped to train?</p>
