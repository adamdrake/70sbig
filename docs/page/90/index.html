  <h2 id="usapl-raw-nationals">USAPL Raw Nationals</h2>
<p>My group of friends that are involved in this website are competing at <a href="http://www.rmlccolorado.com/rawnats/rawnats-index.htm">USAPL Raw Nationals</a> in Denver this weekend. The five us will be flying there tomorrow from different locations. I’ll be flying from Panama City, Florida where I recently moved to, AC will be flying out of Georgia (he goes to school at Georgia Southern and his family lives outside of Atlanta, and Chris, Mike and Brent will be flying out of Dallas (Mike and Chris are coming from Wichita Falls and Brent lives north of Dallas). There shouldn’t be any confusion as to where any of us live now.</p>

<p>Raw lifting in the USAPL is relatively new, and in order to qualify for nationals you simply have to total as a raw lifter in a USAPL meet. USAPL is prevalent for its “low end gear” competitions since it resides under the International Powerlifting Federation’s (IPF) ruling. None of the aforementioned lifters are interested in competing in gear, and it isn’t something I’m interested in doing or coaching either. We may look for a new federation in the near future, but as of right now we’re just focusing on this weekend.</p>
<p>Belligerent Brent will be competing in the 82.5 kg class and will lift at 9:00 AM on Saturday. He’s the only one of us that will be lifting on Saturday. I imagine there won’t be any hi-jinks on Saturday since AC (100kg, 9:00 AM), Mike and Chris (110kg and 125kg, both at 2:00 PM) all lift on Sunday. I’ll be coaching them in their sessions, and it will be a lot more easy going than the Texas State Meet was (<a href="http://www.usapltexas.org/2009/09/2010TexasStatePowerliftingChampionships.pdf">results</a> and <a href="/?p=1613">write up</a>).</p>
<p>Don’t fret, though; we’ll have cameras rolling and AC will be directing. There were some folks that didn’t know I was in Peoria for USA Weightlifting Senior Nationals and would have come had I mentioned it, so you guys are welcome to attend and cheer them on. All of my friends are young and pretty strong and should do decently at the meet.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.rmlccolorado.com/rawnats/images/raw%20nats%20roster.pdf">Roster</a> and <a href="http://www.rmlccolorado.com/rawnats/rawnats-schedule.htm">Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll be posting our progress on the 70’s Big <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/70s-Big/377258928677">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/70sbig">Twitter</a> pages.</p>
<p>———–</p>
<h2 id="new-stuff">New Stuff</h2>
<p>And since I’m announcing things, I’ll direct your attention to the schedule for the <strong>70’s Big Workshops</strong> on the <a href="/?page_id=1415">Service</a>s page. AC and I will road trip through California in early August. There are two workshops during the weekend of August 7th near L.A. and Monterey, and we’ll help out with some coaching while we’re there. <strong>We don’t have a workshop scheduled the weekend of the 14th, so if anyone wants to host us we’ll be in the bay area.</strong></p>
<p>Later in the month we’ll be in south Florida at Fort Myers, then I’ll be headed up to western Canada in Kelowna, BC in the last weekend of the month. We’ll also have some stuff going on in Atlanta as early as September, and I’ll announce that as soon as we finalize it.</p>
<p>We’re also going to start <strong>Live Webcast Presentations</strong> that are pertinent to both Workshop material and reader requests. The audience will be able to ask questions via chat throughout the presentation as well as a Q&amp;A section at the end. It’s too early to tell if speedos will make an appearance.</p>
<p>On top of the webcast theme, we’re going to have <strong>Chat Room Q&amp;A</strong> which will allow users to ask us questions on whatever; training, programming, advice on bullies, how to become a bully, etc. If it gets popular, we’ll have themes for the chats and perhaps special guests. The <strong>Live Webcast Presentations</strong> and <strong>Chat Room Q&amp;A</strong> will give the readers who live out of driving/sailing distance to interact and get some help.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’m going to start doing <strong>Form Check Help</strong>. No, I can’t coach you without being in person and I may not even be able to make an impact, but I’ve periodically helped people in all of the barbell lifts by giving them a helpful cue online. You’ll send in a video, I’ll analyze it and then we’ll chat on the phone about it for a bit. If your squat is a fucking train wreck, then I’m not going to charge you and will try and find you a Starting Strength coach to help you out. These little form checks will be very cheap ($10 and under depending on how many videos) and hopefully it will help those of you that train on your own.</p>
<p>Note: You can still send in videos to the site or my e-mail, but I won’t give it much attention and will only give you a brief response. You won’t get the whole “phone call” and “descriptive explanation” thing. Unless I like you.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<h2 id="pr-friday">PR Friday</h2>
<p>Go forth and record your Personal Beasts in the comments throughout the weekend. I hope to hear about your gained weight, lifted weight, children tossed, clothing ripped, and cannonballs performed. I also want to congratulate all the people that have written in and told me about their first lifting competition and how much they enjoyed it. I really like hearing about that stuff — it makes me proud of you guys…even if you <em>are</em> a pain in the ass 85% of the time. I’ll be posting about these exploits soon.</p>
<p>Take care and enjoy your weekend.</p>

<p>I founds Mark Felix’s YouTube channel on accident and the video that caught my attention was a “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNboO-k2x5U">rehab deadlift</a>” at 340kg. The info said, “Should be back up to 400kg next month.” Good god. My interest was piqued.</p>
<p>Felix, as he likes to be called, is one bad mofo. He’s 6’4″, around 300 pounds, has 21.5″ arms, and 31″ thighs. The former bodybuilder began competing in strongman in 2003 at 37 years old and is a regular entrant for the World’s Strongest Man competition. He also is a two time World Champion in the Rolling Thunder competition with a one handed lift of 301 pounds on the fat, rotating handle. That’s 26 pounds more than the second highest ever.</p>
<p>I don’t know much about Felix aside from the fact that he’s a large, strong behemoth who was born in Grenada and now lives in the UK. He seems to be a really cool guy; he’s married with kids and is always smiling or giving a thumbs up at the end of his videos.</p>
<p>This is probably my favorite video of Felix. He’s training his grip, and he picks the implements up and stands there kind of awkwardly. What he does next made me laugh.</p>

<p>Over the last two days I watched all of Felix’s videos. His brute strength and power is amazing and he trains with intensity in everything he does. These qualities have helped him come in 4th in the World Strongest Man competition (2006, 7th place in 2007), win the aforementioned Rolling Thunder competition twice (2008, ’09), as well as place in the top three of various other strength competitions such as World Strongest Man Super Series, Europe’s Strongest Man, All-American Strongman Challenge, Britain’s Strongest man, IFSA British Championships, England’s Strongest Man, etc.</p>
<p>To appreciate his shear gargantuan size, watch the following atlas stone video. You’ll notice he routinely competes in a kilt (and was excited about a new kilt arriving in the mail on his <a href="http://twitter.com/markfelixtv" target="_blank">Twitter page</a>).</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdYFYEcpMPw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p><a href="/2010/07/felix-4.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="2270" data-permalink="/blog/2010/07/i-like-mark-felix/felix-4/" data-orig-file="/2010/07/felix-4-e1279156058746.jpg" data-orig-size="243,375" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="felix-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2010/07/felix-4-e1279156058746.jpg" data-large-file="/2010/07/felix-4-e1279156058746.jpg" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2270" style="margin: 5px 10px" title="felix-4" src="/2010/07/felix-4-e1279156058746.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Felix only puts out one kind of effort when training: MAXIMAL. Two videos in particular display this very well. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOGWENjr_8c" target="_blank">The first video</a> consists of strongman training — barrel tossing in particular. Felix makes short work of tossing 10 kegs over a height of about 10 to 12 feet. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq4IyEGKRJg" target="_blank">The second video</a> pits Felix against another super heavyweight Highland Games competitor in the pole push. No, perverts, it isn’t a “no homo” situation — it’s kind of like sumo wrestling, but instead of pushing the opponent, the hold and push against the same caber. Felix and his nemesis battle it out for an entire minute. It’s exhausting to watch.</p>
<p>Mark Felix is still going strong at the age of 44. He sets a good example by training hard, being massive, and being a nice guy. I hope that he has many more competitive years ahead of him. You can read more about his training and diet <a href="http://www.strength-oldschool.com/index.php?/topic/161-mark-felix-strongman/">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Wouldn’t it be cool if you could get some of your friends and just go throw heavy stuff? Wouldn’t it be even better if there were drums, bugles, and bagpipes playing in the background and <a href="http://whatsonsa.co.za/portal/images/stories//Publicists/Buz%20Publicity/Highland%20dancers.jpg">women dancing</a> on a stage nearby? And wouldn’t it be complete if you tossed a telephone pole on your way to enjoy a cold Guinness?</p>
<p>There is such a place, my friends. It’s called Scottish Heavy Athletics, better known as Highland Games. I recently completed my second Highland Games at the Texas Scottish Festival, and I’m looking to make this my summer/fall sport.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.romanticasheville.com/images2009/highland_games2.jpg" class="aligncenter" width="450" height="276" /></p>
<p>The Highland Games contest up to nine different events</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/2010/07/WOB.jpg">56# weight over bar</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2010/07/stone.jpg">22-26# Braemar Stone throw</a> (like a stationary shot put but with a big rock)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16-22# Open Stone (like a shot put, including an approach to the toe board)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2010/07/sheaf.jpg">20# sheaf toss</a> (a bag of rope or straw thrown over a bar via pitchfork)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2010/07/HWD.jpg">56# weight for distance</a> (thrown with a discus-type approach)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2010/07/lwd.jpg">28# weight for distance</a> (same but with a lighter implement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2010/07/hammer.jpg">22# Scottish Hammer throw</a> (similar to Olympic hammer but wound around over the head and around the body with feet remaining stationary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>17# hammer (same but with a lighter implement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2010/07/caber.jpg">caber toss</a> (16-20′, 100-200+ pounds)</p>
</li>

<p>Some of the events make some sense from a combat perspective (I guess you could throw a rock or launch a hammer at someone who wasn’t too far away). And I guess the sheaf reminds one of throwing hay to the top of the barn (if one has done such things). But most of the events feel like the creation of a couple blacksmiths who fell into a barrel of mead.</p>

<p>Games are held throughout the country, usually beginning in the spring and running through fall. The pros are behemoths (and so are most of the amateurs), but don’t let that keep you away. Everyone in HG is cool, and they’re happy to welcome new people to their sport.</p>
<p>If you haven’t done it before, there’s not much you need to change. Just find a group to throw with and go from there. If the bug bites, then you can start worrying about specific training, buying/making implements, etc. I trained for this just like I do for judo. Instead of conditioning, I just substituted more throwing and event practice.</p>

<p>If you’re not signed up for something this summer, get your kilt together and do one of these. You’ll meet a good group of athletes and participate in something that’s somewhat off the wall. NASGAweb.com has listings, athlete data, and a discussion forum that addresses preparation and training. Get on it. You’ll thank me later.</p>
<p>Edit: I had to include this video because the timing of the throw and the music is pretty cool.</p>

<p>If you haven’t realized it already, Highland Games is a very 70sBig-friendly sport. I am 5’10 215 in the picture (I’m the guy holding the beer and the trophy), and I was the lightest guy by 25 pounds. My friend, Aaron (red beard, front row), is 280 and was maybe the fourth biggest guy there.</p>

  <p>Brent’s persona (personality?) is one that isn’t impressed by much. I can’t speak for Brent, but I was impressed by some lifts that occurred at the Junior Worlds in Olympic weightlifting.</p>
<p>In this video, Abti Aukadov snatches 160kg-165kg-170kg at 85kg. That’s pretty damn impressive, especially because he’s 17 years old, but I’m most impressed by his solid overhead position — it never wavers. His pulling motion is also very good. I’m impressed.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAtNCo-fTzg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>A 201kg clean and jerk to follow — these are huge numbers for a 17 year old. I’m impressed. I would expect him to make the trip to London in 2012. Kendrick Farris has his work cut out for him — let’s hope he keeps improving steadily as well!</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWNLqjRKz3M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>The next impressive video is Leidy Solis, a Columbian lifter, clean and jerking 139kg at a 67.4kg body weight. I just want to clarify that 139kg is more than 99% of what you goobers can do (realistically it’s not that far away from me — I plan on pulling away though). That is just damn silly. Oh, and she’s 20 years old. I will have to agree with Brent in liking her intensity as she is coming out of the hole (his words, not mine). I’m impressed.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwYaVM4lAQQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>

  <p><a href="http://weightlifting.teamusa.org/news/2010/07/08/inaugural-crossfit-usa-weightlifting-open-comes-to-colorado-springs-oct-1-3/37121">USA Weightlifting</a> and <a href="http://games2010.crossfit.com/blog/2010/07/crossfitusa-weightlifting-open-oct-1-3,633/">CrossFit</a> have combined forces to create a mixture of a lifting meet and a CrossFit conditioning workout. The CrossFit/USAW Open will be in Colorado Springs, CO on October 1st through the 3rd. This competition will begin with a normal Olympic weightlifting meet (for the new folk, the snatch is contested first, followed by the clean and jerk) and end with what is being referred to as “the triplet”. The conditioning workout will consist of as many rounds as possible of six squat cleans (55kg men / 30kg women), 12 pull-ups and 24 double unders.</p>
<p>Before I talk about what I think about this endeavor, let me clear a few things up. There are folk that read this site that primarily workout in a CrossFit facility. There are folk that read this site that don’t have anything to do with CrossFit. Subsequently, there are people that read the site that both do and do not like CrossFit for various reasons.</p>

<p>Gant and I, for some ungodly reason I’m sure we can’t fathom, have to defend ourselves whenever a joke is make about CrossFit. I’ll clarify this issue once again. I am doing what I’m doing indirectly because of CrossFit. I hated bodybuilding style training after I stopped playing football in college, started doing power/agility/strength training, and got into a bit o’ CrossFit. I co-owned a facility in southern Georgia. I was probably the youngest person certified as a ‘Level II CrossFit Trainer’. Doing all of that led to me getting in contact with Mark Rippetoe, and then it led to me moving to Wichita Falls to run CF style stuff. I had been playing around with strength related programming, and implemented and improved it in Wichita Falls. Throughout my time living there, I mainly got stronger (no conditioning). I coached barbell training in the gym and at seminars, and also started competing in Olympic weightlifting. I also started a joke and training philosophy with my friends that evolved into this website.</p>
<p>So there you have it, CrossFit was the inception that turned me onto the things I do now. I have a very clear understanding of what CrossFit is and have been around and have had discussions with people who run the company. I have met tons of great people through CrossFit, and I don’t regret any of it. My philisophical difference generally lies with an emphasis on barbell training for strength with conditioning to get conditioned for whatever the goal is. CrossFit style workouts are a tool but not used in every situation, although its principles are valuable. Another difference is that I feel better when skinny guys become stronger and bigger, primarily because they can usually do whatever it is that they want to do better with few exceptions. And lastly I believe there is value in competing in sanctioned sports that can improve the vigor of an individual and reverberate throughout their life. This brings us back full circle to the CrossFit/USAW Open.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think it’s a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<p>USAW has around 6,000 members including lifters, coaches, judges, and volunteers. That ain’t much, folks. CrossFit itself has…I dunno how many people, but they have over 1,000 affiliates. The majority of those facilities have bumper plates in them. Prior to this CrossFit explosion, you probably had to go to select Olympic weightlifting gyms in order to train the Olympic lifts (unless you had your own equipment). Now you can probably talk a local affiliate into letting you train there if you’re an experienced lifter. Furthermore, most of these facilities have people teaching people how to do the Olympic lifts. Now, the quality of coaching is going to vary drastically, but the point is there are a lot more people that have access to the sport of Olympic lifting as well as a lot more people actually doing the lifts, correctly or not. CrossFit is going to increase the number of lifters in USAW.</p>
<p>This does a number of good things. If the number of registered USAW lifters increases immediately and continues to do so over time, that means we have a larger talent pool of people who might be successful. I’ve heard rumors of China having one MILLION people in their lifting federation. If that’s even remotely true, they are destroying us on sheer volume. USAW might get some pretty decent lifters out of this CrossFit partnership.</p>
<p>This will also bring more money to USAW. I don’t really have an opinion on this either way, but maybe USAW can offer me more services, better discounts, or some other perk due to the increase in members and revenue. Hell, I don’t know. At the very least it will mean more people will try Olympic lifting, and that means I might get more business out of it. In either case, it’s about time USAW has taken advantage of the fact that CrossFit has tons of people throwing around barbells with bumper plates.</p>
<p>&lt;br/.</p>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<p>I guess the idea is that more people will try out CrossFit and become involved in it. I honestly don’t see this happening. The CrossFit money making machine will still roll with or without USAW (They have 19 Level I seminars in August. If 30 people attend each one — and sometimes it’s more — that’s 570 people at $1k each…and…that’s a lot of fucking money. And that’s only the Level I.). I don’t see USAW members as likely to try or at least stick with CrossFit, but it still opens that market up to CrossFit. From what I’ve seen online, I just don’t know how much of the hardcore weightlifters will try a conditioning workout, and I suspect that the majority of participants in this CrossFit/USAW Open will be people coming from CrossFit. And there’s nothing wrong with that because it brings more people into a sport that needs exposure.</p>
<p>Now, the actual conditioning workout itself could be tweaked. To recap, it consists of six squat cleans (55kg men / 30kg women), 12 pull-ups and 24 double unders. Now, let me clarify that I’m probably not gonna compete in this thing because I’m poor and will be more concerned with a local meet and preparing for the American Open. Personally I think this is biased towards the CrossFitter just a bit. The weightlifter doesn’t incorporate kipping pull-ups of any kind into his training because they aren’t very useful. The CrossFitter stereotypically does a shit load of them. Furthermore, if someone were going to get 10 rounds of this workout in, they’d be doing 120 pull-ups, which the weightlifter would never bother with. Hands will be ripping and DOMS will be almost as prevalent as the internet insults that will follow the hand rippage. I don’t really care that this is biased, but it is objectively biased nonetheless.</p>
<p>Instead, I would have switched the cleans and the pull-ups. 6 pull-ups followed by 12 cleans would be more appropriate. The limiting factor wouldn’t be grip strength on the bar or skin remaining on the hand. I could do 55kg cleans all day long — as any man should. I don’t think that this would have tilted the bias more in the weightlifter’s favor since a CrossFitter is supposed to be doing cleans anyway, regardless of a lifting meet. And it’s so damn light that they would be fine anyway.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Overall, I thin this partnership is a damn good idea and way overdue. More CrossFitters will try Olympic lifting. Some of them may compete in it on a regular basis and I don’t see this as a bad thing. As for the event itself, I think that “the triplet” could have been designed better, but at least it wasn’t one of the awfully contrived workouts that pop up every now and then on CrossFit’s website.</p>
<p>———————————</p>
<p><em>A few more thoughts</em></p>
<p>Justin asked for my thoughts on this, so here they are. <strong>I think this idea sucks.</strong> The USAW will have to sign an extra Crossfitter up because I won’t be renewing my membership.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good people who operate and train in CF gyms who work hard and do well. That’s not the issue (let this soak in before you accuse me of being anti-CF). My beef with this is USAW’s catering to CF and CF’s refusal to acclimate and compete in an actual sport. Glassman claimed, in one of his hyperbolic declarations, “we can do your stuff almost as well as you can.” Really? <strong>Here was your chance!</strong> But instead of doing someone else’s stuff, you had to make this look like your stuff. Keep moving those goalposts up until they hit you right in the face.</p>
<p>There is no reason they couldn’t have hosted an all-CF weightlifting meet. Enforce the rules and use actual judging standards. Sure, you might have a lot of guys pressing out jerks, making AC Jumps, and going 3-for-6. That’s part of learning. Those same lifters will be there next time going 5-for-6 and getting 3 PRs. They jettisoned an outstanding opportunity to learn and grow so they could take their shirts off and sling some 55kg cleans (WTF, we’re not even into the blues?!).</p>
<p>So yeah, I think this cheapens both organizations. This will sell a few more USAW memberships, but it won’t do anything to improve America’s weightlifting prospects. The next Kendrick Farris isn’t doing Fran in some Crossfit box.</p>
<p>Hopefully NASGA won’t have me doing burpees after throwing a PVC caber.</p>

  <p><strong>The Comment of the Week</strong> is from the speedo post (which had an incredibly high page view number, easily the highest ever on this site):</p>
<p><strong>StonewallWells Says</strong>:</p>
<p><em>July 7th, 2010 at 5:31 pm e</em></p>
<p>Justin-</p>
<p>Regarding the New Services, can we request that you wear your speedo if we were to do a video conference. It only seems reasonable, after all we ARE the customers and the customers are ALWAYS right.</p>
<p>_You’re gonna have to request me to NOT wear a speedo.</p>
<p>–Justin_</p>
<p>Stonewall brings up a good point, because there will be live video presentations of material coming soon as well as scheduled chat rooms with us 70’s Big contributors doing the moderating.</p>

  <p>AC has been training with Taylor, a good friend that I used to pal around with when I was still in school. Taylor has pretty impressive pressing strength and bear-like features. I have heard stories of him cuddling a grizzly in its den because he “needed a soft warm body in those winter months”. I wasn’t shocked when he told me this.</p>
<p>A-way is his fiance and is in the top three funniest girls I know. She has surprising ferocity in her miniature stature, especially regarding her bear hug (it helps with Taylor). They are both the feature of another original AC film, and AC makes a deadlifting appearance at the end. Sweet song too.</p>

<p>In early June, Brent hit a PR Snatch at the WFAC in the midst of his powerlifting training.</p>

<p>Here’s a vid of Chris pulling 600 back in May (I think). He doesn’t get pumped at all, and that’s a rarity for him. I thought it was more impressive because he just walks up to the bar and pulls it (trust me, I know what he’s like when he’s amped).</p>

  <p><strong>The Zombie Killer: Sergey Litvninov</strong></p>
<p><em>By Mike Hom</em></p>
<p>I have to say that I love Brent’s articles on inspirational lifters. I’m also fond of the heroes of 70’s Big. Doug Young would make any guy and girl wet between the legs and Pisarenko sported a ‘stache that would make Ron Jeremy envious. It’s no wonder why both men are co-captains of the 70’s Big Hall of Fame. But, if I had to a pick a hero that inspired me beyond measure to train hard, it would be Sergey Litvinov.</p>
<p><a href="/2010/07/litvinov-e1278569561513.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="2171" data-permalink="/blog/2010/07/the-zombie-killer-sergey-litvninov-by-mike-hom/litvinov/" data-orig-file="/2010/07/litvinov-e1278569704276.jpg" data-orig-size="187,310" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="litvinov" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2010/07/litvinov-e1278569704276.jpg" data-large-file="/2010/07/litvinov-e1278569704276.jpg" class="size-medium wp-image-2171 alignleft" style="margin: 5px" title="litvinov" src="/2010/07/litvinov-e1278569704276.jpg" alt="" width="187" height="310" /></a></p>
<p>Before I go into why Sergey Litvinov would be the first defense against Zombies, as well why he should be inducted into the 70’s Big Hall of Fame, let me give a bit of background on the man and how I came to know about him.</p>
<p>Litvinov is the subject of an article written by <a href="http://danjohn.net/">Dan John</a> that I immediately took to heart when it was first published years back. I sincerely doubt Dan John embellished any in his article, but even if he did, I don’t care. It has inspired literally scores of people to try to emulate the same caliber of athleticism that was described in this article which can be found <a href="http://www.tmuscle.com/article/performance_training/the_litvinov_workout">here</a>. Go ahead. Google “litvinov” or “litvinov workout” and the first hit will be Dan John’s article on T-Nation as well as other related sites.</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to read the article, Litvinov was a gold medal winning hammer thrower that inspired American Discus Thrower John Powell to switch up his training regiment through his observations of Litvinov’s training. Dan John described the standard Litvinov workout to be very simple but extremely tough.</p>
<p>Try this on for size:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Eight reps of front squats with 405 lbs., immediately followed by a 75-second 400-meter run. Repeat this little combination for a total of three times and go home, thank you. Let’s just stop here and marvel at what Powell observed. A 196 lbs. man front squatted 405… eight times!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s not forget that he did this 3 times total for a total of 24 squats at 405 lbs. Now, I don’t know about every one of you 70’s Big readers but I can back squat 405 lbs. for a double on a good day and front squat 315 lbs. The man did this eight times and then ran 400m in 75 seconds. 75 seconds is over 30 seconds slower than the current 400m world record, but is still faster than what most people can do. Compound the fact that the man squatted 405 lbs. eight times prior to running makes this an incredible feat. The only other bit of information about Litvinov’s training is from wikipedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Litvinov">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Litvinov</a>) and the entry states Litvinov was rumored to be able to muscle snatch 100kg / 220 lbs. for quick sets of 10. Now, whether that it is completely accurate or not doesn’t matter. The mythology surrounding this man was that he could MUSCLE SNATCH 100 kilos for quick SETS — not A set — of 10.</p>
<p>A few only slightly less plausible rumors about Litvinov’s capacity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Milo carried the calf. Litvinov carried Milo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Litvinov was known for his use of max effort box jumps to augment his power development. Typically he’d warm up at 24″, 48″, and then progress to the Matterhorn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once, Litvinov was accosted by a horde of angry lumberjacks. Rather than thrashing them thoroughly, as he clearly could have, he made a peace offering of beer and sausages. They drank and ate, and proceeded to see who could chop down trees the quickest. Thus, Timbersports, one of the manliest athletic events ever, was created.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that astute readers will catch on to the fact that he is below 200 lbs. Further, the picture of him in Dan John’s article shows that he is clean shaven. OK, so there’s a few things going against him. So why does he deserve to be inducted into the 70’s Big Hall of Fame?</p>
<p>I think we have established, to some extent, that 70’s Big is not merely about the physical appearance of your being. It is an attitude. It is about training as hard as you can to achieve tangible goals. Are you eating to facilitate your goals? Are you doing what you can to get as strong as you humanly can within the context of your every day life? Are you training intelligently to ensure long term success? That, among other things, is 70’s Big for me. Litvinov illustrates that he was willing to train hard to achieve his goals. After all, he is a two time Olympic medalist and set three world records in the hammer throw, which brings me to reasons as to why he would be the first defense against a Zombie invasion.</p>
<p>Assuming he had a good deal of strength in his other core lifts relative to his front squat, he embodies a good mix of strength and speed, which I feel is extremely important. Let’s say, for example, you had a comrade trapped under a heavy object and a group of Zombies were headed towards your direction. You would want to sprint over there and lift the object up to your partner and this might require a deadlift, or some semblance of a clean to get that object completely off the damsel — I mean, partner — in distress. Further, you want to be able to grab your partner and run if necessary. Let’s face it, you can’t be a skinny twit who can run miles but have a hard time carrying anything heavier than a water pack. Conversely, while huge strong men will generally not have an issue with lifting, heaving, and carrying heavy weight, zombies may overtake you for reasons stemming from bad conditioning. That is also assuming you get to your partner before keeling over from being out of breath. Either way, it’s not a good look. Litvinov could probably sprint over to you, pick you up, and set you upright. Then he would probably immediately sprint over to some type of cover, lift pieces of broken car and toss them at incoming zombies. If he had hammers with him, I’m sure he would make Thor jealous with how he could toss a hammer through multiple zombie heads.</p>
<p>So, I guess I am kind of going against the grain here with this nomination of The Litvi into the 70’s Big Hall of Fame. But, let’s face it. If I needed someone to pull me out of some wreckage in the middle of an urban jungle, I would want someone who had the uncanny strength AND conditioning to save me and other team members while carrying cinematic-movie-levels of ammunition and ordnance to combat the Zombie horde. He would also need to throw hammers at show stopping distances to let Zombie heads blossom and burst forth a sea of blood of brain matter. And finally, he would need to have the raw power to perform multiple Spartan kicks to punch a hole through a Zombie’s chest on any given day.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’d have him on my team.</p>

  <p>I don’t know if you guys know this, but guys in the 70s wore speedos to the beach. I decided to bring this style back to the gulf coast. The feeling of empowerment was overwhelming.Yes, 70’s Big gives you wings.</p>
