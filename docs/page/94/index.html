  <p>Quick post today. Here’s another video of guys who weigh between 60 and 70 kilos being tossed around by a strong female. Don’t let this be you.</p>

  <p>Andy Bolton is still kicking ass, and now he’s doing it RAWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!111!~`1`121J`3412R8I09SADJLKSDAJF</p>
<p>Ahem…Bolton competed at the BPC Push/Pull competition. He benched 280kg/617lbs just because, and then walked out and smoked the piss out of a 432.5kg/953lbs deadlift…just because.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOMX29g8QVM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Well, not “just because”, and you can read why <a href="http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/node/15495">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to this comp not really knowing what i would be able to do,after only 6 deadlift workouts since my knee surgery in november 2009 i went there in my mind would have been happy with 900 thats why i did not use a suit i wanted to hold it back and not get hurt again,so anyway warm ups went well up to 660lb then my opener 770 then to mid 8s after this it felt so so light so i wanted pull more than anybody else out there with no suit and it felt easy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andy followed that statement up with a challenge for anybody to meet him at the 2011 Andy Bolton Deadlift Challenge, if the challengers were “up to it”. I wonder if Konstantinovs will be there? He has pulled 939 raw, although it was much more difficult than Bolton (and that was about a year ago):</p>

  <p><a href="http://toledoblade.com/article/20100418/SPORTS17/100419747/-1/SPORTS" target="_blank">Mike Barwis</a> is the current strength and conditioning coach of the Michigan Wolverines. He’s an accomplished coach who has worked with all sports at the collegiate level, professional athletes, and Olympians. However, he’s best known for aiding the football programs at West Virginia (’03-’07) and Michigan (since ’08).</p>
<p>Let me preface the following thoughts with a few statements:</p>
<p>– I don’t know Barwis</p>
<p>– I’m not a Michigan fan</p>
<p>– At the time of this writing, I haven’t seen any programs by Barwis, only articles and a crazy YouTube video I’ll link below</p>
<p>– His track record speaks for itself</p>
<p>My impression is that Barwis has a general strength program, and then he quickly converts this strength into what I will refer to here as “usable strength”. Obviously if someone is very strong and they cannot apply that strength into proper, efficient, and effective movement on the field, then they are of no use to the football coaching staff. In the video below, Barwis explains his gamut of conditioning, movement based flexibility, and increasing the athlete’s ability to do their job on the field with sport specific work. It’s kind of hard to summarize the “Barwis Philsophy”, since his explanation of his program lasts nine minutes:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPAMsH2fJBA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>You’ll notice the guy is…full of energy. You’ll notice he has a raspy voice. You probably now understand why he garners respect from his athletes — he shows them that he cares by exhibiting his commitment to their success. As he succeeds, his reputation grows, and he is nearing Chuck Norris status.</p>
<p>Apparently he owned two pet wolves that he used to wrestle. He has a MMA background (that he doesn’t talk about much). Some West Virginia players attempted to catch him off guard and give him a friendly woopin’, but he took them out before they knew what happened (read about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Barwis" target="_blank">here </a>on Wikipedia). But most importantly, he treats his athletes like family.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget his accomplishments. One example is Brandom Graham, who weighed 315, benched 315, and power cleaned 225 when he got on campus. Now he’s 265, benching 495, and power cleaning 445. Barwis makes it known that they aren’t concerned with only weight room strength, but taking that strength and applying it to football, yet those numbers with Graham are still impressive nonetheless.</p>
<p>There are countless games where Michigan has performed well in the second half, and the entire team attributed it to their superior conditioning. Barwis gets is athletes strong and conditioned, and does so while earning the respect of all of his athletes — this means I’m a fan. Good stuff.</p>

  <p>The term “stack” has its origins in Old Norse as having to do with haystacks. Shortly around this time, men were noted to say, “Aye, that women be stacked to the brim,” since a particularly well endowed female trait made the appearance of two neatly placed haystacks. That last sentence wasn’t actually true. For whatever reason, the term “stack” was associated with a nutritional (natural or otherwise) supplement to one’s training. I don’t know if it originated in bodybuilding, Olympic lifting, or power lifting, and to be honest, I don’t really give a poo. These days it seems to have a bodybuilding connotation, which is usually comically unnecessary. Modern bodybuilding literature (propaganda?) is infamous for its ridiculous products with promised results. Thus, in certain groups, “stack’ may have a negative connotation.</p>
<p>That is, until Brent Kim decided to be a pain in the ass.</p>

    Typical waste of money stack
  </p>
</div>
<p>There are some essential items that a lifter should, in essence, stack onto their training. It is important to note that the value of these items is reduced to precisely “dick” if you aren’t eating appropriate amounts of protein and calories in order to recover and improve. But, for the sake of this post, we are going to assume you have this under control (Guideline: 1g of protein per lb of bodyweight, and if you aren’t recovering, then you aren’t getting enough calories).</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long ago that Brent’s training stack was a healthy dose of kimchee and bulgogie (Korean barbecue, which is top notch). Then there came a time when Brent duly noted the fish oil intake that I adhered to. The following conversation ensued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent: How much should I take?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Well, I take about 14g, so you should probably take 8 to 10</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent: I’m going to take 28 grams because I am twice the man you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus Brent started thinking about his stack. Thinking led to reading, reading let to more thought, and then, Brent wanted to know what everyone else’s stack was. Relentlessly.</p>
<p>“Hey man, what’s your stack?” was asked both in a serious and comical manner. Serious, for he really did want to know, and comical because the usage of the term “stack” is previously associated with the bodybuilding silliness described above. When Brent first started saying it, it was embarrassing, because anybody who heard might think he was serious about the term. The problem was that he was serious, but now it’s okay because he/we have changed the term into its new accepted usage and meaning (which generally gets out of hand with my group of friends).</p>
<p>In any case, your stack is something that is “stacked onto” your training program and your food intake. If your food intake isn’t appropriate for your goals, then you don’t have any business worrying about your stack. If you don’t even know how you should be eating to accomplish your goals, then you have some research to do, and still don’t need to worry about your stack. Even if you did have all of those things taken care of, a lifter doesn’t need much in his stack to reap the supplemental rewards. Here are some essentials.</p>
<p><em>Note: As always, consult your physician about any of this stuff. If you take any of this stuff because you read about it here, you do so at your own risk. If you are unsure about any of it, then don’t take it.</em></p>
<p>**Whey Protein</p>
<p>** This may not even be considered part of a stack because it might be a staple to your diet. In any case, it’s supplemental to food, so I’ll include it here. If you aren’t getting your allotted protein intake, then nothing else really matters. Sometimes you’re in a pinch and can’t eat all of it in the source of meat, so whey protein is a nice, quick replacement. You don’t need to buy anything expensive, because all the brands will do the same thing anyway. Most brands are outfitted with BCAA’s, and generally the more money you spend, the better it tastes. However, if they make claims on the absorption rate or any of that other bullshit, just ignore it. It’s useless, and we are worried about the chronic intake of protein anyway. My buddy Mike likes the Optimum Nutrition brand because their protein is tasty, and they have lots of flavors. You can also get the EAS brand at Sam’s Club for pretty cheap.</p>
<p>**Multi-Vitamin</p>
<p>** Vitamins and minerals are vital to a healthy, functioning body. Sometimes our diet doesn’t include all of the goodies that we may need. Even if you are eating plenty of Paleo-esque meats, fats, vegetables, and fruits, you may accidentally neglect something. In such a case, having a decent multivitamin can pick up the slack. If you are training hard then you’ll need more vitamins anyway, and if you’re eating to gain mass you’ll be purposely neglecting some healthy foods. Cover your bases with a generic brand multi-vitamin — you don’t have to spend lots of money on it. Bill Starr always recommended the shovel technique to get more than you’ll actually need. This is fine with water soluble vitamins (Vitamins C and B-vitamins) because you’ll just pee the excess out, but keep an eye on some brands that have crazy amounts of fat soluble vitamins like A, K, D, and E. I’m not saying shy away from them (especially because we’ll need more of most stuff when we’re training hard), but you won‘t need ridiculous amounts. Lastly, make sure your multi-vitamin is equipped with magnesium and zinc.</p>
<p>**Fish Oil</p>
<p>** I haven’t done a literature review on fish oil, but I’ve seen some of the research. In any case, lots of people who are “in the know” regarding nutrition recommend fish oil for its anti-inflammatory properties, it’s improvement on blood lipid profiles, and its apparent ability to lower the chance of certain diseases, conditions, and cancers. As a lifter, you want it for the anti-inflammatory properties, because when you lift hard, you get lots of inflammation. Following that logic, it is something that has the potential to help with recovery, and that’s what we want. To get an idea of how much you should take, here is a <a href="http://whole9life.com/fish-oil/">fish oil calculator</a> that my friend <a href="http://whole9life.com/about-us/">Melissa Urban</a> created for Robb Wolf’s <a href="http://robbwolf.com/">blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Creatine</strong></p>
<p>“Creatine is one of the only supplements that does what it actually says it is going to do.” — paraphrased from conversations with Dr. Kilgore. As a clunky summary, it helps the phosphocreatine system reproduce ATP faster, and this helps in the recovery from short, intense bursts of work (like what happens in lifting). There has been talk on the internet of “non-responders”, but the real problem is getting it to absorb correctly (there are quite a few factors that can limit absorption). Dr. Kilgore once told me that mixing the monohydrate in chocolate milk is a fantastic way to help it absorb (the lipids and sugars each play their part — look up how these things are digested for clarification). The general consensus for ingesting creatine monohydrate is to load for 5 days at 0.3g/kg of bodyweight, and then maintain at .03g/kg bodyweight.</p>
<p>There is a new product called creatine ethyl ester which gets converted into creatine within the body. The draw is that it apparently absorbs better, but it’s more expensive, and I don’t have time for ‘more expensive’.</p>
<p><strong>Fiber</strong></p>
<p>When eating to increase or maintain mass, vegetables may get ignored. In such a case, you are gonna want to eat some fiber. I’ve written about it before here: /?p=1041</p>
<p>Intestinal benefits aside, it will make your bathroom time more enjoyable, especially if you’re drinking a gallon of milk.</p>
<p><strong>Glucosamine and Chondroitin Sulfate</strong></p>
<p>This stuff is supposed to help with joint health. Hell, I don’t know if it works. Some people swear by it and some people swear at it. I figured that since I want to lift throughout my entire life, and since I’m doing a lot of jumping around in the Olympic lifts, I my as well try it. I wouldn’t say I had sore knees, but I could feel them after some rough Oly workouts, sometimes the next day. I got a cheap pair of cloth knee sleeves and started taking glucosamine/chondroitin, and I haven’t noticed it anymore. Lots of factors go into this, but if you’re willing to try anything…</p>
<p>Again, I want to reiterate that none of this really matters if you aren’t eating well. Tons of people will have opinions on nutritional supplementation and most will get weirdly complicated. I’m not really into that; I just get a few things to try and maximize my recovery without spending a whole lot of money. I’m sure most of you will have some kind of comment today. Realistically, the only person you should listen to is Gant, because most of you don’t know why the hell you’re taking something.</p>

<p>Weight lifted, food eaten, children tossed, etc.</p>
<p>I expect the female participation to continue. Damn it.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>next week is the last week to get mustaches pics in.</strong> I’m gonna post some over the weekend.</p>

<p>An e-mail from Micah, who just experienced his last day of high school:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well Justin,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now i am on the path to being 70sbig. Right now I am 5’10” weighing in at 215. But anyways today was my last day of high school and at the water day party all i did was overhead press girls and then throw them in pools. Needless to say giggles and numbers ensued, and a lot of questions of why are you so strong? None of the 90’ssmall 6 packers were able to lift two girls at the same time. Yes being 70s big has many many perks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks 70sbig.com</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Micah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I e-mailed Micah back asking if he would mind me posting this on the site, he replied with, “Not at all, Justin. Post that shit up.”</p>

<p>Here is a video of Colton finishing his linear progression. In August he was 120 pounds. Now he is 175 pounds. His squat went from 95 lbs to 275x5x3. Here is the second set (you can see the other sets on my YouTube page):</p>

<p>Two of my friends from Statesboro, GA. You all know Ace McGonague on the left, and then Taylor is on the right. There are rumors swirling that Taylor aims to weigh 320…</p>
<p>A couple years ago I spotted him on bench when he did 405 for a single (decent bounce, but we are more edumicated now).</p>

  <h2 id="chris8217-mishap">Chris’ Mishap</h2>
<p>Chris just left for a much needed vacation before he dials his training in to get ready for the USAPL Raw National Championship in July. He and his family were planing the plane (which must be the opposite of the term “de-plane” the flight attendants always use), and Chris found himself in a precarious situation. After he shambled down the aisle of the plane and squeezed himself into the seat row, he made an attempt at sitting down. Buuuuuut, he couldn’t. You see, his 6′, 275 pound body didn’t fit in the seat. What could they do?</p>
<p>Well, this is a guy who broke five chairs in a week’s time not too long ago. Between going to school, training at the gym, and drinking beer at a bar, Chris managed to render five chairs inoperable…on accident. So what the hell were they doing to do with him on the plane?</p>
<p>Clearly the only solution was to move him to first class. It makes sense, after all. Do not anger the large man. Do what he says. Oh, you want some beer on your flight? Yes sir, Mr. 70’s Big, right away sir. Anything else sir?</p>
<p>Yes it’s true, the quest to 70’s Big has its perks.</p>

<h2 id="strength-magazine">Strength+ Magazine</h2>
<p>There’s a new online magazine that is dedicated to Olympic Weightlifting that just started. This is good because there aren’t many resources for American weightlifting, and that’s unfortunate. The magazine is called “Strength+” and is written and edited by Rachel Crass and Robert Hall. This first issue has a few athlete articles (notably on Kendrick Farris, the superstar of American weightlifting), an article about the French national team, and results and photos from the Arnold Classic.</p>

  <p>Spring semesters all over the country are coming to a close. For most college football programs, this means that most of the athletes will go home for a couple of months before coming back for pre-season practice before school starts. A typical program will put their players through a gamut of tests to see how well (or not?) they improved. The LSU football did such a thing, and <a href="http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&amp;ATCLID=204945225">recently posted an article about it</a>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1791" data-permalink="/blog/2010/05/not-impressed/lsu/" data-orig-file="/2010/05/lsu.jpg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="lsu" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2010/05/lsu.jpg" data-large-file="/2010/05/lsu.jpg" src="/2010/05/lsu.jpg" alt="" title="lsu" width="300" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1791" srcset="/2010/05/lsu.jpg 300w, /2010/05/lsu-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Before I say anything else, let me clarify that I’m an SEC guy. I like LSU in the sense that I will root for them when they play non-conference teams. I’ve watched many memorable games (my favorite being a defensive showdown a few years ago with Auburn — the 4th quarter was amazing). SEC Football is typically some of the most impressive, exciting college football in the country. The teams yield impressive athletes and the conference is known for the quality of intra-conference competition. I’m not crazy about one college football team or another, but I do dislike some teams. LSU is not one of those teams. I say all this, because college football fans are fucking nut jobs and I don’t really care to get into a crazy fan war.</p>
<p>With all that being said, one phrase comes to mind when I see the results of LSU’s testing:</p>
<p>Not impressed.</p>
<p>Sorry. Scroll down in that article and look at the top 5 squatters. 545, 535 (3 times), and 510. Really? These guys are the cream of the genetic crop from high school. Some of them may have a shot at the NFL, and they play on one of the best teams in one of the best conferences in the country. Even I squatted 500 for an easy triple a few weeks ago. I will give Patrick Peterson some props — he’s a cornerback listed at 6’1 and 211 (which means he’s actually 5’10” and 195). In other words, he is almost squatting the most on the team weighing around 200 pounds while there are guys who weigh 290+.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand these guys are football players and their primary “sport” is not lifting. But I really expected to see some 600+ squats on the team. Maybe even 700.</p>
<p>I’m not really impressed with the clean numbers either. The best clean, which was a school record, is 374. Granted, I’ve never cleaned 170 kg yet (I’ve done 165), I just really expected these genetic freaks to be doing more. It is important to note that Michael Ford (a sophomore running back who is listed at 5’10” and 207) led the team with a 42″ vertical jump AND was third on the team with a 352 lb clean. There is definitely a correlation between these two activities, and neuromuscular efficiency dictates this. It’s genetic, so you either have it or you don’t. Sorry I’m not sorry.</p>
<p>The other lifts tested were the jerk (which I found surprising, but good on them for incorporating the jerk into their program and getting pretty decent numbers) and bench press. Now, these fulls definitely went into beast mode on the bench. The top BP was Drake Nevis, a defensive lineman listed at 6’1″ and 292 lbs, at 475 lbs. Obviously these guys are raw, and that’s damned impressive. Guess who got second on the BP? Michael Ford at 425. Read that again — a 207 lb running back just benched 425. Fuck.</p>
<p>The hand timed 40 yard dash is iffy, though. If you’ve ever followed SEC 40 times (cough, cough, Florida), then you know they are comically low. The fastest time was Patrick Peterson, that little ol’ cornerback who squatted 535. Now, it is hand timed, but if you have a dude like that running that fast with that kind of strength behind him…he’s gonna do some damage.</p>
<p>Guys like Patrick Peterson, Michael Ford, and Drake Nevis are why football continues to be an impressive sport. Knowing that they possess that kind of ability makes me want to follow them throughout the season. I like guys that work hard in the gym.</p>
<p>But, football is a game that is dependent on the hips, and this makes squatting and cleans the most important exercises to improve performance. I would have assumed these lifts would have been monstrous, and they are right about what I am capable of. I coached somebody who played football in college with Brian Urlacher, and they said he power cleaned 405. That’s the kind of stuff I expected to see. Until I see some 600 pound squats, I will continue to be “not impressed” no matter how good their 40 times or bench presses are.</p>

<p>Hey Justin,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, I have poor hamstring extensibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The test I have used for this is to put my feet together lock my back in lumbar extension and bow forward with my knees locked. I get to just above 45 degree from the horizontal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am concerned that this may be causing problems with my DL and Squat. I was missing a few DLs, usually with my back losing extension in later reps. Also on squats I buttwink, but also I really don’t feel the bounce at all, which could be another problem all together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The short run would be: is poor hamstring extensibility a big deal? Do you find it inhibits your trainees DL &amp; squats? Are things like barbell assistance (RDL, SLDL) exercises better than good ol’ stretching?</p>
<p>I appreciate any words you can muster.</p>

<p>Hamstring extensibility is the same thing as <strong>flexibility</strong>. A good definition of flexibility is</p>
<p><u>having sufficient range of motion (ROM) around major joints to meet the demands of every day activities as well as any other activities that are participated in</u>. This means that flexibility is relative to the individual and what they do. For example, I like to strength train and compete in Olympic weightlifting, therefore I should be sufficiently flexible for both. I am not, however, a gymnast/dancer/ninja, and therefore do not need the flexibility to do a split for <a href="http://www.vandamme.ru/photos/movies/timecop/timecop29.jpg">any reason</a>.</p>
<p>The hamstrings are a group of muscles on the back of the thigh that always get a bad rap of “being tight”. While it’s true that it is farily common to have inflexible hamstrings, it isn’t as big a problem as it has been made out to be. The squat (AKA low bar back squat to those of you who aren’t familiar with Starting Strength) is a wonderful exercise to stretch the hamstrings.</p>
<p>The hamstrings attach at the ischial tuberosity (on the bottom of the pelvis) and wrap around the knee (condyles of the tibia, head of the fibula, etc.). When you squat properly (reference the squat chapter of Starting Strength), you set your knees by pushing them out, which angles the femurs parallel with the feet, and then you sit back with your hips so that the hamstrings (and adductors) are stretched out. These are requirements for the “bounce” to occur out of the bottom of the squat. Each time you do a full ROM squat, it is like a PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) stretch. A PNF stretch is essentially placing a muscle in a position in which it will elongate while intermittently contracting the muscle to improve flexibility (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=pnf+stretching">for more</a>).</p>
<p>The problem is that you must do the squat correctly and through a full range of motion, and not everyone is capable of teaching themselves this complex movement (it is one of the hardest lifts to master). If you consider yourself to have poor hamstring flexibility, then you need to first think about shoving your knees OUT and then sitting BACK. If it feels normal, then you’re doing it incorrectly. If you have never felt a full stretch on your adductors and hamstrings, you should know the first time you do.</p>
<p>Another factor with squatting/deadlifting and hamstring flexibility is that it may take you a few sets to get the muscles warm enough to go through the correct ROM. In such a case, you should make sure to incorporate a general warm-up and extra warm-up sets into your training session.</p>
<p>I’ve never had a problem with getting anyone to do a full ROM squat the first time that I teach them, and Rip has always said it is never a problem at all of the seminars he has done over the past few years. The best solution is to find someone that can coach you whether it be at a gym locally or at a seminar (the <a href="http://www.aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=212">Starting Strength Seminars</a> are utilized for reasons like this all the time).</p>
<p>Until you have squatted correctly, it is a waste of time to try anything else to loosen up your hamstrings. The squat will not only improve hamstring flexibility, but it will also (re)teach the hamstrings how to undergo a stretch reflex and also strengthen the muscles throughout the full ROM.</p>
<p>As for Cormac’s lack of extension in his back on his deadlifts, I don’t have enough information to have an opinion. He could be using bad form, is really skinny, attempting too much weight, or is doing everything correctly and having the natural curvature of the back on a heavy set of five. However, judging from his seeming hamstring inflexibility, I place the fault on the form on both his squat and deadlift.</p>
<p>The butt wink he references is over-hyped, and this is probably due to the CrossFit community branding it in their “air squat”. A butt wink is not that big of a deal assuming the squat is otherwise done correctly. It may even be anthropometry that looks like a butt wink — people that have a long pelvis and short torso will appear to be rounding their low back when it is actually the iliac crests of their pelvis. Besides, if the butt wink exists because of inflexibility, proper squatting will make it subside and disappear over time.</p>
<p>Again, a proper warm-up and squatting can cure common hamstring inflexibility and trying anything else is a waste of time until these are addressed. Barring any limiting pathology, the inflexible will become flexible.</p>

  <p>Look, I really don’t have anything to post. I have lots of medium length posts that I have to write, lots of lifters to induct into the hall of fame, lots of Olympic lifting to cover, lots of people to feature, but none of that is a quick write up, and none of it is happening tonight (Sunday night). You’ll always get my honesty.</p>
<p>We had a small group at the 70’s Big Workshop in Allen, Texas. I’ve mentioned that the workshop will adapt to the crowd, and this one shifted into the benefits of strength training and ways to incorporate it into training programs. If you want to host a workshop, <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">e-mail me</a>.</p>
<p>On a similar note, Chris graduated from college this past weekend. We had a little shindig and congratted him. To celebrate, here is the following video.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/d2xL1Zg1U80?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>So, somebody strike up an interesting conversation in the comments. You guys are always welcome to send me links to stuff that you consider 70’s Big (it makes for entertaining posts, like <a href="/?p=1772">last Friday’s</a>), send in photos (although sometimes they don’t make it on the site), or send in videos. Maybe somebody will come up with something good. Happy Monday.</p>

  <p>Well my friends, <strong>PR Friday</strong> is upon us once again. Sure, we’ll have all the same kind of stories where people rip their pants, lift something relatively heavy, or eat plenty of food, but I <strong>want to call out the ladies this weekend and have them post some PR’s</strong>. Hey, a PR is a PR, and it doesn’t matter if that weight is great or small, it still matters to me — I wanna hear about it. So c’mon ladies, let me hear your stories. Dudes, get your ladies postin’.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>Avi sent me an amusing rugby video that is a wonderful display of why you don’t want to be 90’s Small on the pitch. He tells me the larger player is 6’5″ and 135kg while the smaller player is 5’11” and 83kg. Click play to see what happens (sorry about the wide frame, but it’s HD, yo).</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/88zKlovZJKg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>Brian sent in <a href="http://www.buzzhumor.com/videos/16817/Hooters_Chick_Squats_A_Guy" target="_blank">this video</a> of a Hooters waitress squatting some 90’s Small guy. Good for the waitress and shame on the not-a-man on her shoulders. What perturbs me more than anything is one of the comments on the video. It reads,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow, that has happened too me a few times. I had an Ex-Girlfriend who could pick me up on her shoulders like a feather…Just goes too show that Women are not the weaker gender, and us Guys better start getting used too that, or we will be getting picked up and spun around by Women too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uhh…</p>
<p>Look, ladies, if you can pick your boyfriend up “like a feather”, then you don’t have a boyfriend, you have a child-friend. It’s okay to lug him around once in a while, but it shouldn’t be that easy because he should be an adult male. I can’t tell you how many times I hear, “Man, I didn’t realize how much I enjoyed a guy who weighs over 200 pounds better than a skinny-pain-in-the-ass guy until I tried it out” (not a direct quote, but true story nonetheless).</p>
<p>This isn’t a discussion about women’s rights, or their roles in society. It is simply a statement that a ravishing woman deserves man, not a skinny little puke (not to be confused with <a href="/?p=484" target="_blank">Johnny Spuke</a>, who is the exact opposite). And fellas, you owe it to your lady to become an Adult Male.</p>
