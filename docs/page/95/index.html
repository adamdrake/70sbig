  <p>I just got this handy camera that I will also use as a coaching tool. It can film stuff at 240 and 600 frames per second. This means that the camera is taking more pictures than the standard 30 or 60 fps, and thus can capture very fast movements (I got it for the Olympic lifts). Unfortunately the 600 fps degrades in quality (the resolution goes down quite a bit), and since the camera is taking so many pictures, you need a pretty hardcore light source to get the most out of it. The 240 fps works pretty well for my purposes in a gym, so I decided to share some of the videos with you after messing around with it on the first day.</p>
<p>It’s pretty sweet to watch the Olympic lifts when they are slowed down, and you can see little deviations in bar movement very well. Sammerr is the subject of our first video — he is a friend of mine that Rip and I have coached since he’s been at the gym. He’s a pretty damn strong 94 kg lifter (I just watched him deadlift 545 for a triple the other day), and was doing some 140 kg cleans. He’s clean and jerked 150 in competition, and these didn’t look particularly hard. His technique is solid in that the bar leaves the floor in a vertical bar path. Also note the shrug at the top of the pull.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2Z9dVgiZGQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>After seeing the video slowed down, we thought it was pretty cool. So Sammerr loaded the bar to 90 kg and did a quick power snatch so we could film it. His form is, again, very solid (we finally got his start position consistent). My only nagging point is that he could have shrugged his shoulders a bit more at the rack, but a solid power snatch. It wasn’t that heavy — Sammerr has snatched 112 in competition and 120 in training. If he keeps pulling the bar vertical like he is here, he’ll easily hit at least 120 in competition.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pd3XToNDrc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>For the hell of it, I also filmed one of my favorite people at the gym, “Peez”. She was power cleaning singles on the minute, so I had lots of footage on her. This was also the first time I coached in real time, then consulted a camera. It’s useful, but I don’t think a coach should be dependent on the camera to verify what’s wrong. Peez has come a long way in the last year and a half and has gotten pretty explosive on her power cleans.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxYmswHlZo0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Follow the jump for a squat video.</p>
<p>And for you non-Olympic lifters, here is a video of my friend Mike squatting 415×5 (the first set of his 5×5 volume day on the Texas Method). This video doesn’t have any sound for some reason, but it is in HD. Key in on the nice bounce Mike has. Mike’s intensity day is hovering around 480 for a triple right now, and I’ve seen him triple 500. He squatted 512 at his last meet. Ignore the width of this video — this was the smallest embed I could use.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8FKSmzQlZdM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>

  <p>I’m not really sure how you could have made it this far and not heard of Ed Coan, but I like how <a href="http://www.tmuscle.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_interviews/atlas_speaks">Joe Koenig</a> introduces to you him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you go to the gym tomorrow, I want you to head to the squat rack and load it up with twenty 45 pound plates. That’s right, put ten on each side. Now just stand back and look at it and try not to pee your pants. Guess what? Ed Coan has squatted about 50 pounds more than that. Over the next week, see how much you can squat for a single rep. Then do the same with the bench press and deadlift. Add those numbers up. If you can squat 500, deadlift 450, and bench 300, well, you’re only at about the halfway point to equaling Ed Coan’s total. Scary, huh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1761" data-permalink="/blog/2010/05/hof-inductee-ed-coan/coansquat/" data-orig-file="/2010/05/coansquat.jpg" data-orig-size="380,271" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="coansquat" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2010/05/coansquat.jpg" data-large-file="/2010/05/coansquat.jpg" src="/2010/05/coansquat.jpg" alt="" title="coansquat" width="380" height="271" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1761" /></p>
<p>Coan has been touted as the “Michael Jordan of powerlifting” because he has set over 100 world records, has won 12 senior national championships, and 12 world championships. He is one of the strongest lifters in history with a PR total of 2,463 lbs while weighing 218. To put this in perspective, Bill Kazmaier’s best total was 2,425 (although it is very important to note that Kaz was in a different era and didn’t wear any gear whatsoever and moved away from powerlifting to have a long and successful career in other strength sports). Coan moved on with the times to compete in single ply gear, but always deadlifts without a suit. His best competition lifts (he doesn’t max out in the gym) are a 1,038 squat, a 578 bench (long arms), and a 901 deadlift — all while weighing under 240 (he’s 5’6″).</p>
<p>Coan describes himself as a “regular guy who lifts a lot of weight”. He started powerlifting as a teenager after seeing Bill Kazmaier on TV. He started lifting in the 75kg/165lb class and moved up to the 110kg/242lb class by the end of his career because he wasn’t interested in cutting weight and wanted a challenge. He set records in five weight classes in his career — a phenomenal feat because he was amazing regardless of what class he lifted in.</p>
<p>Coan’s huge numbers and total instantly put him in the 70’s Big Hall of Fame, but when you consider the fact that he consistently got bigger (as a result of his increasing strength) throughout his career…well, I don’t know another way to demonstrate a 70’s Big mindset. So he’s crazy strong, has had wild success in every single weight class, and also has had a career that lasted<strong>over 25 years</strong> (in a sport that eats people up with injuries), and you have an easy HoF pick. His mantra shows through his numerous interviews: keep it simple, and don’t overtrain since it will limit success and make you injury prone. Even though his career lasted so long, Coan no longer lifts due to an injury he suffered while squatting in competition (avoid watching this video at all costs, it is frightening). While his records will fall with with the prevalence of geared lifting, his legendary achievements will live forever.</p>
<p>Here is a compilation of some of Coan’s lifts. Some highlights include squatting 950 for a double, benching 550 for a double, and doing a behind the neck seated press with 400 lbs. Oh, and it has a pretty sweet song:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/S9L5XJta3Ag?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>

  <p>Meet Brian Drescher, a living legend. I stumbled upon YouTube videos of this guy and was pretty entertained. Unfortunately the guy who uploaded his two best videos put a block on embedding them, so you will have to click them manually.</p>
<p>This guy apparently loves him some Olympic weightlifting. When he hits his lifts, he’ll say things like, “In your face! There it is! Still the king!” so fast you wonder how he was prepared to say it while supporting 100 kilos overhead. The guy must be crazy like <a href="/?p=431">Ricky Bruch</a>, but generally has a jovial disposition (as opposed to Bruch’s ill-tempered nature).</p>
<p>The first video I saw was this one at the 2007 Empire State Games, and it gives you a splash of his personality.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the YouTube account doesn’t allow links to the videos. You can find the account <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/djquntsntl">here</a>, and it is the 2007 Empire State Games video.</p>
<p>But you’ll learn so much more from him in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpBoyb1X8Q0">this next vid</a> (my personal favorite) — he spits out his life philosophy while doing a set of 10 power snatches at 70 kilos (note the “Got Total?” shirt).</p>
<p>Don’t fret, we also have videos of him competing in the 2008 and 2009 Empire State Games. This is a real treat folks, because he is, after all, an American legend.</p>

<h2 id="some-8220must-reads8221">Some “Must Reads”</h2>
<p>70’s Big is a fun little resource for a variety of things, but it isn’t the only lifting site out there. I want to play the part of “RSS for Strength” to highlight a few articles that we’ve enjoyed lately. This should keep you distracted on this glorious Monday.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>The first article is something that all of you novices need to pay attention to (this also includes everybody that weighs under 200 pounds).</p>
<p>From <a href="http://startingstrength.com">StartingStrength.com</a>: <a href="http://startingstrength.com/index.php/site/resources">YNDTP</a> by Mark Rippetoe</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is that you must gain some bodyfat in the process ifyour bodyfat is low, and that you should lose some bodyfat if it is high. I don’t want you fat, but Idon’t care about seeing your abs. If you want to see your abs, fine – worry about that later. I want youto get big by getting stronger, and to do this it may be necessary for your bodyfat percentage to go upin the process. Later, if necessary, the process of losing it can be more easily accomplished when youhave more muscle mass. But right now, just worry about getting <em>strong</em>, and <em>big</em> will be a side-effect, aswill improved body composition. And if you don’t stop misinterpreting this, I will have you all killed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>———-</p>
<p>This website is obviously focused on basing a training (or even exercise) program around the development of strength. <em><a href="http://articles.elitefts.com/articles/iron-brothers/three-more-reasons-why-i-hate-%E2%80%9Cfitness%E2%80%9D/">Tree More Reasons Why I Hate “Fitness”</a></em> by Jason Nunn on <a href="http://elitefts.com">Elite Fitness Systems</a> has a similar mindset, and the dude is peeved with the fitness industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do a Google search for “certified personal trainer,” you’ll find that there are approximately 5,342 personal trainer certifications. Hiring a personal trainer can work great for people who need the accountability and guidance, but I wouldn’t advise hiring a trainer just based on the fact that they’re “certified.” A personal trainer certification is the fitness equivalent of a CPR certification. Just because an individual is CPR certified doesn’t mean they’re a paramedic. The same holds true for trainers. Just because he’s certified doesn’t make him an expert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>———-</p>
<p>One of the best tools you can do for all around conditioning, <em>especially</em> for a strength athlete, is push a <a href="http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?cid=182&amp;m=PD&amp;pid=2294">prowler sled</a> (read what we had to say about it <a href="/?p=1082">here</a>). However, you may not always have a prowler on hand, or you may be a travelin’ man.</p>
<p><a href="http://articles.elitefts.com/articles/training-articles/treadmill-pushing-the-solution-to-the-prowler-less-gym/"><em>Treadmill Pushing: The Solution to the Prowler-less Gym</em></a> by Keir Wehham-Flatt on <a href="http://elitefts.com">Elite Fitness Systems</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…as a freelance trainer working with clients at more than one facility, I often find that time, space, and equipment constraints preclude the use of sled pushing with my clients. I have found treadmill pushing to be a great substitute for sled work on such occasions and have implemented it in my programs over the past year with success.</p>

<p>Oh, and <a href="mailto:70sbig@gmail.com">send in</a> your mustache pics for the May Picture Submission Contest if you want to get in the running for a free 70’s Big shirt. Looks like Tom is gonna win.</p>

<p>I’d like to share a brand new website with you, 70’s Big readers. <a href="http://killustrated.com">Killustrated.com</a> is a website where you can purchase graphic products (posters, shirts, illustrations, etc.) that range from cool lifting shirts, amazing pieces of lifting art, and fantastic anatomical drawings. Whether you are outfitting your home gym, looking for new lifting t-shirts, want some funky art, or are preparing to give lectures in the realm of exercise and/or training, Killustrated is stocked for your needs.</p>
<p>Killustrated is run by <a href="http://killustrated.com/info.html">The Killustrator</a> is “reclusive and eccentric fellow. A moderately accomplished athlete, coach, and art school dropout, he has spent more than two decades researching and teaching anatomy &amp; physiology in a variety of formats.” He knows his stuff, and can portray it very well artistically; a deadly combination.</p>
<p>One piece that I want to highlight is the <a href="http://killustrated.com/pisarenko.html">Pisarenko Poster</a>. Anatoly Pisarenko is one of our 70’s Big co-captains, and the Killustrator has brought out the drama in this classic Bruce Klemens photo of Pisarenko.</p>

<p>This poster is “17×22 inch hand numbered giclee print on archival quality matte media”. I don’t know what the hell that means, but the texture of this “poster” is as thick as a note card, and it has some type of finish on the ink. In other words, it is built to last and is some high quality stuff. I know, because I have one — I have #5 out of 1,000. There will only be 1,000 printings, and after that, they will NOT be reprinted, so if you want one, you better get it now.</p>
<p>When the Killustrator showed me the poster, I couldn’t stop staring at it. It is absolutely beautiful. I’m framing mine and will use it for training motivation.</p>

  <p>I recently hung out with Charles when he came to the WFAC for an interview for the <a href="http://startingstrength.com">Starting Strength</a> website. I was very amused by his demeanor, his wit, and his almost kid-like playfulness. He’s a successful coach and has an emphasis on training like an athlete instead of a stereotypical fitness “exerciser”. You can get a feel for his style on his website, Staley Training Systems, but this anti-exerciser approach is prevalent in the following article that he wrote.</p>

<p><strong>Cheating To Win: Why You Should Take The Path Of Least Resistance</strong></p>
<p>_</p>
<p>by Charles Staley_</p>
<p>Cheating is perhaps the most maligned and least appreciated tactic in the weight room. It’s so important in fact, that I consider cheating to be the calling card of skilled lifters.</p>
<p>When we examine the three primary strength sports (weightlifting, powerlifting, and strongman), it’s clear that cheating is an absolute prerequisite for success. Of the three disciplines, I’d argue that weightlifters have elevated the art of cheating to a sweet science. In fact, during the performance of the two competitive events (the snatch and clean &amp; jerk), lifters violate almost every dearly-held notion in the personal training industry:</p>
<p>• During the “catch” phase of both the snatch and clean, lifters allow their knees to drift significantly in front of the toes.</p>
<p>• During the support phase of the snatch and the jerk, lifters aggressively lock their elbow joints against heavy loads.</p>
<p>• Both the snatch and clean start with what amounts to an accelerative deadlift with a heavy weight.</p>
<p>• In training, weightlifters rarely if ever use spotters— if they get into trouble with a lift, they simply drop the barbell on the floor.</p>
<p>• Both weightlifting events, as well as most of the assistance exercises they use, employ the use of maximum speed against the bar.</p>
<p>• Rather than use common set/rep brackets such as 3×10, 5×8, etc., weightlifters typically use many sets of 1-3 reps per set. Additionally, weightlifters avoid “failure” like Brittney avoids panties.</p>
<p>• Your weightlifting coach will never ask “How did that feeeel?” If your lift looked great, there’s no need to ask how it felt. If it sucked, there’s still no reason to ask.</p>
<p>• Weightlifters don’t do “cardio.” Try a clean &amp; jerking a heavy triple and you’ll find out why.</p>
<p>• Weightlifters don’t lift in front of a mirror.</p>
<p>• Weightlifters, by definition, compete. Few weightlifting clubs will tolerate a lifter who won’t lift in meets. At least, not for long</p>
<p>• Weightlifters squat deep. So deep in fact, that there is a competition rule that forbids the lifter from touching his/her butt to the floor at the bottom of a snatch or clean.</p>
<p>• (Along the lines of the last point) weightlifters often round their low backs at the bottom of their squats. What’s that? You can keep your arch when your butt’s an inch from the floor? Send me the video.</p>
<p>• Weightlifters hold their breath during long portions of most lifts. They never “inhale on the lowering phase” or “exhale on the lifting phase.”</p>
<p>• Both the snatch and the jerk, as well as several assistance exercises for these two lifts) involve putting a barbell over your head.</p>
<p>And finally…</p>
<p>• As a global point, weightlifters seek the easiest way to lift a weight, not the hardest way.</p>
<p>It’s possible that I missed a few points, but I think my central point has been made. Now here’s what’s kinda interesting about all of this…</p>
<p>Most people who lift for the sake of improving their appearance typically try to avoid every one of these maneuvers. Yet, not only do weightlifters violate all of these sacred cows, they actually get better aesthetic results than their “exerciser” counterparts do, despite the fact that they don’t really lift for aesthetic purposes!</p>
<p>Recently I noticed a question on an internet forum from a 24-year old man who wanted to look like a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter, in less than one year, starting from scratch as it were. He got plenty of advice, most of it relating to exercise choices, meal timing, set/rep brackets, and goal setting. My suggestion: if you want to look like an MMA athlete, why not become an (MMA) athlete?</p>
<p>Which of course, is the take-home point of this article. Any takers?</p>

  <p>We all remember that momentous moment in the movie <em>Blood Sport</em> where Chong Li sends Frank Dux’s friend, Ray Jackon, to the hospital on the second day of the highly secretive (and equally illegal) Kurmite:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1j0Loz-JRI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>As you can see, Dux has a front row seat to his friend Ray acting like a stupid American and trying to win the crowd only to find himself getting an Asian curb stomp from Chong Li moments later. On a similar note, Chong Li is probably one of the first Asians to ever have <a href="http://www.completemartialarts.com/whoswho/pictures/images/bolo6.JPG" target="_blank">pecs</a>, and he damn sure is the first one to discover how to use them.</p>
<p>Anyway, Dux’s friend, <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_IL518OY7yDk/ScZexi9LzJI/AAAAAAAAAvA/NQbyJ6QgG5c/s400/cs5.jpg" target="_blank">Kenneth Siu</a> (on right) holds him back while Chong Li strips off the stereotypical Harley Davidson bandana and dangles it above Dux’s head. This isn’t in the official movie script, but I’m pretty sure Kenneth whispers ever so softly into Frank Dux’s ear, “No Frankie, you must live to fight another day…another day.”</p>
<p>And this was excellent advice. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Kumite_bracket.gif" target="_blank">As you can see</a>, Dux would end up fighting four times on the second day of the tournament. A non-sanctioned scuffle with Chong Li would have removed him from competition, and as my friend Brent always says, “This is competition!” (whatever that means).</p>
<p>You see, if Frank Dux had attacked Chong Li at this pivotal point, it not only would have ruined this classic 80’s fight movie, but it would have failed to teach the lesson of patience. There are times when the benefits do not outweigh the cost, and becoming aware of these moments is important for your short and long-term training career. If your body is in a weakened state, it is best not to train heavy and hard unnecessarily.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I did not heed the advice of Kenneth Siu. I traveled back into town on a Monday and attempted to go through my normal volume day on the Texas Method (5×5 squatting, and I think it was 430) on Tuesday. My back was very tired and weak from the constant sitting, and I pulled something at the bottom of a squat on the second set. I remember completing the rep, screaming through the excruciating pain (I wasn’t about to drop the 430 lbs on my spotters), and falling to a knee after racking it. I wasn’t able to squat for almost two months, and it put quite a damper in my training.</p>
<p>Now fast forward to last week. I went through a lengthy rehab process and am finally training without pain. The week before I squatted 495 for a triple, and 500 was on the agenda. However, my body didn’t feel up to snuff for Monday’s volume day. My immune system had some severe trouble with allergies (the crew at Amarillo may have noticed this at the first 70’s Big Workshop – I was being hit pretty hard that day but still tried to perform well enough), and my body didn’t feel recovered. I ended up taking the day off to prevent an injurous situation. I still wanted to get my intensity day in on Thursday for a few reasons, but mainly because it was the last day of the week my schedule would permit me to train. So on Tuesday I had a make shift volume day (ascending sets of five reps for four sets), and then came in on Thursday and completely annihilated 500 for a triple (I considered going for a fourth rep).</p>
<p>This story isn’t being told to tell you of my accomplishment, but instead about the mistake I made a few months ago. I hurt my back when I was in a vulnerable state. Having the “stick to the program or die” mentality can really hamper training, and it fucked mine up for a while. Life happens and you need to start learning how to adapt your program to these happenings so that you can continue getting stronger. You will have a much bigger payoff in the long run, just like Frank Dux.</p>
<p>Dux waited patiently for his chance. And he finally got it when he faced Chong Li in the final battle.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='329' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wpVAdA7Oo0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>For those of you who don’t want to watch drawn out affair of Van Damme yelling and flexing, Dux eventually forces Chong Li to say matté to win the tournament, even when blinded (and throwing “90 degree punches”, as Brent says – see 3:07). I have it on good authority that this is the Asian word for “uncle”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: So, is matté the Asian word for uncle?</p>
<p>Brent: I think so.</p>
<p>Me: QED</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, Dux decided to be patient and begin the fight his own terms. If I know my 80’s movies, his emotions would have gotten the best of him had he attacked Chong Li immediately after Ray Jackson headbutted Li’s foot. Dux’s dilemma is analogous to being improperly prepared for training because you are weak and not feeling your best. Trust me, you don’t want to go through a two month recovery period. Just be smart and patient in order to stay injury free, and this will yield more efficient strength gains. Learn from my mistake instead of yours. Most of all, learn from Frank Dux.</p>

  <p>I got to the gym late today, so I didn’t realize Justin was out. Sorry.</p>
</br>
<p>Thanks to all who participated in the TSC. Thanks to Antigen for compiling <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tWmGqMRiaA7pxBHRgBlhLPQ&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html">results</a>.</p>
</br>
<p>It was a good first outing. I’m pleased to report that all the guys pulled at least three wheels and most weighed in &gt;200 (JasonR didn’t but kicked almost everyone’s ass anyway).</p>
</br>
<p>A special shout-out to the three ladies who competed. They deadlifted 225, 275, and 305, with Heidi adding 13 pullups and 100 snatches. Solid, solid performance.</p>
</br>
<p>This month is going to be the Total 225 Challenge. The format is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Squat 225 for max reps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bench 225 for max reps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadlift 225 for max reps</p>
</li>
</ul>
</br>
<p>Squats are full depth (crease of hip below top of knee). Bench presses must touch the chest then be locked out at the top. DLs should be done with iron if possible. You can touch and go, but NO BOUNCING (that’s you, crossfitters). DL stops when you let go of the bar or take more than 3 seconds between attempts. No straps.</p>
</br>
<p>This can be scaled if necessary. Women can do, I don’t know, 135? (Somebody suggest something here).</p>
</br>
<p>Males-in-training can do 185. But really, you need to get at least one damn rep with 2 plates per. It is your destiny.</p>
</br>
<p>Here is your inspiration:</p>
