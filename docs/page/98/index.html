<p>Skinny Guy, I want you to know that <a href="/?p=1158">I care</a>. I pity you.</p>
<p>I pity your cute little legs and your hunched shoulders. You hunch them so that you can flex your trunk easier in order to continuously flex your abs. A whimsical breeze could hit you at an angle that would knock your shirt clean off! If you can’t dazzle them with size, then cut their pupils with your 1280×1024 resolution abs.</p>
<p>Alas! Your abominable abdominals don’t have much utility outside of a non-hetero vampire movie. But don’t worry, Uncle Justin wants what’s best for you. I want you to be strong so that <del datetime="2010-04-08T04:47:23+00:00">if</del> when the inevitable zombie outbreak or nuclear holocaust occurs (whichever comes first), then you’ll be of some use to the rest of us.</p>
<p>“How can I do it? I have gone so many years without consuming a solid meal that I don’t know where to begin!” I hear your plight, Skinny Guy. Luckily, mainstream media is here to the rescue. They took time out of their busy schedule of updating us on American Idol and verbally performing fellatio on the head of the state to teach Skinny Guy <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/04/07/fast.food.calories/index.html?hpt=C1">what to eat</a>.</p>

<p>The bun-free (“so meaty, there’s no room”) sandwich features two pieces of bacon, two slices of melted cheese and “Colonel’s Sauce” – which KFC officials said is a “zesty mayonnaise” — slathered between two chicken filets, either original recipe (540 calories and 32 fat grams per KFC.com) or the slightly slimmer grilled version (460 calories and 23 fat grams).</p>

<p>Look at that, Skinny Guy. This is your density! Or something…</p>
<p>I especially like how the Chicken Ranch Taco Salad at Taco Bell weighs in at 910 calories and is apparently the second most caloric item on the menu. I also love how all of the blogs around the country are flipping their shit over this, as if caloric food is <a href="/?page_id=7">something</a> <a href="http://thisiswhyyourefat.com/">new</a>. The stupid-ass Huffington Post says they are “going too far” (Fun Fact of the Day: The Huffington Post linked to 70’s Big at the end of last year…well, okay, someone in the comments linked to us, but I found it amusing nonetheless). Everyone will try to shame the KFC, but I will stand against convention and tyranny and say, “Thank you, KFC, for caring about all of the Skinny Guys out there. You make my job easier.”</p>

  <p>Look, I know a lot of you are training out of CrossFit facilities. There ain’t nothin’ wrong with that. But, most people wanting to get better at doing CrossFit stuff will do so by getting stronger. This isn’t new, we’ve been saying it for a while. It may not be in everyone’s best interest to weigh 260+ and be a lifter. That is okay, although the lot of you guys reading the site are horrendously underweight, regardless if you compete in anything or not.</p>
<p>My friend Gant moved up a weight class in Judo (from 90kg to 100kg) and has won his last two tournaments. The point is that he maintains a bodyweight below 220, but still has the 70’s Big mindset. He strength trains properly and conditions very well for his sport. Oh, and he also eats like a man should: heartily. Actually being big enough to be considered 70’s Big will not be in everyone’s best interest, but the quest of 70’s Big is one that aims to get stronger and improve.</p>
<p>“The Scott” is a good example of this. He’s a guy who got involved with CrossFit after a period of dicking around in gyms, and then got pretty damn strong by lifting and drinking his milk. Recently he competed in two CrossFit competitions; he weighed 215 for the first, and then 205 for the second. During one of these he was interviewed by a camera crew, and they asked him a series of questions. When they finally asked about his beard, Scott replied, “It’s all about 70s Big, bulking, chocolate milk and lifting heavy.” Scott is a patriot.</p>
<p>Oh, for those of you who were upset to see him lose ten pounds, he told me in the e-mail, “I am glad that I’m going back to strength training and minimal [conditioning]. This winter my goal is to [weigh] 225 lbs, a 500 deadlift, 450 squat, 400 bench press, 250 press, and 270 clean and jerk.”</p>
<p>In any case, Scott is a guy who really found his niche by going through CF first. CF can be a gateway to lots of competitive endeavors, yet I still stand by the statement that hardly any people that “do CrossFit” put their necks out on the line to actually compete, and this is an integral part to the whole “70’s Big thing”. If you aren’t interested in powerlifting competitions, or you are unable to get into weightlifting, that is fine. But it is in your best interest to pick something, train for it, and compete in it. You’ll learn more about yourself than you would by just dicking around and hoping you’ll get good at something. Figure it out.</p>

<p>70’s Big TSC</p>
<p>A lot of you are sacking up and competing in something this month. If you’re still on the fence, you are <del datetime="2010-04-07T11:56:41+00:00">invited</del> required to participate in the Tactical Strength Challenge this month.</p>
<p>The events are simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Max deadlift. You get three attempts to find your max pull. Do it meet-style. If you make an “AC-jump” between your first and second attempt, there is no going back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max pullups. Dead hangs. No chinning (palms must face away), and absolutely no kipping. Kippers will be shot, killed, and then banned from posting here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 min Kettlebell snatch test. 24kg kettlebell. Unlike GS, you may set the weight down or switch hands as necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it, three events. Perform these in one session, and rest at least 15 minutes between each even (or more if you have time). Perform the TSC the last week of April and post your results on the last Saturday of April (I’ll make a weekend post for it). Good luck!</p>
<p>For more info, go <a href="http://www.tacticalstrengthchallenge.com/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>_Edit: After posting this part this morning, I got an email from <a href="http://www.kettlebellathleticsblog.com/">Kettlebell Athletics</a> about the kettlebell snatch. Jason is a good dude, and he puts out a nice newsletter. Today’s topic is how not to bang your wrist while doing KB snatches, a big problem with beginners. If you’re new to this exercise, check out this video and practice your technique before doing the TSC. I also recommend wearing wrist bands the first few times out.</p>
<p>The video is <a href="http://www.kettlebellathleticsblog.com/2010/04/07/kettlebell-snatches-how-to-not-bang-your-wrist/">here</a>._</p>

  <p>The following was written by <a href="http://www.startingstrength.com/resources/forum/showthread.php?t=11245&amp;page=38">Gary Gibson</a>. Do a search if you’re interested in reading his past entries.</p>
<p><strong>First Day at the Beach in a Long, Long Time</strong></p>
<p>Some of you reading this have probably seen my very first post in these pages, which included a picture of me in my early teens (I appreciate the donations you then sent to my food fund). That picture was taken at New Smyrna Beach roughly 20 years ago. In fact it’s been damn near 20 years since I’d set a foot on the beach till yesterday. Got a little bit of sunburn (apparently my menalin levels only confer resistance–not invulnerability–to UV damage), but more germane to the readership of this site is that I was about 60 lbs heavier than the last time I bared my nearly nude body for such wide public viewing. Yesterday’s return to the beach also coincided with my crossing the 190-lb barrier on the scale for the first time.</p>
<p>Let me qualify this. All the many years I spent being disturbingly skinny, I was actually proud of my disturbing skinniness. I’d whooped with joy when I discovered “Muscle &amp; Fitness” at the age of 15 because I’d found a magazine that celebrated the 90’s smallness into which I hoped to grow. I loved the fact that I had razor sharp abs, even if they came at the cost of emaciation. So even though I now care more performance than appearance, it was a little weird to have so many people see me with that much fat around my midsection. I’ve had time to get used to it when alone and nekkid, but that was the first time my powerlifter’s mono-ab and burgeoning love handles were on public display.</p>
<p>Very happy to report that I didn’t feel the urge to start a conditioning blitz to get “beach pretty”, that on balance I much preferred having the extra muscle and fat, and that I care far, far more about hitting a 500-lb squat at the Raw Nationals this summer than getting a narrower midsection.</p>
<p>Like I said, I just crossed that 190-lb barrier on the scale. I’m pretty confident I’ll cross the 200-lb threshold to male adulthood before the month is out. In fact, I’m pretty sure I’ll have to cut a little bit to compete in the 90 kg class in July. The cut may result in a tighter midsection after I’ve put on another ten pounds of muscle and I may even go back to the beach. This time, I’ll wear sunblock.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>It is important to note that Gary is not a novice, yet he is growing like one. He places performance ahead of appearance right now, and this is what a real athlete will do. Now, just because Gary perceives himself as fat does not actually mean he is (I’d personally like to see a picture of this new bodyweight, no homo, because I don’t trust a guy’s opinion on how fat he is when he’s been skinny his whole life, even if it <em>is</em> Gary Gibson), nor does it mean he is stuck with it.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>growing into a weight class</strong>, and Gary will get to the point where he will fill out his frame near the top end of whatever his desired weight class is. He will continue getting more muscle as he continues to get stronger, and he eventually will have to cut to lift in this weight class. Age, genetics, and a bunch of other shit will decide how lean he will be at his “walking weight” (the weight he will walk around at before he cuts to meet weight requirements), but he will undoubtedly be more muscular with less fat than he is now. And perhaps it will let him prowl the beach with his chin a bit higher.</p>

  <p>My friends Ryan and Heidi at Amarillo Strength and Conditioning hosted their first powerlifting meet back on March 13th. If I recall correctly, they were looking to get the event sanctioned, but by doing so it would have delayed the date. They just wanted to have a competition, and they weren’t worried about it being officially official, at least this first time out.</p>
<p>They had 20 people participate and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkd-PbPMQ-I">Neil Eddins</a>, who holds some national Masters powerlifting <a href="http://www.texaslifting.com/American%20World%20Records/American%20Men%20PL.htm">records</a> in NASA, stopped by to help out. The meet went well, and they had a lot of their lifters set PR’s, and they raised some money for the Rockwell Road Baptist Church Children’s Ministry.</p>
<p>I commend the Amarillo SC crew for having this meet for a few reasons. First, it got a lot of their lifters to lift in a meet environment. This is good for the lifter and coach, and everyone learns from doing it. The lifter learns all that <a href="/?p=1111">stuff</a> about themselves, the coach learns all kinds of stuff about handling lifters at the meet, and then the meet director learns about running a meet — all important things to learn if you’re going to be involved in this kind of stuff. Some of you may be thinking, “Well, it wasn’t sanctioned, so it doesn’t count, so what’s the point?” I think it’s good that they ran a meet once before they did it for real. This way they won’t screw up the official one, they’ll have the experience, and they will be ready for it. It was also a nice, harmless way to introduce their lifters into competition since they didn’t have to travel away from their own gym, and probably didn’t have to pay a bunch of money for something that they hadn’t done before.</p>
<p>In any case, everything went well, according to Ryan when we talked about it. I’ve never been to Amarillo SC, but Ryan frequents the comments and always has good things to say about their lifters. I will be visiting <a href="http://amarillosc.com">Amarillo SC</a> on April 24th for the first <strong>70’s Big Workshop</strong> (more on this tomorrow). Below are the top finishers in the two weight classes per gender (they had light and heavy weights) as well as a video compilation (Ryan apologizes for some sideways shots, it was his first video — oh and the high squats were red lighted, so don’t worry about bitching about them).</p>

<p>Dang, some of you are too gullible. In fact, did you know gullible is not even in the dictionary? Look it up if you don’t believe me.</p>
<p>In any case, it’s PR Friday. Post your weight lifted, consumed, or gained, and also post all of the temperamental moments you had when someone pulled an April Fool’s joke on you.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/users/Spencer%20Hall">Spencer Hall</a> from SB Nation is known as “The Amateur”, the guy who can’t do anything as good as those who can. Well, recently he shot up to Charlotte to witness his first powerlifting meet. This was the “Battle of the Border” meet that AC competed in a few weekends ago. Spencer <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2010/3/31/1396177/mustache-weekend-part-two-powerlifting">wrote an article</a> for the SB Nation readers who are more than likely not familiar with powerlifting. He highlights AC quite a bit, and there’s a pretty funny video at the end. Even if he didn’t talk about my pal Ace, I still would enjoy this article — Spencer had me laughing my ass off. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately…a mustache <em>[that Spencer is wearing</em>] brands you as:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a.) A gregarious pedophile</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>b.) A new expat from the Middle East</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>c.) A misplaced fisherman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>d.) Nick Offerman, also known as Ron Swanson on NBC’s hit sitcom Parks and Recreation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is an exchange between Spencer and AC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I ask him how much his hair is worth on a lift.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The hair? Oh, that’s ten pounds, easy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The beard is five, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Definitely. And you have to wear the singlet. This one is my dad’s. His balls were in this singlet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He wears a look of pride on his face as he says this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Singlets are cool. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is very fucking funny, and Spencer has a nice little description of an outsider’s view of a powerlifting meet. We’ll probably hear from him again in the future.</p>

<p>Hey, maybe I’ve been to hard on the skinny guys. Whatever you want to do in order to be happy, you should do it. If you want to shave your chest, maintain some sexy abs, and pull in the ladies, then why not, eh? Nothin’ wrong with tryin’ to impress the ladies, right?</p>
<p>Look, we don’t need to eat all of this food. We can get BIG, and we can get <strong>strong</strong> if we eat healthy (it may take 10 years to increase your lean body mass by five pounds, but hey, slow and steady wins the race, knowhatImean?). I challenge each and everyone one of you to get a healthy serving of green vegetables today — THREE TIMES!! I think it’s time we start focusing on our health. After all, if you eat like we have been recommending for six months, then you’ll turn into a swarthy, obese, unhealthy mother fucker who isn’t very useful. By GOD, my friend Zach, the internet phenomenon, is SUCH a fat boy.</p>
<p>The 70’s Big stance is now one that revolves around lookin’ good and feelin’ good. Here is my 6 step program:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eat less red meat. It has all kinds of things in it that you don’t need, especially if you are hitting glutes and cardio five days a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three servings of vegetables a day keeps you slim, trim, with abs as sharp as a pin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cycle your abdominal exercises throughout the week so that you don’t exhaust one ab. If you want at least a six pack, then you better hit each pack by itself lest it shall be overtrained and grow angry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take your shirt off around other guys. It shows that you are okay with your sexuality and will be the primary method in finding a mate in the proximity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat protein, but not too much. You can’t assimilate all of if anyway, and you don’t want it stored as excess fat!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy a mirror — two if you can. You should monitor your progress frequently. If your abs aren’t smashing diamonds in two, then you better sharpen your game, son.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>But in all seriousness guys, it’s time to start lookin’ good and feelin’ good. Mmmm…can you smell it?</p>

  <p>I started a little series called <a href="/?p=1410">Your First Weightlifting Meet</a> that went into detail how a trainee should prepare for their first Olympic Weightlifting meet. I will follow up that post with some general stuff you should know about the meet itself. There will also be a powerlifting version of this post, and it will be either written by or commented by my friends (and powerlifting veterans) <a href="http://www.raw-strength.net/">Andy</a> <a href="http://www.startingstrength.com/resources/forum/showthread.php?t=8331&amp;page=71">Baker</a> and <a href="http://www.startingstrength.com/resources/forum/showthread.php?t=13918&amp;page=12">Phil Stevens</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I’m just going to give very general guidelines for competing in either sport. This will not be comprehensive on purpose as it will help you start thinking about what will happen on meet day.</p>
<p><strong>Get Someone To Handle You</strong></p>
<p>No, they aren’t going to have their hands all over you, pervert. “Handling” someone at a meet means you are their platform coach, and you will be dictating their attempts. If you are going into your first meet, it would be preferable to have an experienced lifter helping you out. I understand that this is a luxury for most people, but if you can weasle your way into it, your experience will be profoundly different.</p>
<p>A good platform coach will count your attempts (weightlifting) and/or know where you stand in your flight (powerlifting). They can update you on this knowledge so that you know when to hit your warm-ups in the warm-up room, or they will even dictate your warm-ups. They will be your objective friend, deciding what jumps you should make in your subsequent attempts. If this is someone that has been working with you, they will also be able to help out with your technique. In other words, having a platform coach will make you feel better. I’ve been fortunate enough to coach with and be coached by Rippetoe at meets. He is very good at challenging his lifters when they need an extra kick in the ass. My friend <a href="http://blackirongym.com/">Josh Wells</a> has helped me out a lot as well, and I don’t know if I would have had the small amount of success I have had without them.</p>
<p><strong>Be Smart</strong></p>
<p>Choose an easy opener, especially on your opening lift of the competition. You should gracefully execute your first snatch and you should fucking annihilate your first squat. This will set the tone for the rest of your day. You will do something that <strong>you know you can do.</strong> This means you are hitting a routine snatch — something you’ve done in training plenty of times. In powerlifting, this should be something you <em>know</em> you could do for a triple. You want it to be easy so that you get on the board. If you bomb out (or miss all of your attempts on that lift), then you don’t total. Trust me, you don’t want this to happen.</p>
<p>Your second attempt can match a gym PR so that you can bring your competition total up. The third attempt should be your PR attempt. If you play it smart, then you’ll add to your total with each lift. Your goal in your first meet should be to go 6 for 6 in weightlifting and 9/9 in powerlifting. This means you’ll play it a bit conservative, but this is fine in your first meet. It leads me to my next point…</p>
<p><strong>Have Fun</strong></p>
<p>For fuck’s sake, you’re in your first lifting meet. You don’t want to go home disappointed, so purposely set yourself to enjoy it. You want to walk away <em>knowing</em> that there was more weight on the bar. If this happens, then you’ll already be thinking about PR’ing at the next meet. You’ll feel so razzed and accomplished. This is what is supposed to happen. The last thing you want is for your first meet to turn into a shit storm. So be conservative with your attempts. Open with something that is painstakingly easy. It should be so easy your teeth hurt. Do something moderate on the second attempt. This means that you would have had to have done it before. Third attempts are when you do something hard. Stick to this template. Have fun. For fuck’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>Weight</strong></p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Don’t cut weight. That’s silly. You don’t need one more thing to worry about if this is your first meet. If you think you are going to be competitive in a certain weight class, then you will deal with that later. Just sign up for the meet, don’t worry about your body weight, lift well, and then take stuff like this into consideration. Don’t be silly, just set yourself to have a good day.</p>
<p>The previously mentioned Andy Baker will also talk about how a novice would tailor their linear progression to get ready for a meet, so stay tuned for that.</p>

  <p>Yesterday’s polls will, at the very least, make good conversation material. I don’t necessarily know if the polls are a good indicator of the entire readership on 70’s Big, but they are at least a glimpse. We have to make a lot of assumptions in order to generalize; did I word the questions properly (probably not), did you interpret them correctly (unlikely), did you answer them truthfully (erroneous), and if the sample size is indicative of the entire readership (who knows?).</p>
<p>In any case, there are some telling results.</p>
<p><strong>70’s Big Is A Sausage Party</strong></p>
<p>I blame this on all of you. I try to reach out to females, really, I do. I do it at the gym too, but the truth is, there aren’t going to be a lot of girls coming into the WFAC, and not a lot of girls are going to accidentally coming across 70’s Big either.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I don’t prefer sausage parties. It’s not a homophobic thing, it’s just that I’d prefer to have some gals hanging out too. This means that you, the guy who is more likely to be reading this, must chat to your girlfriend, your wife, your lady friends, your cleaning lady — whatever — about strength training. My main goal isn’t to get more females reading the site; I just want more of them to get stronger. Everyone likes progress, and this means more strong. It also means a nice lookin’ butt, and this is a win-win for everyone. So, either you have to talk to them about strength training, or send them to someone who can teach them, because letting anyone grow up thinking that 30 minutes on the elliptical is going to yield sexiness and longevity is gonna be bad news bears for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>We Are Mostly Young People</strong></p>
<p>I consider someone in their thirties young. They think they are old. I don’t really think thirty-something is old, because I sure as hell am not going to think my life is nearing its end when I’m thirty. My friend Scott in Washington state is in his forties, and he is probably the most enthusiastic guy on a quest to 70’s Bigdom. In any case, a lot of us are young. We have the potential to influence a generation of popular culture that has taught the country that <a href="http://www.shockya.com/news/new_moon_edward_shirtless9.jpg">emaciated</a> is not only okay, but what is desirable. And this is what we’re up against, my friends.</p>
<p>Gant just sent me a picture of someone in the airport, a poor guy wearing skinny jeans. Gant was most displeased with this display of societal influence (except he said something about a person like that should get gender reassignment therapy), and I’m upset that a guy thinks that being obscenely skinny is okay. I’m not saying that everyone is going to weigh 225, but men don’t weigh 150 pounds. Period.</p>
<p><strong>But 70’s Big Readers Need To Grow</strong></p>
<p>Half of the dudes who voted on their weight are less than 200 pounds. It’s not like people who read 70’s Big are all 5’6″ or shorter, so this needs to be addressed. I want you all stronger. If you are going to really achieve some potential in strength, you will need to gain some muscular bodyweight. Jeez, you guys who are less than 200 pounds seem like you’re mad at me for wanting to help you get strong.</p>
<p>Adult Males &gt; 200 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Someone Did Something Wrong</strong></p>
<p>Either you guys didn’t know how to train until recently, or your training sucked. If you have been training for at least one year, and you weigh less than 200 pounds, then something is fucked (females, the few of you are excluded from this comment). Get your muscular bodyweight up, and then address your bodyfat if you want. But if you’re one of these guys running around the internet claiming that gaining a little bit of fat with a lot of muscle is bad, then you’re just as much a goober as the stooges that say you should never wear a belt. Do a proper program while eating like we tell you and you will grow into a muscular behemoth.</p>
<p><strong>Most Of You Are At Least Sorta Serious</strong></p>
<p>The majority of voters have a tangible training log. This is good. The internet won’t always be available, especially when the zombie outbreak occurs. The few of you that don’t have a training log aren’t training, you’re fucking around. Decide if you want to get stronger. Decide if you want to be muscular. Females, decide if you want to get stronger. Decide if you want a nice butt. Barbell training and food can give it to you.</p>

<p>Well, there are lots of things to announce on this <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fribbling">fribbling</a> Friday, so let’s get on with the bloody thing.</p>
<p><strong>1. New T-shirt…BAM!</strong></p>
<p><a href="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2.png"><img data-attachment-id="1467" data-permalink="/blog/2010/03/bam/logo-shirt-2/" data-orig-file="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2.png" data-orig-size="1200,1163" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="logo-shirt-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2-400x387.png" data-large-file="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2-1024x992.png" src="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2-400x387.png" alt="" width="400" height="387" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1467" srcset="/2010/03/logo-shirt-2-400x387.png 400w, /2010/03/logo-shirt-2-1024x992.png 1024w, /2010/03/logo-shirt-2.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>The image was dictated to my new pal Al Viquez, who until recently was a graphic designer in the videogame industry. He belted out a draft, and it was damn near perfect. A few adjustments later and we have this sweet, succulent image that bleeds 70’s Big. The t-shirt will be going to print in a day or so. There are also four other t-shirts that will be announced soon.</p>

<p><strong>2. WFAC Training Camp</strong></p>
<p>We still have some spots open for the group training package Josh Wells and I are hosting at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club (a shrine of sorts). Coached training sessions include all of the barbell lifts: squat, press, deadlift, bench press, power clean, power snatch, snatch, and clean and jerk (along with assistance exercises). For more information, go <a href="/?page_id=1415">here</a> or <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">e-mail me</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. PR Friday</strong></p>
<p>Post your weights lifted, consumed, or gained to the comments. We also like silly stories about lifting spouses, tossing children, and ripping clothing.</p>
<p><strong>4. Online Programming</strong></p>
<p>70’s Big will now be offering online programming to monitor your training regime and gear it towards whatever your goals are. Do you train on your own and don’t know what to do when your deadlift peters out while your squat rages on? Are you trying to figure out a way to include some conditioning for your rugby season, judo match, mountain bike race, football season, deployment date, etc. into your strength program? Need the advice of experienced coaches? All of those shenanigans and more with a month-to-month subscription of help for under $100. Oh, and form checks are inherent to make sure you are doing the program properly.Shoot me an e-mail</a> to learn more, and stay tuned for further information on the site.</p>
