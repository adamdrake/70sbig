<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/8743132">WFAC Virtual Tour</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user802431">A.C.</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year I’ve had the pleasure of training at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club. As you can see in the video above, the gym is stocked full of squat racks, barbells, plates, and conditioning equipment — it’s a training paradise. I guess you could say that I’ve been spoiled and I’ve forgotten how bad it can be for <a href="/?p=1274">some people</a>. In reality, you can’t get effective training done in an ineffective facility. How many of you are stuck in a shitty training facility? What if there was a facility five miles away that you never knew about? What if you were that facility’s owner and you were missing out on some potential business and/or lifters?</p>
<p>Well, this is where we come in. We are now taking applications from gym owners to be included in our <strong>Gym Directory</strong>. In your application you will need to submit a list of your equipment, pictures of the equipment and facility, as well as contact information. As of now there is not an objective criteria to be included in this directory, but it should be considered an honor because only the finest training facilities will be accepted.</p>
<p>Some basic requirements (that are subject to change) will be decent bars, squat racks, benches, and plates. There is no square footage requirement, and ideally these facilities should be commercially available (in other words, you training alone in your garage doesn’t count). The credentials of the gym owner or coach should also be included so that folks browsing the directory will know what crowd the facility caters to (i.e. beginners, experienced lifters, or both) and what sports they can get involved with (Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, etc.). As we induct more gyms to our directory, I’m sure there will be some kind of form to fill out, but as for now, stick to the information above.</p>
<p>The goal here is to provide a very useful and comprehensive directory for gyms around the country so that people can find a proper gym to train properly in. Gym owners will get more exposure to their websites and facilities, readers of this site will be able to find gyms wherever they live or if they are on the road traveling, and we all help each other get stronger. Fuckin’ A.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p><em>Update, as of 7:53 AM CST</em></p>
<p>Concise list of requirements and info to send in:</p>
<p>– Decent bars, plates, squat racks, and benches (bars and plates must be identified by brand and model)</p>
<p>– Commercially available facilities only</p>
<p>– Credentials of the gym owner or coach</p>
<p>– What kind of crowd does your facility cater to (beginners, experienced lifters, etc.)?</p>
<p>– What sports trainees can get involved with (Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, throwing, judo, etc.)?</p>
<p>– Open gym/personal training only/class only?</p>
<p>And be sure to include:</p>
<p>– pictures of your facility</p>
<p>– your website URL and public contact information</p>
<p>– list of equipment</p>

<p>Charles Staley continues to bring useful information to the internet training community with this new audio interview. Charles, a funny guy, good coach, and new friend of mine, plays the part of moderator in a discussion about programming with a panel of the following top-notch coaches: Pavel Tsatsouline, John Godina, Mark Rippetoe, and Yosef Johnson. That’s a pretty stellar cast, and I’m sure it will be very interesting (I’m in the midst of listening). <a href="http://attendthisevent.com/?eventID=11913519">Click here</a> to listen.</p>

  <p>The server is still turning over. I work on a different computer at night, and for whatever reason when I work on that computer, it represents the database before it was pulled. That means that the post I typed and scheduled to post at midnight never seemed to exist. I’m not technical enough to explain it, but it’ll take a few days to finalize, so stay patient.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Re-typed the post below.</em></p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>No, that doesn’t say “uplifting music”, it says “lifting music”. We all know the benefit of listening to music as we train; it can help improve our mood, energize us, and sometimes induce an adrenaline response. At some powerlifting meets (I assume this is dependent on the federation? Somebody chime in here) there is even music allowed while lifting. In comparison, music is not present in weightlifting meets.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are lots of people interested in what you listen to when you train. It might be kinda cool if you explain a little bit about the song(s) that you list. I always liked to squat to things like “Achilles Last Stand” or “When the Levee Breaks” by Led Zeppelin, as well as “I’m A Man” by Chicago. Let us know what you like.</p>
<p>And here are some (in)famous videos that depict some music that may or may not be playing during training sessions in a certain group of friends (the first two are pretty old, the last is marvelous).</p>

  <p><strong>USAPL Battle on the Border Recap</strong></p>
<p>I was looking forward to this meet for a while since it is only the second USAPL meet I’ve been in. The week prior to the meet was my spring break, so my friends and I went to my Lakehouse, A.K.A. Dickhouse. It was dubbed “Dickhouse” due to the large amounts of sausage that were present the first few times. I spent the week maxin’, relaxin’, and tryin’ to eat as much as I could. On Friday my friend Dylan, who was also at the Dickhouse, and I started our drive up to Charlotte. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LdDf9Z_B8">69</a> miles out Dylans car decides to break down around six o’clock. After this point everything that could gowrong WENT WRONG. The car broke down, then we had to get a tow truck to tow the car to a shop (which was closed), then we got a taxi to the closest rental car place — which happened to be the Greenville, SC airport, then we finished the drive up to Charlotte. In other words, it was the worst fucking day of my life. I fell asleep that night a little after midnight.</p>

    Second attempt squat
  </p>
</div>
<p>The morning of the meet Pat (another friend who would also compete in the meet), Dylan, and I ate some quick breakfast and were on our way. I will give you guys the recap of what happened to me, I won’t do Pat or Dylan any justice if I try to tell their story. So I went and weighed in and took care of some loose ends and I started to warm up. My dad drove up to the meet and gave me some encouragement in the warm-up room. As I warmed up the people at the meet couldn’t have been any nicer. All of the guys there were very respectful and courteous. My first attempt was 505. I have found the first squat of the meet is the most nerve-racking, but I got my first attempt no problem. The second attempt was at 534. I got real amped up for this one. Usually when I get ready for a max effort lift I begin to tear up before I approach the bar because of the adrenaline. One of the judges said that I had the most passion there for squatting. I nailed it. It felt easier than 505. My “limitless reserves of strength” gave me the courage to go for 570. With my dad saying go for it I decided to go big. Well I got into the bottom of the squat, got on my toes, and failed it miserably. Realistically I could have gotten around 555, but I went for the big number instead. Woops. </p>

    First bench attempt
  </p>
</div>
<p>2 hours later after the Bench Only flights (which I am not a fan of) went, I was ready to blast my pecs. My opener was 358. My previous 1 RM was 368 and I crushed 358 like it was no problem. The next lift was 385. It felt really heavy. I got it about half way back up and my arms gave out. I attempted it again, but I just knew it wasn’t gonna happen. I wasn’t too excited to bench at this meet because in training my bench was around the same as my last meet. I had to reset it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKZu0lIDrzA">But the shopowner and his son</a>… that’s a different story altogether. I had to beat them to death with their own shoes. Nasty business, really. But, sure enough, I went on to the best lift ever. The deadlift.</p>
<p>Eight hours had gone by since my first squat attempt. I think everyone there was exhausted. I hit 562 pretty smoothly. I proceeded to go for 585 and failed it on two attempts. The third attempt actually came up higher than the first one. The meet was over. I didn’t do as well as I hoped with a total of 1,455, but I still won my division. I was so excited to show off my 70’s big shirt to the crowd to get in some free advertising, but instead in the locker room peeing into a cup while a grown man looked over my shoulder at my tiny dong. I was lucky enough to be drug tested. I came back up to find out that I had won first place. I gave a nice little cheer. I was happy. The end.</p>

    ...nailed it
  </p>
</div>
<p>———-</p>
<p>So, essentially, AC had a weird meet. The week leading up to the meet may not have been ideal for eating and lifting, and then the day before the meet was a complete disaster. This battle of the border meet was quite popular, especially with the Bench Only division. It apparently took over three hours to get through all of the benching. Furthermore, it is hard to coach yourself on your attempts, and one should be more conservative than not. Because of the large jumps that were made, AC was unable to have some big PR’s like he is capable of doing — he will turn some heads at his next competition, I’m sure. Nevertheless, he still did well and won his division. And I’m proud of him, because he’s my beeeeeeest friiiiieeeeeend.</p>
<p>A guy named Steve that AC met at the meet (who also competed) was kind enough to film, edit, and post his lifts on YouTube. Thanks, Steve.</p>

  <p>Some of you are probably wondering why the site isn’t updated. Well, the site got moved over to another server, so anything that was posted since the database was pulled is not currently here. That means some of the comments that some of you posted won’t be here, and that also means that the post I wrote last night (like a frickin’ bonehead — I forgot about the database) are not up.</p>
<p>The good news is that the apostrophe problem is now nonexistant. On the old server, when you typed a single right quote mark, as in the word don’t, it would show up as don”t. For some reason that could not be fixed on the old server, and it also prevented newer versions of Word Press to be installed. In any case, now I don’t have to type in the HTML manually for a single right quote, and you don’t have to be irritated by it in the comments.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
<p>_Edit: I’m just going to wait until tomorrow to post.</p>

<p>This is a re-post of something I wrote back in October. A lot of you noobs may not have seen it, so I wanted to bring it to light. I plan on updating this list next Friday. You may make suggestions, but do not assume your suggestion is 70’s Big creed. Oh, and <strong>it is PR Friday</strong>. Post weight lifted, gained, or eaten plus all the other notables like ripping clothes, pressing females, and tossing children. Girls, I want to hear more out of you this time. After all, you can toss children too.</p>

    The epitome of 70’s Big

    When the website went live, one of the first things that my friend Chris did was compile a list of things that would or would not exhibit what 70’s Big is all about. I share his concern. You see, 70’s Big has been alive for the better part of 2009. You, the reader, are at a disadvantage. You may not intuitively know what is acceptable.<br /> <br /> Hell, you may open your tub of soy protein after gelling your hair while listening to Nickelback and sipping a smoothie. For god’s sakes, this is for your own good! Okay? I can’t have you going around talking to your friends about 70’s Big when you’re convincing someone that your shirt is fucshia with a Bud Light in your hand. And I’m pretty sure Rip would find the athleticism to backflip kick you in the jaw if you were convinced Crown Royal was the best kind of whiskey. Look, it’s just bad for my reputation if you talk about 70’s Big after shaving your chest, doing a few sets of curls and push-ups, then hitting up the bar with your favorite &#8220;whore-stink&#8221; cologne on.<br /> <br /> No, I can’t have that. There has to be some standards, dammit.<br />

  <p>Thankfully some of you are now committed to compete. This is good. Now we are going to talk about what you are going to be doing in preparation of that meet. We won’t get through all of it today, but consider it a little series to look forward to. I just want to go over the last week of training before a weightlifting meet. My friend Phil Stevens (who is in town right now with Charles Staley) will be our source for getting ready for a powerlifting meet.</p>
<p>You should be set up on some kind of strength program. If you are a novice, you should be on some kind of linear progression to get the most out of your body’s potential for strength gain from a local and systemic standpoint. Even a weightlifter should be taking advantage of some kind of linear progression, and it is easy to derive programs from the Starting Strength model.</p>
<p>What your program will consist of is dependent on if you know the lifts or not. Go back and read some of my posts on <a href="/?p=1301">Getting Into Weightlifting</a>, because you need to be taught the lifts. The programming for an early level weightlifter is dependent on so many variables, and it leaves the scope of this post (perhaps it will come later if you want to hear what I have to say). In any case, the lifts need to be learned and you need to have a decent amount of strength (which is sort of a relative term, but I digress). We are going to assume you are set up on some kind of strength program that incorporates the lifts. If you are not currently doing the lifts, you should probably progressively add them to your program to eventually look something like <a href="/?p=1315">this</a>. Easing your way into doing more snatches and jerks is a good idea so that your joints and structures can adapt to the new kinds of movement. I know I have had acromioclavicular joint (there is a little ligament that holds your collar bone to the shoulder blade, and it is near that pointy tip of your shoulder on top — for you non-anatomy folks) problems when I go from not jerking a lot to jerking a lot (stay focused in that sentence). It would prevent me from jerking heavy — usually nothing over 120 kg. I never had an issue with my wrists or elbows, but some may, so it is better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Bill Starr said: <strong>Patience + Persistence = Strength</strong></p>
<p>Now, let’s assume you are on a strength program that incorporates the lifts (my novices use the program I linked above). You really don’t need to do any tapering until the week of the meet because you are a novice. Tapering is something that will be dependent on the training advancement of the athlete (meaning what stage they are in their requirement for adaptable stresses) as well as other things like possible injuries or overtraining. However, in most situations, you will only need to change your program the week of the meet, especially if you are a novice.</p>
<p>The week of the meet you have a basic outline. Assuming the meet is Saturday, you will go heavier on Monday, medium on Wednesday, with an option of going very light on Thursday. Monday can either be a “max out day” if it isn’t clear what the person will open with or if there is potential to easily hit a weight that is higher than what the lifter has done in training (this person would be less experienced with the Olympic lifts, or they are still progressing quite well). If they are a bit more advanced, then the lifter would work up to the weight that they want to open with conservatively.</p>
<p>The opener for the snatch should be something the lifter can smoke and annihilate, especially if this is their first meet. You want confidence, you want ease, you want to put on a show. Shit, it doesn’t even matter if you are only power snatching and cleaning — that is preferable with some novices. I will say that again — <strong>you do NOT have to squat your snatch or clean</strong>. I see lots of new weightlifters unnecessarily squatting their lifts, which makes them slow and inefficient. There is no rule that demands you squat, and if the weight is light enough, there is no reason to do so. In my first meet, I power snatched 115, and 120, and did not finish my pull when I missed 125. So open with something easy, and power snatching is okay.</p>
<p>Work up to something that is very reasonable for the first attempt on that Monday training session. Do the same with clean and jerk — because you do NOT want to miss your openers. You don’t want to get into a rut at the meet, especially if this is a hobby for you. You want to set yourself up to be successful instead of being stupid and going for weights that are too much of a challenge. Remember that what you did in training means jack shit, you have to have it count in a sanctioned competition. Your third attempt may even be something under what your gym PR is, and that’s okay, because your goal, especially in the first meet, is to hit your lifts, have a good time, and feel confident that you had more left in you on that day. I promise it will be better than bombing out (I have had both scenarios, just trust me on this one).</p>
<p>Wednesday’s training session consists of working up to your last warm-up. This means that in both Monday and Wednesday, you are going to warm-up as you will on Saturday. For most people this means they will be taking less warm-ups, so just go ahead and get used to that on Monday and Wednesday. The idea on this day is to not miss any reps, continue the high you got from Monday’s training session, hit an easy last warm-up, and call it a day. One of my lifters, 15 year old Kyle, had a really good Monday and Wednesday training session. He didn’t PR on Monday or anything, but everything was running smoothly. This gave him excellent confidence while going into the Bill Starr Memorial Meet, and he PR’d on snatch, clean and jerk, and total. He had a really good day because we handled his week delicately to get his confidence high. I was extremely proud of him.</p>
<p>Thursday’s training session is only going to be some light stuff. If it were me, I would only snatch around 80 and clean and jerk 120 or so, and I did 130/157 at the meet. In other words, just some nice, easy light stuff to get some technique practice. If the lifter has specific cues they have been working on, this is the time to work on it. Realistically, this day isn’t necessary. If you need another day of technique to be comfortable, then keep it, but I dropped it out of my training (because I wanted my AC joints to rest).</p>
<p>That would constitute what you could do to prepare the week of the meet. There are plenty of ways to go about this, but I have found this little method works pretty well to get a beginner ready for a meet. However, the whole thing is dependent on the training program leading into this week. Over the next few days, I will get into what will happen the day of the meet, as well as some other considerations.</p>

  <p>I’d like to file a formal complaint. This is serious, so I want you to listen…</p>
<p><strong>Some of you are sandbagging, and I don’t like it.</strong></p>
<p>I need to direct my malcontent towards someone, so I am going to choose my pals Ruth and Sean, from <a href="http://www.crossfitintrepid.com/trainers/">CrossFit Intrepid</a>. Yeah, you guys are totally busted. Gant told me all about how you haven’t competed in a weightlifting meet. Gant met them last weekend when he presented at a seminar/workshop, and I met the couple at one of Rip’s barbell seminars at the end of last year.</p>
<p>These two goons have some serious potential in Olympic weightlifting, and would do pretty decently in a meet…yesterday. Apparently they said some hogwash to Gant about “not being good enough” or something. Gant’s response is that you aren’t going to be good enough when you first start competing, but you have to compete in order to get good at competing. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>There are plenty of legitimate reasons for not competing, but I am not convinced that these two have a valid reason. They were opening a new gym, and things were probably hectic, but Sean snatched 60 or 70 kilos the day I coached him at the barbell seminar…after squatting, pressing, bench pressing, deadlifting, and power cleaning that weekend. The dude has something like a 39 inch vertical (he played division I football) and is pretty damn strong. He would make a HELL of a 94 kg lifter — as in he would qualify for national level stuff pretty fast. And Ruth is a fiery little gal who is pretty strong and explosive.</p>

<p>I told them both right away when I saw them move that they would be good at this sport, and they seemed enthused. We even talked for 15 or 20 minutes about a program they could do when they got home. And the silly bastards never competed! All kidding aside, these are two very nice people, very good athletes, and both pretty damn strong. It is just a bummer to see quality potential wasted. I am sure there are plenty of people just like them — folks that know they will enjoy a competitive endeavor but are for some reason avoiding it.</p>
<p>If you are avoiding competition because you don’t think you are good enough, then you are a Silly Person. The whole point is to test yourself in a competitive environment. I promise that you will enjoy yourself — as long as you set yourself up to do well in that first meet (I will talk more about this tomorrow). If there is a chance that you might be decently competitive in a given weight class, then you have more incentive to get better, but you will never know this without ever competing.</p>
<p>If you think a sport might be fun to compete in, then what the hell are you waiting for? Go online, find a competition, circle the date, and train for it. You’ll thank me later, you buffoon.</p>

  <p>Paul’s wife had a baby. This baby’s name is Gabe, and he lost 13% of his bodyweight due to jaundice (I had jaundice when I was a newborn too). After that, he gained 3 lbs. 4.5 oz in 18 days, which is a growth rate of 2.9 oz/day. The average baby will grow 1 oz/day in the third and fourth weeks of life. In other words, Gabe is already gettin’ 70’s Big and makin’ daddy proud.</p>

<p>I am long over-due with this, but my friend Mike Hom pulled 505×5 at a body weight of 185. I am trying to talk him into growing into the 94 kg class, and he is doing a decent job at it.</p>

  <p><strong>Note: You will find Monday’s post below — this is just a side post because I did not want to take away from the article posted.</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen who are on your quest to 70’s Bigdom, I am excited (physically or emotionally, I can’t tell) to announce the advent of the <strong>70’s Big Workshop</strong>.</p>
<p>This interactive lecture style formatted workshop will include material that teaches a coach or trainee how to get 70’s Big along with a butt load of training material that you can only obtain from a knowledgeable coach or through years of experience — in other words, the little things that make a big difference in your training.</p>
<p>While we could host the first workshop at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club, I figured I would make it more accessible to Dallas/Fort Worth by coming to the area. However, this requires a willing gym, hence this message. If you own or are part of a gym in the DFW area and are interested in hosting this brand new workshop, <a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com">e-mail me</a> (there is something in it for the gym owner).</p>
<p>Also: yes I am interested in other areas within driving distance of Wichita Falls — east, west, and south Texas, Oklahoma, etc.</p>

<p><em>For those of you asking about shirts, they will be going to print within the next 10 days.</em></p>
