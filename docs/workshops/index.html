<p>The <strong>70’s Big Seminar Weekend</strong> on January 5th and 6th near Washington D.C. is a combination of a **Lifting Seminar **on Saturday and a **Mobility and Programming Seminar **on Sunday. The Lifting Seminar teaches, improves, and solidifies lifting mechanics and technique in the squat, press, deadlift, power clean, and some assistance exercises while the Mobility and Programming Seminar includes lecture and demonstration on various mobility techniques as well as lectures on programming fundamentals, programming strength, programming conditioning, how to combine strength and conditioning, programming for specific goals/competitions, and how to deal with set backs and injuries. The programming lectures essentially teach attendees “how to program”.</p>
<p>This is a unique weekend for three reasons: 1) it will be the last 70’s Big Seminar for a while, 2) it will be professionally filmed, and 3) there is a dedicated mobility portion on Sunday. I’ve already started prepping the material for the seminar; it will be the best one to date. The mobility portion will feature material that has not been taught on the site or in past seminars. Anybody who is unsure about attending should note that there will <em>not</em> be another seminar any time soon, so this is the chance to get hands on coaching, mobility work, and programming lectures. This seminar is appropriate for both coaches and trainees.</p>
<p><strong>Attendees can attend one day or the other for $175, or attend the entire weekend for $300. To purchase, use the button below (please confirm your selection on the payment page):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Previous seminar attendees are eligible for a discount only when buying the full weekend (<a href="mailto:Justin@70sbig.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> with “SEMINAR” in the subject line for details).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>
<p>The Saturday and Sunday locations will be at the same CrossFit gym. Though we aren’t lifting on Sunday, the mobility portion will require comfortable, athletic style clothing (no denim, but flannel is acceptable).</p>

<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>
<p>The **70’s Big Lifting Seminar **is designed to teach, improve, and solidify technique in barbell training in beginning or experienced lifters. After a short, basic lecture on lifting fundamentals, attendees will squat, press, deadlift, and power clean. At this point, we free style depending on what the group wants to go over but typically highlight RDLs, barbell rows, rack pulls, and other beneficial assistance movements. The practical sessions are designed to teach or improve lifting mechanics and efficiency.</p>

This portion will last two or three hours. <em>Note: This is a new addition, hence the undefined scheduling.</em></p>
<p>Programming lectures will teach attendees how to program training to result in bigger, stronger, and more conditioned trainees, lifters, or athletes.
